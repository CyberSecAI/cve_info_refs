## Product Information:

With CP Contact Form with Paypal you can insert a contact form into a
WordPress website and connect it to a PayPal payment.

## Vulnerability Description:

The forms in the admin area of the plugin allows CSRF. This gives the
capacity for the attacker to add new forms, modify existing form settings,
launch XSS attacks, export CSV files of the messages, delete forms, and
perform SQL Injection.

## Proof of Concept:

<h3>CSRF - Action Links</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="

</ul>

<h3>CSRF, XSS, SQLi - Settings form</h3>
<form action="

Note: Payments processed through the plugin are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) – Directive (EU) that comes into full effect on 14 September, 2019.

#### Language Support

The Contact Form with PayPal plugin is compatible with all charsets. The troubleshoot area contains options to change the encoding of the plugin database tables if needed.

Translations are supported through PO/MO files located in the Contact Form with PayPal plugin folder “languages”.

Multiple language translations are already included in the plugin.

**Requesting address at PayPal:** If you are selling tangible items and you need to request the customer address at PayPal you can enable that option into the settings field “Request address at PayPal” available separately for each contact form.

**Taxes at PayPal:** You can indicate the taxes to charge at PayPal over the “request cost” as a percent into the settings field “Taxes (percent)”. Each contact form can have a different taxes setting.

**Edit submit button label:** You can easily edit the submit button label into each contact form settings. The **class=”cp\_subbtn”** can be used to modify the button styles. The styles can be applied into any of the CSS files of your theme or into the CSS file “cp-contact-form-with-paypal\css\stylepublic.css”. For further modifications the submit button is located at the end of the file “cp\_contactformpp\_public\_int.inc.php”.

**Use a specific field from the form for the payment amount:** If a field is selected in this settings field, any price in the selected field will be added to the above request cost. Use this field for example for having an open donation amount. This field is more useful in the pro version since it supports adding more fields to the contact form.

**Button to change status to paid:** The messages list contains a button to change the status of the “Not paid” contact form messages to “Paid”. This is mainly for administrative purposes.

**Export data to CSV/Excel:** The messages list contains an option to export the contact messages received from the contact form to a CSV/Excel file. This way you can export the email address and other data from the contact messages to other applications or manage the data in Excel. The filters in the message list apply also to the exported CSV/Excel file.

**Enabling donation layout:** The plugin supports enabling the PayPal donation layout, this way a payment page improved for donations is displayed to the donors.

## FAQ

### Q: What means each field in the PayPal contact form settings area?

A: The product’s page contains detailed information about each contact form field and customization:

https://cfpaypal.dwbooster.com

### Q: Where can I publish the CP Contact Form with PayPal with the PayPal button?

A: You can publish the PayPal contact forms / PayPal button into pages and posts. Other versions of the plugin also allow publishing the CP Contact Form with PayPal as a widget.

### Q: The PayPal payment has been received but the status of the Message isn’t being set to Paid. What happens?

A: First check if you are testing the CP Contact Form with PayPal on a local website or in an online website. Note you should test this feature into an online website (local websites cannot receive PayPal IPN connections).

After that initial verification, please check if the IPN notifications are enabled at your PayPal account. Check also the IPN logs at your PayPal account to confirm if are being received.

### Q: I’m not receiving the emails after PayPal payment.

A: Please check if the messages are marked as “paid” or “not paid” in the contact form messages page.

If the contact form messages are marked as paid then the problem is that your WordPress isn’t delivering the emails. You should setup the WordPress to deliver the emails according to your mail server settings. You may have to ask to your web hosting support about the requirements to send emails from WordPress/PHP with their hosting service.

On the other hand if the contact form messages aren’t marked as “paid” then the PayPal IPN connection isn’t being received. Read the previous FAQ entry for information and solution.

### Q: How can I customize the style of the PayPal button?

A: The PayPal button is located at the end of the file “cp\_contactformpp\_public\_int.inc.php”. It’s a classic submit button, you can change it to any other button that submits the CP Contact Form with PayPal.

### Q: How can I have an actual PayPal button as the submit button for the form instead of the default grey button?

A: At the end of the file “cp\_contactformpp\_public\_int.inc.php” replace this:

```
    <?php _e($button_label); ?>

```

… by this:

```
    <img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynow_LG.gif" />

```

You may also want to change the background color of the button with the CSS style class=”pbSubmit”.

### Q: How can I add specific fields into the contact form message?

A: There is a tag named %INFO% that is replaced with all the information posted from the form, however you can use also optional tags for specific fields into the contact form.

For doing that, click the desired contact form field into the contact form builder and in the settings box for that field there is a read-only setting named “Field tag for the message (optional):”. Copy & paste that tag into the message text and after the form submission (after clicking the PayPal button and receiving the PayPal payment) that tag will be replaced with the text entered in the form field.

### Q: Can I use this with PayPal Personal accounts

A: Yes, you can use it with PayPal Personal accounts and also with PayPal Premium and PayPal Business accounts.

### Q: Can I accept credit card payments through PayPal directly without forcing the users to create a PayPal account?

A: That depends of the type of your PayPal account and its status. In most cases PayPal Business accounts and PayPal premium accounts allow accepting payments from users that don’t have PayPal accounts. In this case after clicking the PayPal button the PayPal page will appear with two options “Login at your PayPal account” and “Pay directly without having to register”. The title of the options at PayPal may vary.

### Q: I’m having problems with non-latin characters in the PayPal contact form.

A: New: Use the “throubleshoot area” to change the character encoding. If you prefer to do that manually , in most cases the problem is located in the database table collation/encoding. The solution is to change the table encoding to UTF-8. You can do that from the PHPMyAdmin provided by your hosting service.

For example, if your WordPress database table prefix is “wp\_” (the default one) then run these queries (will update only the PayPal contact form tables):

```
alter table wp_cp_contact_form_paypal_discount_codes convert to character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
alter table wp_cp_contact_form_paypal_settings convert to character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
alter table wp_cp_contact_form_paypal_posts convert to character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;

```

If you don’t know how to do that, contact our support service and we will help you.

### Q: The contact form doesn’t appear in the public website. Solution?

A: In the “throubleshoot area” (located below the list of forms in the settings area) change the “Script load method” from “Classic” to “Direct”.

### Q: How can I duplicate a form and its settings?

A: Use the “Clone” button located in the contact form’s list. That button will duplicate the contact form structure and all its settings.

### Q: How to setup the CP Contact Form with PayPal to accept a PayPal donation?

A: To accept a PayPal donation (an open donation amount) just put a zero (0) on the “Request Cost” settings field. That way after filling the contact form clicking the PayPal button (contact form submit button) the PayPal payment page will appear letting the user to enter the amount to pay.

### Q: How to show a company name instead the email address at the PayPal payment page?

A: To show a company name instead the email address at the PayPal payment page (after the contact form submission) you have to use a PayPal Standard Business account. Note that in Personal and Premier Standard accounts the email is shown instead the company name since there is no company name in that case.

Note also that if you are testing the contact form in the SandBox mode then the email may be shown instead the name of the production account.

### Q: Are the forms GDPR compliant?

A: In all plugin versions you can turn off IP tracking to avoid saving that user info. Full GDPR compliant forms can be built using the commercial versions of the plugin.

### Q: How to enable the refund processing feature?

A: Into the plugin settings select the option “Process refunds through this plugin?” as “Yes”. In addition to that you have to indicate the PayPal (NVP) – API UserName, Password and Signature.

When done to refund a payment just use the refund button that appears for each transaction in the settings area.

It had been working for years. But recently, it crashed my website.Luckily, WordPress sent me an email indicating it was this extension that was causing my website to crash and sent me a link to access the website in a fail-safe mode to correct the problem…

Hi,

I discovered Cross-Site Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting and SQL
Injection in CP Contact Form with Paypal Wordpress Plugin v1.1.5 which was
responsibly disclosed to the vendor who fixed the issues in v1.1.6.

I request a CVE for the same.
