Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9426

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Manual Image Crop` plugin. Specifically, the `postId` parameter passed to the `mic_editor_window` action in `admin-ajax.php` is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly uses the `postId` parameter in the `mic_editor_window` action without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the page.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability is further compounded by the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, which means an attacker can potentially trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL, leading to various malicious outcomes, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the page
    *   Stealing user information

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `postId` parameter. This URL is typically distributed through social engineering techniques such as phishing or is placed on a website.
*   **Targeted User:** The attack targets authenticated users of the WordPress site. Even users with low privileges, such as subscribers, are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the knowledge to insert malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable `postId` parameter.
*   **Ability to distribute the malicious URL:** The attacker needs to find a way to make the user visit the crafted link. This can be achieved via social engineering, malicious links on other websites, or other phishing techniques.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content confirms that this vulnerability exists in version 1.10 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was reported in 2015, the plugin is marked as not being tested with the latest 3 major releases of WordPress, which could indicate the vulnerability is not fixed.
*   The provided example verifies the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Marcin Probola.
