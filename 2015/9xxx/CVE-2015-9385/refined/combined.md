For such a simple plugin, it took me too long minutes to realise that it doesn’t work as expected. The customisation doesn’t allow transparent background. It displays both quote and tips at the same place!!

The random order with and without page reload make this a unique and attractive feature of any website.
The biggest problem is that the quotes and tips are shown in the same box. I can’t figure out who would want their quotes to be displayed in the same box as tips. It makes no sense. There are really two separate functions here: Quotes and Tips.
The second problem is that there is no way to assign a category to each quote or tip, and to cycle through those quotes or tips belonging to a specific category. I need to show one set of quotes on one page and another set of quotes on another page.

This plugin is exactly what I needed–a randomly selected quote from my repository displayed in my sidebar. I was having trouble getting the daily quote to change and it turns out WPEngine has “Allow ORDER BY RAND” disabled by default in Site Settings. After enabling that, it worked great. The support team went above and beyond to help me troubleshoot the issue. Highly recommended!

It’s not the fanciest, but it works if you want something that’s fast, easy & looks good.

Good plugin, but would like to have:
1. The ability to select the display or just advice, or just quotes, or both together.
2. The ability to configure the parameters of font plug-in installation is now killed CSS themes.
