Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential CVE:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input (`pmfb_tid` parameter) within SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive data)
    - Data modification (altering existing data)
    - Data deletion
    - Potential complete compromise of the WordPress site and server

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` file with specific actions:
    - `action=pmfb_cc`
    - `action=pmfb_mailchimp`
- **Vulnerable parameter:** The `pmfb_tid` parameter within the POST data is the entry point for the injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication, they can exploit the vulnerability remotely without any access to the admin panel
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress site.

**Specific Vulnerable functions**
- `Plugmatter_FeatureBox::pmfb_cc()`
- `Plugmatter_FeatureBox::pmfb_mailchimp()`

**Additional Information:**
- The plugin was closed on August 12, 2021, due to security issues.
- The reported version is 2.0.13, however the plugin's meta shows version 2.1.39. It is unclear if the issue was addressed in later versions of the plugin.
