What a shame, product looks really nice, but after editing a few times I keep getting error message and support is not responsive. So I can‚Äôt use it. I know its free but I would consider paying if support was available.

Plugmatter Optin Feature Box is an incredibly helpful tool to capture emails from potential subscribers on a prominent position in your blog theme. Additionally, Syed and the rest of the team are always there to help you with any technical issue (although the interface is pretty straightforward). And the best of it: it‚Äôs free!

The feature box is going to be too tall for many sites (considering its location), and it doesn‚Äôt work well visually in a boxed layout.

Worked perfectly for me. Paid for the Pro version. Easy to set up. Looks beautiful. I think it‚Äôs more visitor-friendly than pop-ups. Installed 10 days ago, and sign-ups have increased 50%.
