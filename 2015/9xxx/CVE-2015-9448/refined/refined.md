The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities within the SendPress Newsletters plugin for WordPress, specifically version 1.1.7.21. These vulnerabilities include SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**1. SQL Injection (emails_in_queue())**

*   **Root Cause:** The `listid` parameter in the `emails_in_queue()` function is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization when processing the `listid` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion of database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sp-queue` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `listid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated administrator account to access the vulnerable endpoint.

**2. SQL Injection (get_subscriber())**

*   **Root Cause:** The `subscriberID` parameter in the `get_subscriber()` function is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** Missing input sanitization for the `subscriberID` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the previous SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, compromising database integrity and confidentiality.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sp-subscribers&view=subscriber` endpoint, with the payload in the `subscriberID` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated administrator account.

**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `listID` and `subscriberID` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding or sanitization for the `listID` and `subscriberID` parameters in the subscriber view.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting GET requests to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sp-subscribers&view=subscriber` endpoint and injecting malicious JavaScript in the `listID` and/or `subscriberID` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated administrator account.
