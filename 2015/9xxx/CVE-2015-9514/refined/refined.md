The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads, a WordPress plugin. It mentions a vulnerability related to the usage of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from using `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions with an unescaped or untrusted URL as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unescaped URLs passed to `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions. These functions are used to modify URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided text doesn't explicitly specify the impact, but it implies that it could allow an attacker to inject malicious URLs. This could potentially redirect users to malicious sites, or could be used to execute arbitrary code via XSS, if the crafted URL is later rendered in the site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is related to how URLs are constructed and manipulated within the plugin.
- Attackers could inject malicious URLs through parameters that are later used by `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to find a way to influence the URL parameters passed to the vulnerable functions within the Easy Digital Downloads plugin.
- This could be through manipulating user-provided input or other vectors that allow control over the URL.

The content highlights a specific scenario where the vulnerability exists, not just the general use of the functions. The key is that the third parameter is an untrusted URL.
