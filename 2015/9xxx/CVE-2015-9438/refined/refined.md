Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Display Widgets plugin version 2.03 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
-  The plugin fails to sanitize the `id_base`, `widget_number`, and `instance` parameters (specifically within the 'other_ids' key of the JSON within the `instance` parameter).

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the plugin's output.
-  This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    -  Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    -  Stealing user session cookies.
    -  Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
-  The vulnerable parameters are `id_base`, `widget_number`, and `instance`. The `instance` parameter contains a JSON object where the 'other_ids' key accepts unsanitized values.
-  An attacker can craft a malicious payload in these parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site, such as a subscriber.
- The attacker can use a simple HTML form to submit a malicious POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The provided example demonstrates how an attacker can inject an HTML image tag with an `onerror` event to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
- The vulnerable function call stack includes `DWPlugin::show_widget_options` and `DWPlugin::show_hide_widget_options`.
- The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin directory due to security issues.
-  Multiple reports in the comments section of the plugin page indicate that it was compromised, had backdoor code and published spam.
