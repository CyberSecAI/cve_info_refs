No one wants spam published on their websites. This plugin needs to be permanently banned.

Since this plugin has been purchased by someone else it got worse. It’s now the 3rd or 4th time the plugin has been taken offline to get fixed, to appear back online for a few days only to get kicked from the Repo again. There must be serious issues with it. DO NOT USE IT UNLESS THE DEVELOPER PROPERLY FIXES IT AND PUBLISHES A STATEMENT where he/she explains what happened and what they did to fix it.

One of the most appreciated plugins in my arsenal. Saves me from creating additional page templates and sidebar areas.

All the widget filtering I need in just one plugin. Thank you for this, and I wish for this plugin to last.
