The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads. Based on the discussion, the vulnerability lies in the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions with an unescaped/untrusted URL as the third parameter.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the improper use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions within the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Specifically, when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL, it becomes vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the URL passed to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could potentially redirect users to a malicious site or execute unwanted code within the context of the vulnerable website, leading to various security risks such as phishing or cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL which is passed as a third parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject a malicious URL into the application, likely through user-controlled input that the application uses in conjunction with those functions.
