Bought this a long time ago and it worked so well and I was happy with it.
Since December it’s not working any more.
As it’s a commercial plugin which we paid for an update or at least a statement from the developer would be nice…

Suddenly it stopped working. It hides the content but it doesn’t display social networks, just an empty space… (WP 5.6)
