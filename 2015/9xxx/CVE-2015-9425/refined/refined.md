Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9425

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the "Social Locker | BizPanda" plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin doesn't sanitize the `licensekey` parameter in a POST request and the `opanda_status` parameter in a GET request, allowing injection of HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks through the `licensekey` and `opanda_status` parameters.
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The POST request handling the `licensekey` parameter lacks CSRF protection making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the admin interface.
- This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal administrator session cookies.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
    - Redirect the admin to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Potentially gain complete control over the WordPress site if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters:
   - `licensekey` parameter via a POST request to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=opanda-item&page=license-manager-sociallocker-next`
   - `opanda_status` parameter via a GET request to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=opanda-item&page=leads-bizpanda`
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL or form containing the malicious payload in the respective parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce an authenticated administrator to visit a crafted URL or submit a crafted form.
- The attacker does not necessarily require any access or privilege to the WordPress dashboard.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information provides details not explicitly mentioned in the CVE description.
- The plugin has been closed due to guideline violations and is no longer available, however, the vulnerabilities remain for any users still running the plugin.
- The identified vulnerable parameters `licensekey` and `opanda_status`, and the specific locations in the plugin files are provided.
