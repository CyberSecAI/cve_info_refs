## Description

Lazy loading makes your site load faster and saves bandwidth.

This plugin replaces all your post images, post thumbnails, gravatar images and content iframes with a placeholder and loads the content as it gets close to enter the browser window when the visitor scrolls the page. Also works with text widgets.

Since it works with iframes, it also covers embedded videoes from YouTube, Vimeo etc.

You can also lazy load other images and iframes in your theme, by using a simple filter.

Non-javascript visitors gets the original element in noscript.

Compatible with the [RICG Responsive Images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ricg-responsive-images/) plugin for responsive images.

Please let me know if you have any issues. Fastest way to get a response is by Twitter: https://twitter.com/bjornjohansen

[Development happens at GitHub](https://github.com/bjornjohansen/bj-lazy-load). Pull requests are very welcome.

### Optional usage

If you have images output in custom templates or want to lazy load other images in your theme, you may pass the HTML through a filter:

```
<?php
$img_html = '<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="">';
$img_html = apply_filters( 'bj_lazy_load_html', $img_html );
echo $img_html;
?>

```

Note for developers: The filter has a priority of 10.

## Installation

1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the ‘bj-lazy-load’ folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

## FAQ

Installation Instructions

1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the ‘bj-lazy-load’ folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

Whoa, this plugin is using JavaScript. What about visitors without JS?

No worries. They get the original element in a noscript element. No Lazy Loading for them, though.

I’m using a CDN. Will this plugin interfere?

Lazy loading works just fine. The images will still load from your CDN.

How can I verify that the plugin is working?

Check your HTML source or see the magic at work in Web Inspector, FireBug or similar.

Часто использую на сайтах клиентов.
Работает всё четко, но есть опасения, что присутствуют дыры.
Вердикт: если WP старый и новый плагин не работает – использовать этот!

My suggestion would be to set the threshold from 200 to 300 now my site is not only far faster but also loads correctly.
I also use plugins like…
Far Future Expiration Plugin
Fast Velocity Minify
Webcraftic Clearfy – WordPress optimization plugin
To get my speeds this high.
The only thing I would suggest is an update from the developer so its inline with the latest WordPress. However, on my latest WordPress, my website still seems faultless with this outdated plugin.

I downloaded this plugin because I wanted my images to load better for my blog readers. It works great, and once setup, I can just let it do its thing.
