Subject: CVE_for_Vulnerability_theholidaycalendar
To: cve-assign () mitre org

Dear,

In a recent research conducted in the "The Holiday Calendar" plugin (
<http://www.theholidaycalendar.com> /
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-holiday-calendar>) I found vulnerability
related at Cross Site Scripting.

. The Holiday Calendar plugin Cross Site Scripting Issues

This problem was confirmed in the following versions of the "The Holiday
Calendar", other prior versions maybe also affected.

Version: 1.11.2
(Tested with Mozilla Firefox Browser)

DETAILS

The "The Holiday Calendar" plugin (<http://www.theholidaycalendar.com> /
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-holiday-calendar>) is affected by Cross
Site Scripting. The variable "thc-month" do not sanitize input data,
allowing attacker to store malicious javascript code in a page.

Proof of Concept to exploit the vulnerability:

<http://dimensaonet.com.br/blog/eco-dimensao-workshop-inscricao/?thc-month=201504%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Eprompt%2899%29%3C/script%3E>

<http://sabreschool.com/?post_type=thc-events&date=2015-04-04&country=GB&thc-month=201504%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Eprompt%2899%29%3C/script%3E>

<http://zehaschmidtke.de/wp/events/?date=2015-05-25&dateFormat=2&country=DE&readmore=1&thc-month=201504%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Eprompt%2899%29%3C/script%3E>

CREDITS

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Luciano Pedreira
(a.k.a. shark)

I wonder how to create a CVE for this publication?

best regards,

Luciano Pedreira

## Description

This calendar comes as a widget that shows your upcoming events. If you want you can automatically import the holidays from http://www.theholidaycalendar.com.

Two views are available: calendar view and list view.

If you choose to import the holidays they are fetched from a webservice. This happens asynchronous so your website will not get slow.

For more information about the webservice visit: http://www.mva7.nl/the-holiday-calendar-webservice-manual.html

I have the Calendar set to US Holidays, however, Holidays such as Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, 4th of July etc. are not appearing. Sure, I can manually add them but there is no feature to repeat yearly. Last post on their FB page was September 2016.
Update… more Holidays have been added. 7/2/2019

If you are looking for a good plugin that doesn’t intervene the layout or the style of your current theme, this is it.
I checked so many calendar plugins and I can tell you, this plugin is one of the best, if not the best. Very simple and easy to use. The support from Mva7 was great and he includes the Venezuelan holidays on the calendar as I requested.
Thanks again, Mva7
Keep the good work

We have used the plugin for a long time now, and it worked for us. We only had the problem With that old events showed up in the event list, but that was solved fast by the plugin owner.
Unfortunately we will have to replace it now, because after the last update of several plugins our site broke down, and we deactivated the newley updated plugins and reactivated them one by one. The Holiday calender plugin refuse to be reactivated, so we have now lost all our events and have to start all over again with a new plugin. The support of this plugin is not working, so when we cant solve the problem ourselves, we just have to make a replacement instead.
We could have given 5 stars, but due to the lack of support, we ended up With 3.

After you activate this plugin, it will add an Events custom post type in the backend of your WordPress website. Adding a new event is as simple as adding a new post. No bloatware. No adware. If you know CSS, you can easily style the look and feel of the calendar or the widget and make it blend in with the rest of your website.
