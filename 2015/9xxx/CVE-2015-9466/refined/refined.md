Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9466 (Although the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided content clearly relates to a vulnerability in "WTI Like Post" plugin).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection.
*   The `WtiGetRealIpAddress()` function within the "WTI Like Post" plugin improperly handles HTTP header parameters (`HTTP_CLIENT_IP`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED`, `HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR`, and `HTTP_FORWARDED`). Specifically, it appears that these headers are not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The injection is blind, meaning the attacker does not directly see the output of the SQL query. They infer the result based on timing or application behavior.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically using the `wti_like_post_process_vote` action.
*   The vulnerable parameters are injected through HTTP headers such as `X-forwarded-for`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need local access to the server or the WordPress installation.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No prior authentication or login is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to send crafted HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional details from the provided content**

*   The specific version vulnerable to the exploit is **1.4.2**.
*   The vendor was informed about the vulnerability on **10.03.2015**, but a fix wasn't released as of the date of the report (**05.07.2015**).
*   The plugin was closed on March 7, 2024, due to this security issue.

**Note:**
The information from the plugin page on wordpress.org confirms the plugin was closed due to a security issue. This, along with the email about SQL injection, aligns with the CVE description which was a placeholder.
