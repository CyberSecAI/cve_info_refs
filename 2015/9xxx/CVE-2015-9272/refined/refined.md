Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `vw_upload.php` file of the VideoWhisper Video Presentation WordPress plugin. This file allows unauthenticated users to upload files remotely.
*   The file extension check is flawed; it only checks the last 4 characters of the filename against a whitelist of allowed extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The script doesn't validate user access and allows anyone to upload files to the server.
*   **Insufficient File Extension Check:** The script only checks the last four characters of the filename, which can be easily bypassed.
*   **Bypassable PHP Check:** The `strstr($filename,'.php')` check can be bypassed using extensions like `.Php`.
*   **Incomplete Patch:**  A previous attempt to fix the vulnerability was not sufficient, specifically related to php execution. Attackers can upload files with extensions like `.phtml`, `.rhtml`, and `.pht` which are not in the apache mime.types and directly execute code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading specially crafted files such as `.shtml` (if SSI is enabled) or `.phtml` files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload various file types, including executable code, potentially leading to further attacks and compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated File Upload:** An attacker can directly send a POST request to the vulnerable `vw_upload.php` file with a malicious file and a room name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be a user of the WordPress site or have any special privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable script location `wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Larry W. Cashdollar (@\_larry0)
*   The vendor was notified but initially refused to fix it.
*   The plugin has since been closed and is not available for download due to the security issues.
*   The exploit code provided demonstrates uploading a `upexp.phtml` file to execute PHP code.
