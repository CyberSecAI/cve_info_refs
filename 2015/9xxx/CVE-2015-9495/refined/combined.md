[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/syndication-links/)

## Description

It supports adding links to your WordPress posts, pages, and comments, indicating where a syndicated copy is, in the form of a text or icon link. You can do this

manually or with supported plugins. Also contains a generic UI for syndicating to other sites through your site or a Micropub Client.

### Privacy and Data Storage Information

This plugin stores syndication links, which can be attached to any post, page, or comment. They can be added to custom post types by filter.

For webmention initiated comments, this information will be added by parsing the source of the webmention.

It is assumed if you send a webmention, you consent to share this information if it is publicly shared on your page. Our recommendation

is that site owners should take down information on request.

For comments initiated on the site, there is built-in way to add these links. For posts, they are typically added by retrieving information stored by other plugins for display. It is assumed

that by installing this plugin, as its intent is to display these links, that you wish to display them.

### Settings

Settings for the Syndication Links plugin can be found in the main WordPress “Settings” tab in the

admin dashboard, or if the [Indieweb plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb) is installed, under the Indieweb tab. The options provided allow for various ways of presenting the syndication links in posts. Syndication Links by default will add links to the content. You can remove this in your plugin if you wish to call the display function directly.

The settings include the following options as follows with either a set of buttons, a check box (with a check indicating that the feature is “on”) or an optional text field:

* **Display Text** – Offers options to display text only, icons only, icons and text, and no display(hidden icons).
* **Size** – Choice of small, medium, or large size icons.
* **Black Icons** – Checking the box defaults to a “black” social media icon set.
* **Show on Front Page, Archive Page, and Search Results** – If checked the icons will show on pages other than a single view. If not checked, the icons will be hidden by the links will remain.
* **Show on Feed** – If checked the icons will show in your RSS feed as well
* **Text Before Links** – This is the text that appears before the Display Text/Icons (as indicated above). The default text is “Syndicated to:” but can be modified if desired.

**Note**: The particular CSS of your theme may change the display and output of the text and some of the icons.

### Supported POSSE plugins and implementations

The plugin supports automatically pulling data from plugins that syndicate your content so you don’t need to do it manually. For anything not built in, integation is easy with a simple filter for potential use with any other plugin.

* [Social Networks Autoposter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/) – Syndication Links supports Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr since version 1.0.0
* [Tumblr Crosspostr](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-crosspostr) – Supports Syndication Links since version 0.8.1
* [WordPress Crossposter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crosspost) – Supports Syndication Links since version 0.3.2
* [Diasposter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/diasposter/) – Supports Syndication Links since version 0.1.8
* [WP-To\_Twitter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-to-twitter/) – Supported by the plugin since version 4.2.3

Using the optional Syndication feature(disabled by default) you can syndicate your posts to:

* [Bridgy](https://brid.gy) – Bridgy is a service that allows you to post to various sites. Signup is required. It currently supports Github, Mastodon and Flickr. The plugin supports Bridgy Publish via Micropub by default.
* [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy) – Bridgy Fed is a service that allows you to interact with federated social networks using webmentions.
* [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) – Micro.blog is a social network and publishing platform for independent microblogs, created by Manton Reece. It uses a custom feed you can add to Micro.blog to support this.
* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) – Pinboard is a bookmarking site. The support for this is currently only enabled if you have Post Kinds enabled, due to the difficulty in getting a URL. It will bookmark the URL of any object you are citing.
* Custom Webmention Syndication – Add any site that supports publishing by sending a webmention by configuring it in the settings page

Will be looking to integrate with other plugins to add more options and invite developers to add support if they wish as the interface is simple.

The goal of the interface is not only can you syndicate via Micropub, but in the editor using a simple checkbox.

## Installation

1. Upload the folder ‘syndication-links’ to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

Or install through the WordPress Plugin Directory.

## FAQ

### How do I prevent the links from being automatically added to the content?

You will have to add the following code to your theme `add_filter( 'syndication_links_display', '__return_false' );` and then you can call get\_syndication\_links() directly in your theme. You should add

this to the init hook.

* `get\_post\_syndication\_links( $post, $args ) – Returns the HTML for a post.
* `get_comment_syndication_links( $comment, $args ) - Returns the HTML for a comment.

  ** $args

  ***`style`- Defaults to ul

  ***`text`- Display text, defaults to settings option

  ***`icons`- Display icons, defaults to settings option

  ***`container-css`- Class to wrap entire syndication links in

  ***`single-css`- Class to wrap a single link in

  ***`text-css` – Class to wrap the text before the links in

### How can I look up the original if I have a syndication link?

If you add `?original-of=` and the URL-encoded URL it will return the post that has that URL stored. As no two posts should have the same two syndication links it will by default only return the first.

If you want to do this with a form, there is a function you can add to your theme called `get_original_of_form()` and a widget that calls this. Like the search form if you have a

originalofform.php in your theme folder the function will return it so you can customize the form.

### What filters are available to modify output?

* `syn_rewrite_secure( $domains )` – $domains is an array of domain names to rewrite to https if found
* `syn_metabox_types( $screens )` – $screens would be an array of post types to add the Syndication Link metabox to.
* `syn_network_strings( $strings )` – $strings is an array of descriptive text strings by domain name
* `syn_add_links( $urls, $post_ID )` – (Deprecated) $urls is an array of retrieved links from $post\_ID
* `get_post_syndication_links( $urls, $post_ID)` – Replaces syn\_add\_links.
* `get_comment_syndication_links( $urls, $comment_ID` – Filters an array of retrieved comment syndication links.
* `syn_links_display_defaults( $defaults )` – Filter the defaults for displaying Syndication Links
* `syndication_link_checked( $checked, $uid, $post_ID )` – Will check a syndication provider($uid) when loaded. The post ID is passed through to allow more specific targeting.
* `syndication_link_disabled( $disabled, $uid, $post_ID )` – Will disable the checkbox for a syndication provider($uid) when loaded. The post ID is passed through to allow more specific targeting.
* `syn_link_title( $title, $name )` – Allows you to set the title string for Links. Example, pinboard => Pinboard.
* `syn_link_mapping( $icon, $url )` – Allows you to override or set the mapping from URL to icon name.
* `pre_syn_link_icon( $icon, $name )` – Allows you to provide a custom icon. Icons by default are SVG, not URL or filenames.
* `syndication_links_display( true )` – Adds Syndication Links to content display. Set to false if the theme supports this.

It’s convenient to have remote links all in the footer, where they’re noticeable but not obtrusive, and marked up so that IndieWeb software will recognize them. Works great with both WordPress and ClassicPress.
I’ve had less success trying to auto-post through Bridgy, but that’s at least partly on Bridgy’s side.

The support for Twitter, Flickr and micro.blog is solid. If you are updating your website with IndieWeb tech, this plugin is highly recommended.

This plugin is not perfect but is very useful and a great way of getting involved in the indieweb.

### [An awesome way to display links to copies of posts](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/an-awesome-way-to-display-links-to-copies-of-posts/)

[Chris Aldrich](https://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisaldrich/ "Posts by Chris Aldrich")
September 3, 2016

Almost everyone uses social media to publicize their WordPress posts. This is a dead-simple (and awesome) way to allow your WordPress installation to visually display where those copies of your posts went.
The fact that it integrates with some social tools (like Social Network Auto-Poster to automatically pull in those links) is even better.
