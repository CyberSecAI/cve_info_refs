## Description

WP Business Intelligence Lite allows you to powerfully display responsive data tables and charts on your website. This plugin is simple to use and allows you to connect with your wordpress database and display the data in real time. Once you have created at least one SQL query that retrieves data from your DB, you can define the type of chart (bar, donut, line, or grouped bar) or table to be used to display them. A simple shortcode embeds the chart or table in any post or page. Each page refresh retrieves the data from the DB so that the information in the chart or table is always up-to-date.

Installation guide, FAQs and support can be found at [WP Business Intelligence Support](http://www.wpbusinessintelligence.com/support)

I installed this plugin and it’s not work. I see error in any admin page of this plugin:
[Unknown column ‘library’ in ‘wpt\_wpbi\_grouped\_bar\_charts’]
ALTER TABLE wpt\_wpbi\_grouped\_bar\_charts ADD COLUMN in\_dash TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL AFTER library
For testing I install on new database after install Wordpress and nothing changed. I see the same errors..and because I can’t create any chart..nothing happens after create..

Being a long time user of the Lite version of this plugin, I find it very useful. I can generate beautiful responsive charts in my Wordpress wildlife website, from a custom table and parametrized for every post in our site. Best part of all this is the new development team, friendly, fast and efficient, solved a problem appeared in the last major revision pretty quickly. Happy user !

### [Problems Getting Fixed, Great Charts!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problems-getting-fixed-great-charts/)

As a long-time user of this plugin I had been dismayed with how it had eroded in recent years. A few months ago the developer and I reached an agreement for me to take over the plugin so my team and I could start making updates.
Since December of last year we have fixed all of the known bugs in the display of the charts, fixed the tooltip display, introduced more free charts for WP users, fixed a handful of database query bugs, added a feature to give your charts and graphs a name, added animation to all charts and graphs, and added a feature to give charts and graphs a caption.
This is only the beginning of our updates, but after 3 months of hardwork the issues with this plugin that were breaking reporting dashboards for us and our clients have now been fixed. We have an aggressive roadmap to bring more charts, features, and functionality to both the free and paid version of this plugin and I am excited to keep using it to build business intelligence dashboards and to display in-depth data on our clients websites.

I have been using the pre- 3.x version for a very long time (free version, but reached out to the developer and donated). Sadly, I have to say that version 3 is several steps backward… just to name a few points:
– no line charts anymore
– no names for charts, just IDs (which makes them hard to identify)
– very limited parameterization of charts and tables
– SQL column to small – need to create views for most queries.
– some charts do not appear at all, without any feedback / error message
– layout issues across the board – the more entities you have, the more issues with layout – it really is unusable for larger datasets
– bar charts with no tooltiptext
– …
I could continue for a while. With all this working in previous versions, I am really disappointed. It always feels bad when version-up reduces functionality.

After I installed the plugin and tried to activate it, WP crashed and I got the message –
“A catastrophic error has occurred such that WP Business Intelligence cannot run.”
