Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress.
*   Specifically, the issue arises when the third parameter passed to these functions is an **unescaped or untrusted URL**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URL Parameter Injection:** When an unescaped URL is passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or manipulate the URL.
*   **Unescaped URLs:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of the URL before it's used in these functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The blog post does not explicitly state the full impact of exploitation, but URL manipulation can lead to various attacks such as:
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to a malicious site.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the manipulated URL is displayed on the site, it could allow for injecting malicious scripts.
    *   **Other Malicious Actions:** Depending on the context of the URL and the application's logic, other attacks might be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the manipulation of URL parameters used by the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions. This would likely be done by crafting a malicious URL and tricking a user into clicking it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL, which would then be used by the vulnerable plugin.
*   They would need to entice a user to interact with this malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions that not all instances of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` are vulnerable. Only those where the 3rd parameter is an unescaped/untrusted URL.
*   The fix was deployed automatically for users who did not opt out of automatic updates.
*   The vulnerability was present in Easy Digital Downloads prior to the security fix.
