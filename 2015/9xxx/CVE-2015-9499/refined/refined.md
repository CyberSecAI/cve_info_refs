Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9499

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of authentication checks in the `showbiz_admin.php` file of the WordPress ShowBiz Pro plugin. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access administrative functions. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the plugin's update mechanism, where it fails to properly validate the uploaded update file, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious ZIP archive containing a PHP webshell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows uploading arbitrary files via a ZIP archive under the guise of a plugin update.
- **Missing Authentication:**  The plugin's AJAX actions are vulnerable due to missing authentication checks.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **Insecure Update Mechanism:** The plugin lacks proper validation and sanitization of uploaded ZIP archives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining control of the WordPress site.
- **Complete Site Compromise:** Attackers could gain access to the database, modify website content, and potentially compromise other parts of the system.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised WordPress instance and the server.
- **Malware Injection:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to inject malware and redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious payload is sent as a multipart form data request, simulating a plugin update.
- **ZIP Archive:** A malicious PHP file is embedded within a ZIP archive that is then uploaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Vulnerable Plugin:** The target WordPress site must have the vulnerable version of the ShowBiz Pro plugin installed (version 1.7.1 or earlier).

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a Perl script (morxrevbiz.pl) which demonstrates the exploit, showcasing how to upload the malicious ZIP file and execute the embedded PHP shell.
- It mentions that the same vulnerability was previously found in the Slider Revolution plugin and that ThemePunch did not issue a full security advisory for that patch.
- It emphasizes the critical nature of the vulnerability due to the potential to gain shell access, allowing for complete database access.
- The advisory recommends immediate upgrades or disabling/switching to another plugin.
