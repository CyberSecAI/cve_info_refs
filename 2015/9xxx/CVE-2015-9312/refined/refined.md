The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "NewStatPress" and mentions several security fixes in its changelog. Specifically, version 1.0.5 addresses a critical security update.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability existed in the handling of IMG tags. This suggests a flaw in how the plugin processes or renders HTML content, potentially related to user input.
- The plugin was vulnerable to both XSS and SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS attacks through the IMG tag. This likely means that user-supplied data, such as in the referrer field, was not properly sanitized before being displayed in the context of a web page.
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The plugin was also susceptible to SQL injection via the IMG tag. This means that specially crafted data, possibly within HTML attributes, could be used to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page that could be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, phishing attacks, or defacement of the website.
- **SQLI:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector was through the IMG tag, which indicates that an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into fields where image URLs or HTML attributes are processed by the plugin. This could include user agent strings, referrers or other input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious data that would be processed by the vulnerable IMG tag handling routines of the plugin. This could be done, for example, by manipulating the referrer header of an HTTP request or through crafted HTML in an input field, if the plugin allows it. No special privileges on the target system seem necessary.
