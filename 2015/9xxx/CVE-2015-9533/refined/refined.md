Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability discussed:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions within the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Specifically, when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows for manipulation of URLs, potentially injecting malicious code or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize or validate URLs before using them in the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Phishing:** This could be used to conduct phishing attacks.
- **Malware distribution:**  Attackers can distribute malware by redirecting users to malicious sites that host malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL with the intention of exploiting the vulnerability through the vulnerable plugin's functions.
- **Unsanitized User Input:** If the plugin uses user input to create the vulnerable URLs, the attack vector could come through the plugin itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate URLs that are processed by the vulnerable functions of the plugin. This could be through crafting a malicious URL or through some means of injecting malicious data into the plugin that is used in the construction of the URL.

**Additional details:**
- The comments in the article reveal that the vulnerability is not present in all cases of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` usage. It's only triggered when the 3rd parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL.
- The plugin developers addressed the vulnerability with an automatic update, suggesting it was a widespread issue and it was necessary to deploy a fix quickly.
