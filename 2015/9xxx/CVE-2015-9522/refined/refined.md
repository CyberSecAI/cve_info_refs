The provided content is a blog post about a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads (EDD). It includes comments related to the security issue but lacks a clear description of the vulnerability itself.

Based on the comments, the vulnerability seems related to the usage of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.

Specifically, the vulnerability arises when the 3rd parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of URLs used in `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- Specifically, the third parameter to these functions must be properly escaped, if it comes from an untrusted source.

**Impact:**
- The content does not specify the exact impact but, based on the description of the vulnerability, it is likely a cross-site scripting (XSS) or a URL redirection attack. An attacker could craft a malicious URL and potentially redirect users to a malicious site or perform other malicious actions in the context of a vulnerable site.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to find a location where an untrusted URL is passed as the third parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` within Easy Digital Downloads.
- An attacker could then inject a malicious URL into the application through that vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or control a URL that is then used in `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` calls without proper sanitization.

The blog post mentions that the security fix was deployed automatically and that users who haven't opted out of automatic updates should already have the fix.
