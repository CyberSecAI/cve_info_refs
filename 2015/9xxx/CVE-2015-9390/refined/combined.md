## Description

As a whole, the new WordPress Admin panel is organized fairly well, however when it comes to editing posts or pages quickly without having to open each post or page in a new tab or window, it isn’t a very efficient process. For those who are using **WordPress as a CMS**, it’s important to be able to manage contents easily and quickly. That’s what this plugin helps to do.

It adds some icons to the posts/pages management panel with **AJAX-driven** CMS-known functions like toggling post/page visibility, changing publication date and title **without having to open the edit screens or reload the page**, **plus changing page order with drag’n’drop**, inline category management and inline tag management, plus much more.

#### Licence

This plugins is released under the GPL, you can use it free of charge on your personal or commercial blog.

#### Notes on changing page order via Drag’n’Drop

Since Version 1.0 it is possible to change page order via drag’n’drop. Currently it’s only possible to drag top level pages, that means only those pages with no parent pages. It is planned to make it possible for child pages, though.

## FAQ

### Why cant I set the time with the inline calendar?

Well, show me a neat jQuery calendar plugin that can entirely be localized and that offers time settings, and it’ll propably find its way into the plugin. 😉

### Why isn’t this or that implemented to improve the admin interface?

If you have suggestions please let me know by dropping me a line via e-mail or the wp.org forums.

Direct Input is not working. No cursor in edit box when attempting to change page name.
must double click inside text box to edit. Not intuitive.

Would it be possible to date posts prior to 2000 ?
Maybe I shouldn’t do like this but I am making a site for a painter and wanted to date each post with the artwork’s date (the painting). I still can use the default Quick edit mode of WordPress
Thank you.

This plugin worked perfectly for bulk editing the page order fields. I had 190 pages to reorder and it was so easy to do with this.
Thank you!
