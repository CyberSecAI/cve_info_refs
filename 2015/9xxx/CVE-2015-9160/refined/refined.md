      "cve": "CVE-2015-9160",
      "references": [
        "A-37546254"
      ],
      "type": "N/A",
      "severity": "High",
       "component": "Closed-source component",
      "root_cause": "The provided text does not contain specific details regarding the root cause of this vulnerability. It only indicates that it resides within a Qualcomm closed-source component.",
      "weaknesses": "The specific weakness is not described within the provided text. However, the mention of 'closed-source component' suggests a lack of transparency and potential difficulty in identifying the vulnerability without access to the source code.",
      "impact": "The impact is not detailed. However, the 'High' severity suggests the vulnerability can be exploited for significant harm, such as unauthorized access, data manipulation, or service disruption. The potential impact of exploiting closed-source components is also mentioned as being critical.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is not explicitly stated, however given that the component is closed source, it can be assumed that the attacker needs to be running malicious code on the device or within the same environment. The mention of 'proximate attacker' in other CVEs in the document suggests the attacker may need to be physically close or within a local network, or it could mean the vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malformed packet or file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The capabilities needed are not specified, but given the impact, the attacker needs to have some ability to inject data into a closed source component, or execute some form of malicious code within the affected component."
