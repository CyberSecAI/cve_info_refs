Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's vhost driver, specifically how it handles file descriptors provided by userspace via the `VHOST_SET_LOG_FD` ioctl command. The driver fails to properly release these file descriptors, causing a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Descriptor Leak:** The vhost driver allocates but does not deallocate file descriptors, leading to a file descriptor leak.
- **Memory Consumption:**  The leaked file descriptors consume kernel memory, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Missing Resource Management:** The core issue is the lack of proper resource management when handling file descriptors received from userspace via the `VHOST_SET_LOG_FD` ioctl command

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** A privileged local user with access to `/dev/vhost-net` can repeatedly call `VHOST_SET_LOG_FD`, leaking file descriptors and consuming kernel memory. This can lead to a denial of service by exhausting available system resources (memory consumption), potentially causing a system hang or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A privileged local user.
- Access to `/dev/vhost-net` files either directly or through virtualization layers like libvirt.
- Using the `VHOST_SET_LOG_FD` ioctl to leak file descriptors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of privileged access on the local system to interact with the `/dev/vhost-net` device. This includes having the ability to directly use ioctl, or use virtualization management tools that access the vhost device.

**Additional Notes**
- Several sources mention that the issue is rated as "low" or "moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability is present in various Linux kernel versions (including those used by Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and SUSE).
- An upstream patch is available to fix this vulnerability.

The content from Red Hat bugzilla mentions:
"This issue does not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue has been rated as having Low impact, affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 and is currently not planned to be addressed in a future updates."

The SUSE security advisory specifies that this issue was addressed in various SUSE products through package updates, and provides a detailed list of affected versions and corresponding fixes.

The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3364-1 describes the issue as a potential cause of denial of service (hang or crash).
It was also noted that a fix is available in the stable distribution (jessie).

The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2749-1 and USN-2751-1 also identify the vulnerability and detail affected package versions for Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, and they highlight it as a potential cause of resource exhaustion leading to DoS.

The fix for the vulnerability is available in the kernel source tree on git.kernel.org.
