  "cve": "CVE-2015-6031",
  "description": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the XML parser functionality of the MiniUPnP library. A specially crafted XML response can lead to a buffer overflow on the stack resulting in remote code execution. An attacker can set up a server on the local network to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "< 2.0.20170509",
    "< 1.9.20150917"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "version 1.9.20150917",
    ">= 2.0.20170509"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unsafe memcpy call within the `IGDstartelt` function when parsing a new XML element. The size of the copy is determined by an externally controlled length argument, `l`, which is not checked against the destination buffer size `MINIUPNPC_URL_MAXSIZE` before the copy operation. This allows a malicious actor to overwrite memory on the stack by providing an oversized XML element name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Unsafe use of memcpy",
      "Lack of bounds checking on external input"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker sets up a malicious UPNP server on the local network, which sends specially crafted XML responses to a vulnerable client application during network discovery.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim. They need to be able to set up a malicious UPNP server and send crafted responses during the applicationâ€™s network discovery phase."
