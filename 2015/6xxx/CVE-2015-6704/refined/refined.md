Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the handling of the "animations" property in Adobe Reader DC. Specifically, when this property is called as a function, it returns excessive values in the error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of memory layout information through the error message when the "animations" property is called as a function.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The application fails to handle the error condition gracefully, leading to the disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain knowledge of the memory layout of the vulnerable Adobe Reader DC installation. This information, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code within the context of the process. This means the attacker could gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs some form of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. This is achieved by:
    *   Luring the user to visit a malicious page.
    *   Tricking the user into opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage or craft a malicious PDF document.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to either visit the malicious webpage or open the crafted malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri and Jasiel Spelman of HP Zero Day Initiative.
*   Adobe released an update to address this vulnerability, along with several others, on October 13, 2015, as detailed in bulletin APSB15-24.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected by a filter identified as '20843'.

In summary, CVE-2015-6704 is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by an error in handling the animations property, which could aid an attacker in further compromising the system when combined with other exploits.
