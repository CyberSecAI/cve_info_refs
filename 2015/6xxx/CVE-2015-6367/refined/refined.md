Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Secure Shell Version 2 (SSHv2) protocol implementation on Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is related to how the device handles SSHv2 connections which allows accumulation of connections leading to high CPU usage.
-  CWE-399: Resource Management Errors which can lead to denial of service by exhausting resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This DoS is caused by high CPU utilization and the accumulation of SSHv2 connections, which can render the access point unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network.
- The attacker does not need any specific credentials or prior access to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Point devices running Release 8.1(131.0).
- The advisory suggests using the `show proc cpu` command to check for high CPU usage and an accumulation of *-cisco_shell* processes to identify exploitation.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability, requiring a software update to fix the issue.
- The provided CVSS score is Base 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) and Temporal 4.8 (E:F/RL:U/RC:C).
