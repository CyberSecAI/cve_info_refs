Original Release Date: 2015-10-13 | Last Revised: 2015-10-29

---

### Overview

Several models of ZyXEL routers are vulnerable to multiple issues, including weak default passwords, command injections due to improper input validation, and cross-site scripting.

### Description

| [**CWE-255**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html)**: Credentials Management -** CVE-2015-6016  According to the reporter, the following models contain the weak default password of "1234" for the admin account:     + the ZyXEL P-660HW-T1 v2 with ZyNOS firmware version: V3.40(AXH.0) (dated 3/30/2007) + the ZyXEL PMG5318-B20A, firmware version V100AANC0b5 + the ZyXEL NBG-418N  [Many more models](https://default-password.info/zyxel/) have been reported to share this same password.[**CWE-80**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)** - CVE-2015-6017According to the reporter, a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability exists in the LoginPassword and hiddenPassword parameters of the /Forms/rpAuth\_1 page on the ZyXEL P-660HW-T1 v2 with ZyNOS firmware version: V3.40(AXH.0) (dated 3/30/2007).[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation** - CVE-2015-6018According to the reporter, the diagnostic ping function's PingIPAddr parameter in the ZyXEL PMG5318-B20A, firmware version V100AANC0b5, does not properly validate user input. An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands as root.[**CWE-613**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html)**: Insufficient Session Expiration** - CVE-2015-6019According to the reporter, the ZyXEL PMG5318-B20A, firmware version V100AANC0b5 does not properly expire the session when a user logs out of the management portal. The reporter has confirmed the session remains active for at least 1 hour after log off. An attacker may be able to utilize session information to gain access to the device even after the user has logged off.[**CWE-285**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)**: Improper Authorization** - CVE-2015-6020According to the reporter, the regular user account on the ZyXEL PMG5318-B20A, firmware version V100AANC0b5 has full administrative access, rather than restricted access. |
