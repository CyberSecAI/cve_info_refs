- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak default password
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The admin account for multiple ZyXEL router models uses the default password "1234".
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker could gain access to the device's management interface and modify system configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the device's network. They do not need to be authenticated if the default password is still in use.
