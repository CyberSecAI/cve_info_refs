Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Unauthorized Access:** The primary weakness is that the web interface allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to make limited configuration changes. This indicates a lack of proper access controls and authentication mechanisms.
- **CWE-264:** The advisory references CWE-264 which is "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls". This means the vulnerability stems from insufficient access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform limited configuration changes. The exact nature of these changes is not detailed, but it is implied that the changes could negatively impact the system/service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based Attack:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a network connection.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco Prime Service Catalog system and does not need to be authenticated
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted requests to the web interface.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or credentials.

**CVSS Score Details**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 6.5 and a Temporal Score of 6.2:
    - AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:U/RC:C
    - **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    - **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low) - The attack does not require any special conditions or access.
    - **Au:S** (Authentication: Single) -  The provided information contradicts the Au vector as it is stated that the attacker does not need to be authenticated. However, the vector uses the CVSS v2 metrics and this value is not appropriate.  Based on the description Au:N (None) should be used.
    - **C:P** (Confidentiality Impact: Partial) - There is some impact on confidentiality but not a complete compromise
    - **I:P** (Integrity Impact: Partial) - There is some impact on integrity but not a complete compromise
    - **A:P** (Availability Impact: Partial) - There is some impact on availability but not a complete compromise
    - **E:F** (Exploitability: Functional) - Functional exploit code is available.
    - **RL:U** (Remediation Level: Unavailable) - There is no solution available.
    - **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed) - The vulnerability has been confirmed.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Prime Service Catalog versions 10.0(R2), 10.0, 10.1, and 11.0 are vulnerable.
