**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=506

We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the win32k.sys driver while processing a specific corrupted TTF font file. The cleanest stack trace we have acquired, which might also indicate where the pool corruption takes place and/or the root cause of the vulnerability, is shown below:

---
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
is pointing at freed memory.
Arguments:
Arg1: fffff900c4c31000, memory referenced.
Arg2: 0000000000000001, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
Arg3: fffff96000156a34, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
	address.
Arg4: 0000000000000000, (reserved)

We have also observed a number of other system bugchecks caused by the particular TTF file with various stack traces indicating a pool corruption condition. For example, on Windows 7 32-bit a crash occurs only while deleting the font, under the following call stack:

---

While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, we have pinpointed the offending mutations to reside in the "OS/2" table.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 (32 and 64-bit). It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it it also possible to observe a system crash on a default Windows installation as a consequence of pool corruption and resulting system instability. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided sample, it might be necessary to use a custom program which displays all of the font's glyphs at various point sizes.

Attached is an archive with the proof-of-concept mutated TTF file, together with the original font used to generate it and a corresponding kernel crash log from Windows 7 64-bit.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Security Update for Microsoft Windows to Address Remote Code Execution (3105864)

Published: November 10, 2015 | Updated: April 7, 2016

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded fonts.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Windows handles objects in memory
* Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows handles embedded fonts
* Windows Kernel validates certain permissions

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Kernel Memory Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the way that Windows handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the target system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory.

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

## Multiple Windows Kernel Memory Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when Windows fails to properly initialize memory addresses, allowing an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could retrieve the base address of the Kernel driver from a compromised process.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows handles memory addresses.

## Multiple Windows Graphics Memory Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when the Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are several ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded fonts. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows handles embedded fonts.
