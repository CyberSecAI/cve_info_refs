  "CVE-2015-6103": {
    "Description": "This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded fonts.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows improperly handling specially crafted embedded fonts, specifically a malformed OS/2 table within the TrueType Font (TTF) file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of embedded fonts",
      "Pool-based buffer overflow in win32k.sys during TTF font processing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow remote code execution. An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted document containing the malicious font.",
      "Visiting an untrusted webpage with embedded malicious fonts."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted TTF font file with a malformed OS/2 table and host this file in a document or webpage. The attacker must also convince the victim to open the document or webpage.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be triggered when displaying a font's glyphs at various point sizes or during font deletion. The vulnerability is reproducible on Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit) and other affected systems. Special Pools can be enabled for win32k.sys to cause an immediate crash when the bug is triggered, but the vulnerability can also be triggered on a default Windows installation through pool corruption and system instability."
