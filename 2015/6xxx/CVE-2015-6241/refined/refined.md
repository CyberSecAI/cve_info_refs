  "CVE-2015-6241": {
    "Description": "The proto_tree_add_bytes_item function in epan/proto.c in the protocol-tree implementation in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not properly terminate a data structure after a failure to locate a number within a string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.",
    "Root cause": "Improper termination of a data structure in `proto_tree_add_bytes_item` after failing to locate a number within a string.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of errors during data structure modification.",
      "Lack of proper resource management during packet dissection."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted network packets."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send crafted network packets.",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerability to create a packet that triggers it."
    ],
        "Additional Information": "This vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."

    "Description": "The wmem_block_split_free_chunk function in epan/wmem/wmem_allocator_block.c in the wmem block allocator in the memory manager in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not properly consider a certain case of multiple realloc operations that restore a memory chunk to its original size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect free operation and application crash) via a crafted packet.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of memory chunk reallocations that restore a chunk to its original size in `wmem_block_split_free_chunk`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management during reallocations.",

    "Description": "The dissector-table implementation in epan/packet.c in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 mishandles table searches for empty strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet, related to the (1) dissector_get_string_handle and (2) dissector_get_default_string_handle functions.",
    "Root cause": "Mishandling of table searches for empty strings in the dissector-table implementation, specifically related to `dissector_get_string_handle` and `dissector_get_default_string_handle` functions.",

    "Description": "The dissect_zbee_secure function in epan/dissectors/packet-zbee-security.c in the ZigBee dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 improperly relies on length fields contained in packet data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.",
