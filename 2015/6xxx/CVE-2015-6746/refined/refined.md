{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software, including hard-coded credentials, client-side access control, unprotected storage of private keys, and plain text SQL server communications.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Hard-coded account credentials used for account management.",
    "Client-side access control and auditing allowing bypass of security mechanisms.",
    "Unprotected storage of private keys used for banking transactions, stored in plain text or trivially protected in the SQL database.",
    "Plain text communication between client and SQL server without tamper protection.",
    "Lack of replay protection.",
	"Bypass of permission restrictions (access controls)."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could duplicate digital banking security keys, modify records, bypass access controls, modify banking/payment information, access bank account encryption keys, and impersonate authorized users to the banks to perform fraudulent transactions, leading to financial loss and unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Network traffic interception (man-in-the-middle) to modify data between client and server.",
    "Direct access to the SQL database to retrieve private keys and user data.",
	"Exploitation of client side access control.",
	"Replaying captured client to server communication to gain access."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic.",
    "Access to the SQL database where the software is installed.",
	"Local access to software's client"
  ]
