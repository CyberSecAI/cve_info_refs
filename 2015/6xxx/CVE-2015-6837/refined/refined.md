Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-6837:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3358-1) and the Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201606-10) both explicitly list CVE-2015-6837 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in PHP.
   - The php bug tracker at bugs.php.net also confirms this CVE being assigned to Bug #69782.
   - All sources indicate that this CVE is associated with a vulnerability in PHP.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is described in the php bug tracker as a **NULL pointer dereference** in the `XSLTProcessor` class.
   - Specifically, the `valuePop()` function (part of libxslt) can return a NULL pointer, and PHP was missing checks to handle this scenario in `xsltprocessor.c` (lines 304-305 and 239-240).
    -  The missing checks on the input from the libxslt library.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is the lack of NULL pointer checks after a call to `valuePop()`. This lack of validation leads to a dereference of a NULL pointer and a subsequent crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - The immediate impact is a **segmentation fault** or crash of the PHP process, leading to a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.
   - The Gentoo advisory also mentions the possibility of **arbitrary code execution**, although the provided details don't directly detail how this is achieved. Further research into libxslt and related vulnerabilities could provide more information about this potential.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector involves using the `XSLTProcessor` class and causing `valuePop()` to return a NULL pointer through a specially crafted XSLT transformation.
   -  The code in `xsltprocessor.c` is vulnerable to the use of  a specially crafted XSLT transformation that leads to a return of NULL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - An attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious XSLT stylesheet to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `XSLTProcessor` class.
   - The attacker would likely need to be able to control the input of the XSLT transformation process.

**Technical details and descriptions:**

-  The `valuePop()` function call able to return with NULL pointer.

-  These checks missed in `xsltprocessor.c` lines 304-305 and on lines 239-240 in the same function.
  - <http://lxr.php.net/xref/PHP_5_6/ext/xsl/xsltprocessor.c#305>

-  Reproducing the issue:
```
$ php -f xpath.php
Warning: XSLTProcessor::transformToXml(): xmlXPathCompOpEval: function d not found in xpath.php on line 31
Warning: XSLTProcessor::transformToXml(): Unregistered function in xpath.php on line 31
Warning: XSLTProcessor::transformToXml(): Stack usage errror in xpath.php on line 31
Segmentation fault
```

-  The issue was assigned with two CVEs: CVE-2015-6837 and CVE-2015-6838. Details at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/524>

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-6837 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the PHP `XSLTProcessor` class.  By using a specially crafted XSLT transformation, an attacker could cause `valuePop()` to return a NULL pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial-of-service. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely as user input can influence the XSLT transformation. While the provided text does not explicitly describe how arbitrary code execution is achieved, this possibility is mentioned in the Gentoo advisory, suggesting further research might uncover additional exploitation vectors.
