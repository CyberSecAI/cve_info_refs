Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) filter bypass in Microsoft Edge.
- The XSS filter incorrectly disables an HTML attribute in filtered HTTP response data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Filter Bypass:** The primary weakness is the failure of the XSS filter to properly sanitize or handle HTML attributes, leading to the ability to bypass the filter.
- **Improperly Disabled HTML Attributes:** The incorrect disabling of HTML attributes creates a condition where initially blocked scripts can execute in an unintended security context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The bypass can lead to information disclosure due to the ability to run malicious scripts in the wrong security context.
- **Script Execution in User Context:** An attacker can cause script to run on another user's system within the context of a third-party website.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary scripts can potentially lead to privilege escalation depending on the actions the script performs and the permissions the user has within the affected website.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The malicious script could potentially perform any action on the user's system that the third-party website is permitted to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Content:** An attacker creates specially crafted content designed to exploit the filter bypass.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to convince the user to view the content on an affected website.
- **Hyperlink/Browsing:** Exploitation requires the user to either click a hyperlink in an HTML email or visit an attacker-controlled website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website/Content Control:** The attacker needs to be able to post content on a website or control a website visited by the target user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to lure the user into interacting with the malicious content.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the target user's browser over the network.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the XSS filter in Microsoft Edge to correctly handle HTML attributes.
- At the time of the bulletin's release, there was no indication that the bypass was being used in active attacks.
- Workstations and terminal servers are considered at higher risk due to the frequent use of Microsoft Edge.
