Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6371

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in a user script included with Cisco Firepower 9000 devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The user script has insufficient access control allowing an authenticated, remote attacker to view any file on the device, even those that should be restricted.
- CWE-200: Information Exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the affected device, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.
- The impact is a breach of confidentiality, as indicated by the CVSS vector's "C:P" (Partial Confidentiality Impact).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated. The CVSS vector "Au:S" (Single Authentication) confirms this.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges beyond authentication, and can exploit the vulnerability without local access.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is due to an insecure user script in Cisco Firepower 9000 devices that allows a remote, authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
