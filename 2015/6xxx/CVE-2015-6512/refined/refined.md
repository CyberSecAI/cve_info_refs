Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6512
*   **Vulnerable Software:** FreiChat 9.6
*  **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['time']` parameter in the `freichat/server/plugins/chatroom/chatroom.php` file.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being directly included in a SQL query. Specifically, the `$time` variable from `$_GET['time']` is used without escaping in the SQL query within the `get_messages` function.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `freichat/server/freichat.php` endpoint when the `freimode` is set to `loadchatroom`, and a malicious `time` parameter is included.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `time` parameter. No special privileges within the application are required.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, as demonstrated by the provided proof of concept that aims to extract the WordPress admin password.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data in the database, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject SQL by crafting a malicious `time` parameter, leveraging a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `wp_users` table.
*   **More Detail Than CVE:** Yes, the provided content gives significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing the vulnerable code, a proof-of-concept exploit, and the exact attack vector.

In summary, this is a classic SQL injection vulnerability caused by a lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and extract sensitive information.
