Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding **CVE-2015-6059**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from JScript and VBScript improperly disclosing the contents of their memory. Specifically, certain functions do not handle objects in memory properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory disclosure within the JScript and VBScript scripting engines. This can provide an attacker with sensitive memory contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could leverage the disclosed memory information to further compromise a user's computer or data. This information could be used to facilitate other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to know the memory address where the vulnerable object was created to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute or trigger JScript/VBScript code in the victim's environment. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious website, using a compromised website, or via an application or document using the IE rendering engine. They need to have knowledge about the memory address of the vulnerable objects to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how certain functions in the scripting engines handle objects in memory.
- This vulnerability is categorized as "Important" in severity.
- There were no identified mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of scripting engine vulnerabilities that were addressed in the MS15-108 security bulletin.
-  The vulnerability is addressed in MS15-106 for Internet Explorer 8 and later, and MS15-108 for Internet Explorer 7 and earlier.
