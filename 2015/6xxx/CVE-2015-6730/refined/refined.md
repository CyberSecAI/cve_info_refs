Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize error messages in MediaWiki's `thumb.php` file. Specifically, parameters pulled from client requests were not validated or sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting malicious code into the error messages, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
  - Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
  - Redirect the victim to malicious websites.
  - Perform actions on the user's behalf.
  - Deface the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs that include unsanitized error messages parameters that are then reflected back in the page's HTML.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or redirecting them to a page containing the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious content embedded in the error message parameters.
- The attacker needs to get the victim to load that malicious URL via a crafted link or redirection.

**Additional Information:**

- The CVE was assigned to the internal XSS discoveries, as there was a distinction made in assignment from the original report of John Menerick that led to CVE-2015-6729.

The provided information gives a good overview of the XSS vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
