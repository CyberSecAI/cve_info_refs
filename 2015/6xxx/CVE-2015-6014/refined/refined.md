Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6014

**Description:**
This CVE refers to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the Oracle Outside In Technology library, specifically affecting the parsing of DOC files. This is one of three similar vulnerabilities affecting WK4, Doc and Paradox DB files.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow within the Oracle Outside In library when parsing DOC files. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling data within the DOC file format, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable library.
* System compromise: Depending on the privileges of the vulnerable application, exploitation could lead to full system compromise.
* No user interaction may be required: In some cases, the vulnerable code can be triggered without any user action.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Malicious file: The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious DOC file designed to trigger the overflow.
* Remote exploitation: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
* Unauthenticated: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* Ability to craft a malicious DOC file
* Ability to send the crafted file to a vulnerable application, or have the vulnerable application process the crafted file.
* No user interaction may be required for successful exploit, but some user actions (i.e. clicking/previewing a file) may be enough to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects Oracle Outside In Technology versions 8.5.2 and earlier.
*   Numerous products from various vendors utilize the Oracle Outside In library, potentially exposing a wide range of software to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by the Oracle Critical Patch Update released in January 2016.
*   The provided document mentions that the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) could be used to mitigate the vulnerability.
