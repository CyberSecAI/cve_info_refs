Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6289

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software handle remote TCP connections. Specifically, there's an issue that can lead to low memory conditions when processing these connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper handling of remote TCP connections.
*   Memory exhaustion due to the flawed handling of connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Partial Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The device becomes unresponsive due to low memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote attacker.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited over the network using TCP connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Unauthenticated access to the affected device.
*   Ability to send TCP connections to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending network traffic to the affected devices.
*   No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   The initial advisory mentioned SSH but was later generalized to all TCP connections as the root cause was not limited to SSH.
