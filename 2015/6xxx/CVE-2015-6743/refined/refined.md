Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple insecure design and implementation choices within the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software, specifically:

1.  **Hard-coded account:** The software uses a hard-coded account ("ANCO" or similar) with a static password for account management tasks. Although this was changed in later versions, a different hard-coded account with a static password can be used to find the management account credentials.
2.  **Client-side access control:** The software relies on the client-side to enforce access controls, audit trails, and account locking.
3.  **Unprotected storage of private keys:** The private keys used for banking transactions are stored in plain text (or trivially protected) within the SQL database, accessible to all users of the software, even if access control policies are set to restrict access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded credentials:** The use of a hard-coded account and password for account management exposes the system to unauthorized access.
*   **Insufficient access control:** Client-side checks for access control, auditing and account locking are easily bypassed, allowing attackers to manipulate the system.
*   **Plaintext storage of sensitive information:** Storing private keys used for banking transactions in plaintext or with weak encryption exposes them to unauthorized access and misuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Financial theft:** Attackers can use the stolen private keys to make fraudulent transactions.
*   **Data modification:** Attackers can modify transaction records, pending transactions, and account balances within the software, creating undetectable economic crimes.
*   **Bypassing access control:** Attackers can bypass permission restrictions, giving them complete control over the system.
*   **Account compromise:** An attacker can lock or unlock user accounts, and modify audit trails.
*   **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate the software or an authorized account holder to various online banking systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to the database:** Exploitation requires access to the SQL database where the private keys are stored.
*   **Network access:** Man-in-the-middle attacks can intercept plaintext communication between the client and server, allowing manipulation of data and credentials.
*   **Client-side manipulation:** Attackers can disrupt or bypass security features by modifying client behavior.
*   **Replay attacks:** Attackers can reuse login messages to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Internal network access:** Attackers would need access to the internal network where the software is deployed.
*   **Database access:** Attackers would require access to the SQL database containing sensitive information.
*   **Man-in-the-middle position:** To perform a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker would need to be able to intercept communications between the client and server.
*   **Software access:** Attackers may be internal users with software access, or an external actor who has gained access.
