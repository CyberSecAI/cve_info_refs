- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from Silverlight's improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure vulnerability due to failure to properly handle objects in memory, leading to potentially predictable pointer values. This degrades the efficacy of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass ASLR, making the system more vulnerable to further attacks. This does not allow arbitrary code execution on its own but can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a website with specially crafted Silverlight content, or use compromised websites/websites that accept user-provided content with crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or interact with specially crafted content (e.g., clicking a link in an email).
