{
  "CVE-2015-6462": {
    "Root cause": "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can craft a specific URL containing JavaScript that will be executed on the client browser. This could lead to various malicious actions depending on the injected script (e.g., session hijacking, data theft, redirect to malicious sites).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when clicked by a user with HTTP access to the PLC web server, executes the injected JavaScript in the user's browser.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target PLC to craft the URL. Social engineering is required to convince a user with HTTP access to the PLC web server to click on the malicious link."
