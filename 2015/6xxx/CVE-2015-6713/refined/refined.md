Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6713

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `call` method of Function objects is handled within Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. By crafting a PDF with specific JavaScript instructions, it becomes possible to bypass the JavaScript API restrictions enforced by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- JavaScript API Restriction Bypass: The vulnerability allows an attacker to circumvent the intended security measures that restrict the capabilities of JavaScript code within the application's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF File: An attacker can embed the malicious JavaScript within a specially crafted PDF document.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker can host a web page containing malicious JavaScript that triggers the vulnerability when a user opens the PDF within the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Position: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, using the above-mentioned vectors.
- User Interaction: User interaction is required as the target must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page containing the PDF, or with JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability in Acrobat Reader.

**Additional Notes**
- The Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability using filter ID '20542'
- Adobe has released a patch for this vulnerability.
