Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root cause lies in the insecure design and implementation of the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software. This includes:

*   **Hard-coded accounts:**  The software uses a hard-coded account with a known password across all installations for account management tasks. Although this was changed in later versions, the hardcoded account credentials could still be discovered.
*   **Client-side access control:** Critical security functions like login verification, audit trails, and account locking are handled client-side, making them easily bypassed.
*   **Unprotected storage of private keys:** The software stores private keys used for banking transactions in plain text (or with trivial protection) in the SQL database.
*   **Plain text SQL communication:** Communication between the client and SQL server is done in plain text without tamper protection, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CVE-2015-0942:**
    *   **Hard-coded account:**  Use of static credentials for account management, present even after the vendor claimed the issue was resolved.
    *   **Client-side access control:** Bypassing login verification, audit trails, and account locking by manipulating client-side functions. Users can also remove their own account locks due to it being client-side.
    *   **Private key exposure:** Private keys used for banking transactions are stored unprotected in the database, available to all users.
*   **CVE-2015-0943:**
    *   **Plaintext communication:** Lack of encryption and tamper protection in SQL server communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **Financial theft:** Attackers can use exposed private keys to impersonate authorized users and make fraudulent banking transactions.
*   **Data manipulation:** Modification of all records in the software, including transaction records and pending transactions, leading to financial and accounting discrepancies.
*   **Bypassing security controls:** Attackers can bypass access controls and permission restrictions in the client software.
*   **Undetectable economic crimes:** Actions performed through exploitation are difficult to detect.
*   **Full compromise of banking systems:** Man-in-the-middle attacks or access to packet captures can expose sensitive banking information, user credentials, and encryption keys, allowing complete control over banking processes.
*   **Replay attacks:** Captured login messages can be replayed to gain unauthorized server access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:**
    *   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks:** Intercepting and manipulating communications between the client and server to modify banking information and gain access to credentials and encryption keys (for CVE-2015-0943).
    *   **Packet capture:** Intercepting network traffic to reveal sensitive banking data, user credentials, and encryption keys (for CVE-2015-0943).
    *   **Replay attacks:** Reusing captured login messages to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Local Access:**
    *   **Direct SQL access:** Exploiting hardcoded or exposed credentials to gain access to the SQL database and manipulate stored data.
    *   **Client-side manipulation:** Interfering with the client-side application, using the hardcoded user to bypass access controls, and removing account locks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** Ability to intercept network traffic within the same network as the vulnerable software installation (for MitM or packet capture attacks).
*   **Access to the client software:** To use the application and manipulate the client-side security features, or to access local database.
*   **Knowledge of SQL commands** To directly interact with the database.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The software is used by around 1,500 to 2,000 organizations mainly in the Nordic and Baltic regions.
*   The report provides detailed timeline of events, communication with the vendor, and actions taken by CERT-FI, which shows the vendor's lack of action to resolve these issues promptly.
*   The report emphasizes that despite vendor claims of fixes, the vulnerabilities were still present at the time of publishing this report.
*   The report was made public on July 28, 2015, due to unresolved issues and lack of proper fixes by the vendor.
