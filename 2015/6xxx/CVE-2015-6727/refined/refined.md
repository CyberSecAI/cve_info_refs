Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Special:DeletedContributions` page in MediaWiki not properly concealing the IP address of autoblocked users. This exposed the IP address, where it should have been kept private. This is inconsistent with how `Special:Contributions` and `Special:BlockList` handled autoblocked IPs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the unintentional disclosure of autoblocked users' IP addresses. This allows an attacker to potentially identify users who have been automatically blocked by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of IP addresses constitutes a privacy violation for autoblocked users.
*   **Potential for Targeted Attacks:**  An attacker could potentially leverage this information to target specific users or groups, or gain insights into who is being autoblocked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Special:DeletedContributions:** An attacker could access the `Special:DeletedContributions` page. This vulnerability is exploitable by anyone with the ability to view the `Special:DeletedContributions` page, meaning no special privileges are required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Access:** The attacker only needs a web browser and access to the MediaWiki instance to view the `Special:DeletedContributions` page. No specific user role or authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Knowledge of autoblocked IPs:** The attacker would benefit from knowledge of a specific autoblocked user's IP to target, or they can look for patterns in the data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was addressed by modifying the `SpecialDeletedContributions.php` file to ensure that autoblocked IPs are not displayed, bringing the page's behavior in line with other similar MediaWiki pages.
*   The fix was implemented in MediaWiki versions 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25.
*   This was a similar issue as one resolved in 2013, but on a different special page.

This is an information leak vulnerability that does not require elevated privileges to exploit and has a low impact.
