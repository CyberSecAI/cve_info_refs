```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the file upload functionality in Wolf CMS's file manager plugin, which allows authenticated users with upload permissions to upload arbitrary files to the '/public' directory. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or restrict file types during the upload process.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Arbitrary file upload: The system allows users to upload any file type, including executable files like PHP scripts.
    - Lack of file type validation: The file manager does not properly check the file extension or content to prevent the upload of malicious files.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote code execution: By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
    - Website defacement: Attackers could upload files to deface the website.
    - Data exfiltration: Attackers could potentially use the access to upload files to exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the system
- Attack vectors:
    - Web interface: The file manager plugin's upload function is accessed through the web interface.
    - HTTP POST Request: The file upload is performed using a POST request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Authenticated user: The attacker needs a valid user account with access to the file manager's upload functionality.
    - Network access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the vulnerable Wolf CMS installation.
