- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in a web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to modify system configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability exists in the `LoginPassword` and `hiddenPassword` parameters of the `/Forms/rpAuth_1` page. An attacker could inject malicious script into these parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests containing the malicious script to the vulnerable web page.
