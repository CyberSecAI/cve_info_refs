Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-6620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the libstagefright library, specifically during the processing of media data. There is a vulnerability in `AMessage::FromParcel` related to the number of items, and when reading strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of crafted data within libstagefright when creating an AMessage from a Parcel. This includes insufficient checks on the number of items (`mNumItems`) and a lack of validation when reading strings using `readCString`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the mediaserver service. This leads to an elevation of privilege.
- The mediaserver service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges that third-party apps cannot normally access, which can lead to further attacks.
- Exploitation could grant an attacker elevated capabilities, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions which are not accessible to third party apps.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by a local malicious application that can interact with mediaserver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the mediaserver service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
- The fix involves adding checks for the incoming `mNumItems` and the return value of `readCString`
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 6.0 and below.
