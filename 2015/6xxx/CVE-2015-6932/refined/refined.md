- **Root cause of vulnerability:** VMware vCenter Server does not validate the certificate when connecting to a single sign-on identity source using LDAPS (LDAP over SSL). This occurs when connecting to Active Directory as an LDAP Server or OpenLDAP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper certificate validation when using LDAPS connections to an LDAP server for single sign-on identity sources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker capable of intercepting network traffic between vCenter Server and the LDAP server could capture sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting network traffic between vCenter Server and the LDAP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable vCenter server and the targeted LDAP server.
