Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the implementation of color objects in light objects. Specifically, the RGB values returned from a newly created light object can disclose the heap address of a color object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. By retrieving the RGB values of a newly created light object, an attacker can obtain the heap address of a color object. This address reveals memory layout information.
*   **Memory Leak:** The advisory from Adobe mentions a memory leak vulnerability with CVE-2015-6697.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain knowledge of the memory layout of the affected system.
*  **Code Execution:** This information, when used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, can potentially enable an attacker to execute code within the context of the process, as stated by ZDI.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. This could involve:
    *   Visiting a malicious web page.
    *   Opening a specially crafted malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require local access to the target machine.
*   **Ability to deliver malicious content:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver malicious content that can be rendered by the vulnerable Adobe software, either through a web page or a malicious file.
*   **Knowledge of other vulnerabilities:** To achieve code execution, the attacker needs to combine the leaked memory address with another vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
*   Adobe released a patch to address this vulnerability in October 2015.
