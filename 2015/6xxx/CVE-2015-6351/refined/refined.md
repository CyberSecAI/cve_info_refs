Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) input packet handler of the Cisco ASR 5500 System Architecture Evolution (SAE) Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of BGP input packets. Specifically, a flaw in the BGP input packet handler exists, leading to unexpected restarts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This occurs because the BGP process restarts unexpectedly, disrupting network services reliant on BGP.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted BGP packets to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco ASR 5500 SAE Gateway.
- The attacker must be able to generate and send the specific BGP packets that trigger the vulnerability.
