Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a security feature bypass that occurs due to how exceptions are handled when dispatching certain window messages in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. This improper exception handling allows an attacker to probe the layout of the address space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a security mechanism designed to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption bugs by randomizing the memory addresses of key system components. By probing the address space, the attacker can identify the locations of these components, negating the protection ASLR provides.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Enables further exploitation:** By itself, the ASLR bypass does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker can use this to facilitate other attacks, such as remote code execution by making it easier to exploit memory corruption bugs as memory locations become predictable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website that exploits this vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The user must visit a malicious site using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and trick the user into visiting it
- The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability to probe the address space.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer
- The fix for the vulnerability includes updating the browser and a manual step to enable the User32 Exception Handler Hardening Feature.
- The issue is described as an 'ASLR Bypass' in the security bulletin.
- The update modifies how the browsers handle exceptions when dispatching window messages to mitigate this issue.

**Mitigation:**
- For Internet Explorer users, in addition to the update, they must enable the "User32 Exception Handler Hardening Feature" through a Microsoft easy fix or a manual registry change.
- Users who do not enable the hardening feature remain vulnerable.
-  For Microsoft Edge users, applying the cumulative update is sufficient, along with enabling the User32 Exception Handler Hardening Feature.
