**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory within Microsoft Office, specifically when processing binary (.xlsb) Excel files.
- The target location for a branch is read from uninitialized memory due to a malformed .xlsb file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability
- Use of uninitialized memory

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Web-based attack: An attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website) containing a specially crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious .xlsb file to the victim.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to how Microsoft Excel handles binary (.xlsb) files.
- Microsoft released a security update to correct this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is categorized as a "Memory Corruption Vulnerability" and is associated with "Remote Code Execution".
