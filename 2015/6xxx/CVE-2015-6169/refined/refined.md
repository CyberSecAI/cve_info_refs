- The crafted website can spoof content or act as a pivot for further attacks by chaining with other web service vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User interaction required:** Exploitation requires the user to click on a specially crafted URL.
    - This could occur via a malicious link in an email, instant message, or other method of luring the user to interact with the crafted URL.
