The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in how Internet Explorer processes the `htmlFor` attribute of script elements. By manipulating document elements, an attacker can force a CElement-derived object to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of the `htmlFor` attribute in script elements, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker hosting a specially crafted webpage or file that exploits the vulnerability, which the user must then visit or open. Attackers can also leverage compromised websites to host the malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or file and convince the victim to interact with it. This interaction typically involves the victim visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file. User interaction is a required component for exploitation.
