Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of crafted URLs by Cisco TelePresence Server devices. Specifically, the issue is with how the devices handle URLs which can exhaust memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The software does not correctly process and sanitize incoming URL requests.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** Maliciously crafted URLs can cause the device to exhaust available memory resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the device reloading/restarting, effectively causing a denial of service. The device becomes unavailable for its intended function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any form of authentication.
*   **Crafted URLs:** The attack involves sending specifically crafted URLs to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco TelePresence Server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials to execute the attack.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to construct URLs that trigger the memory exhaustion.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco TelePresence Server software versions 4.1(2.29) through 4.2(4.17).
*   Specific log messages can indicate an attempted exploit, including "new incoming connection", "new incoming tx tunnel channel", and "failing incomplete connection".
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability in versions 4.2(3.72) and 4.2(4.18).
*   A Snort rule (38399) is available to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities fixed in the same timeframe in cisco-sa-20160406-cts and cisco-sa-20160406-cts2, concerning IPv6 and STUN packet handling, respectively.
