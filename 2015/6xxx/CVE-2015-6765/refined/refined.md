Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6765:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the AppCache implementation of the Chromium browser, specifically within the `content/browser/appcache/appcache_update_job.cc` file. It occurs due to incorrect pointer management during AppCache updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The vulnerability is a classic use-after-free, meaning that memory is accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser.
- Denial of service: The vulnerability can also be exploited to crash the browser leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker could create a specially crafted website that triggers the vulnerability when visited by a user using a vulnerable version of Chromium or a Chromium based browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to access a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific conditions that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is related to improper handling of AppCache update jobs, especially in scenarios involving duplicate cache selection.
- The fix involves addressing pointer maintenance in callbacks related to the AppCache.
- The fix is present in Chromium version 47.0.2526.73 and later.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Linux distributions as they ship with vulnerable chromium based browsers.
