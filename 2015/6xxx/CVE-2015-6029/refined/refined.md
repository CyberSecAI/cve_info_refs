Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper logging and lockout mechanisms for failed login attempts via the SOAP interface in HP ArcSight Logger.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts:** The system does not log or lockout accounts after repeated failed login attempts via the SOAP interface, unlike the standard web GUI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can attempt brute-force password guessing without triggering alerts or account lockouts, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, utilizing the SOAP interface of HP ArcSight Logger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the vulnerable SOAP interface. They do not need any prior authentication to start the attack. They must be able to make multiple attempts, as it is a brute force attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected version is ArcSight Logger 6.0.0.7307.1, and other versions may also be affected.
- This vulnerability is different from the other two (CVE-2015-2136 and CVE-2015-6030) mentioned in the same document.
