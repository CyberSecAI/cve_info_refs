## In this article

## Cumulative Security Update for JScript and VBScript to Address Remote Code Execution (3116178)

Published: December 8, 2015 | Updated: May 25, 2016

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the VBScript scripting engine in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker hosts a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer (or leverages a compromised website or a website that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convinces a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the Internet Explorer rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user and, if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the VBScript scripting engine on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **AffectedSoftware** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handle objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **VulnerabilityInformation** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3116178](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3116178).

## Affected Software

The following versions of VBScript are affected by the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. Earlier versions or editions that are not listed are either past their [support life cycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) or are not affected. The following affected software apply to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier installed and to systems without Internet Explorer installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply Internet Explorer Cumulative Update 3104002 ([MS15-124](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699422)), which also addresses the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Why do I see both JScript.dll and VBScript.dll in the packages for this cumulative security update?**

This security update ships as a cumulative update for the JScript and VBScript scripting engines. While both engines are included in this release, the components affected by the security fixes covered by this bulletin are listed above in the section **AffectedSoftware**.

**How do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the version of the JScript and VBScript scripting engine that are installed.

To determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. For VBScript, right-click **vbscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.

## Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6136

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the VBScript engine renders, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handle objects in memory.

## Cumulative Security Update for JScript and VBScript to Address Remote Code Execution (3116178)

Published: December 8, 2015 | Updated: May 25, 2016

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the VBScript scripting engine in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker hosts a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer (or leverages a compromised website or a website that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convinces a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the Internet Explorer rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user and, if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the VBScript scripting engine on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **AffectedSoftware** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handle objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **VulnerabilityInformation** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3116178](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3116178).

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3116180)

Published: December 8, 2015 | Updated: December 16, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer, VBScript, and certain functions handle objects in memory
* Preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes
* Helping to ensure that Internet Explorer properly enforces content types
* Helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3116180](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3116180).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Microsoft Browser XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerabilities

Multiple XSS filter bypass vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer disables an HTML attribute in otherwise appropriately filtered HTTP response data. The vulnerabilities could allow initially disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker could post on a website specially crafted content that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. The attacker would then have to convince the user to view the content on the affected website. If the user then browses to the website, the XSS filter disables HTML attributes in the specially crafted content, creating a condition that could allow malicious script to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could cause script to run on another user's system in the guise of a third-party website. Such script would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party website, and could take any action on the user's system that the third-party website was permitted to take. The vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the user clicked a hypertext link, either in an HTML email or if the user visited an attacker's website or a website containing content that is under the attackerâs control.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

## Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6136

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the VBScript engine renders when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handles objects in memory.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Browser Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6139

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce content types. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary script with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Internet Explorer properly enforces content types. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

## Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-6161

A security feature bypass for Internet Explorer exists as a result of how exceptions are handled when dispatching certain window messages, allowing an attacker to probe the layout of the address space and thereby bypassing [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx). By itself, the ASLR bypass does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code on a target system. Successful exploitation of the ASLR bypass requires a user to be logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. The user would then need to browse to a malicious site.

## Internet Explorer XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6164

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to access information from one domain and inject it into another domain.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit this vulnerability to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-6164](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6164). At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
