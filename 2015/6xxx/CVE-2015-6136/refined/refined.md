Based on the provided content, CVE-2015-6136 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the VBScript engine that can lead to information disclosure and potentially remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of objects in memory by the VBScript engine when processing specific functions like `InStrB`, `InStr`, `InStrRev`, `Filter`, `Join`, `StrComp`, and `Replace`. By providing specially crafted parameters to these functions, an attacker can trigger a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the VBScript engine.
- Improper handling of objects in memory by specific VBScript functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary memory, potentially revealing sensitive information. This information can be used to bypass ASLR and other security protections to facilitate further attacks.
- **Remote code execution:** By combining the information disclosure with other vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution in the context of the user running the vulnerable application (e.g., Internet Explorer).

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file using an application that utilizes the VBScript scripting engine, such as Internet Explorer.
- An attacker can also embed a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.
- Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content can also be used as a delivery mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content (either directly or via compromised websites).
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to open or interact with the malicious content.
- The attacker requires a user to use a vulnerable version of VBScript, typically through Internet Explorer.
