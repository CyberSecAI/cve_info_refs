Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the 'message' field of the WordPress MDC Private Message plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the message field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the victim views the malicious message.
- A less privileged user (e.g., Editor, Author) can attack an Administrator.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal cookies, or redirect the victim to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious message containing JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('Hello!')</script>`) and sends it via the private messaging functionality.
- The victim then opens the private message, triggering the execution of the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, with at least Editor, Author, or similar privileges, which allow them to send private messages.
- No special capabilities are required beyond basic user privileges within the WordPress system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported on August 20, 2015 and the vendor released version 1.0.1 on August 19, 2015.
- The vulnerability is in version 1.0.0 of the WordPress MDC Private Message plugin.
