Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure in Windows DNS servers to properly parse incoming requests. This improper parsing leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The code runs within the context of the Local System Account, granting the attacker significant control over the compromised server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted DNS Requests:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted malicious requests to a Windows DNS server. This could be done by creating an application to connect to the server and send the malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access to DNS Server:** The attacker must be able to connect to and send requests to a Windows DNS server. This implies network proximity or the ability to route traffic to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious DNS Requests:** The attacker needs the knowledge and capability to construct the specific malicious DNS requests that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows Servers configured as DNS servers.
- Microsoft was not aware of any attacks exploiting the vulnerability at the time the security bulletin was initially released.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The provided content references Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2 as affected.
