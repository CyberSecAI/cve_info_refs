Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cisco IOS Software handles access control lists (ACLs) on tunnel interfaces. Specifically, if an ACL on the physical interface allows traffic, the ACLs on the tunnel interface can be bypassed by an unauthenticated, remote user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ACL Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass configured ACLs on tunnel interfaces. This means that traffic which should be blocked by the tunnel interface ACL can still pass through.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass ACLs on tunnel interfaces and potentially access resources or networks that should be protected by those ACLs.
*   **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality, meaning the attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information. However, the full scope of the confidentiality impact is not detailed here and would depend on the specific network and resources protected by the bypassed ACLs.
*  **Integrity and Availability:** There is no indication of any impact on the integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote, requiring an attacker to be connected to the vulnerable device via the tunnel interface.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to a tunnel interface on the affected Cisco device.
*  **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS Software versions 15.2(04)M6 and 15.4(03)S.
*   The advisory states there are no known workarounds.
*   The issue is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCur01042.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 5.0, with a temporal score of 4.1 due to the fact that a functional exploit is available.
*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is associated with the vulnerability. Although the description doesn't explicitly mention input validation, it's a general classification that can apply to the issue of ACL bypass. It is possible that the vulnerability relates to the software not correctly enforcing ACL rules based on the incoming interface.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass tunnel ACLs and access the protected resources behind the tunnel.
