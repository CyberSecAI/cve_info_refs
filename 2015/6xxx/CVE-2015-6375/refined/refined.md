**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the debug logging function of Cisco Networking Services (CNS) used for configuring Cisco IOS networking devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The debug logging function, when enabled, can expose sensitive information to an attacker.
- This is a case of information disclosure due to improper handling of debug logging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The impact is rated as "Partial" for Confidentiality, and "None" for Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the network, requiring an attacker to be authenticated to a vulnerable device via the command-line interface (CLI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account to log into the affected Cisco IOS device using the CLI.
- The attacker also needs the privilege to issue the `debug cns ...` command.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (Access Complexity: Low, Authentication: Single)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Cisco IOS running CNS.
- A workaround is provided: avoid using the `debug cns ...` command.
