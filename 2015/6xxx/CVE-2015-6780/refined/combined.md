Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/12/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, December 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 47 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 47.0.2526.73 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/46.0.2490.86..47.0.2526.73?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 47.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes **[41 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M47&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles).** Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[563930](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=563930)] CVE-2015-6787: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.7 branch (currently 4.7.80.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [**AddressSanitizer**](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [**MemorySanitizer**](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# CVE-2015-6782

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-6781.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-6783.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-6782 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6782)

#### Description

The Document::open function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 does not ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal-dialog blocking, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof Omnibox content via a crafted web site.

Trying it out, it seems to obviate much of the rest of this CL (!). So, simpler fix coming in the next patchset.
