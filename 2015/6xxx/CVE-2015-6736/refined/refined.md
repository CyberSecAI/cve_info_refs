Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Quiz extension for MediaWiki did not properly escape regex metacharacters in user-controlled regular expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper input sanitization: User-provided data was used directly in regular expression functions (`preg_match`) without proper escaping.
-  Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS): Crafted regular expressions could cause excessive resource consumption, leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers could craft input that results in inefficient regular expressions, consuming server resources and potentially causing the application to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User-controlled input: The vulnerability is triggered by user input used within a regular expression in the Quiz extension. This user input is not sanitized/escaped.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit input that can be used in the quiz extension. This does not necessarily require a user account with specific privileges.
- Ability to understand and exploit regular expression behavior to craft malicious patterns is required.
