      "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to leak sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the DOM after changing the text direction. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to leak sensitive information under the context of the current process.",
