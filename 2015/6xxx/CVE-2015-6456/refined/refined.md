**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6456

**Vulnerability:** GE MDS PulseNET Hidden Support Account Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The GE MDS PulseNET web service contains a hidden support account with static, hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798):** The software contains a support account with static credentials, which allows unauthorized access.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The static credentials allow an attacker to bypass the normal authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could result in complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Web Service:** The vulnerability exists within the PulseNET web service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GE MDS PulseNET system.
*   **Static Credentials:** The attacker needs to use the hardcoded credentials to gain access (although, this vulnerability allows them to bypass authentication requirements using the static credentials)

**Additional Details:**
*   GE has released a software update (Version 3.1.5) to address this vulnerability, as well as the path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2015-6459).
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter IDs '19904' and '19905'.
