  "CVE-2015-6175": {
    "description": "Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of objects in memory."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vector": "An attacker must first log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application."
