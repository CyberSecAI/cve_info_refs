- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A deserialization vulnerability exists involving Apache Commons-collections and a specially constructed chain of classes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization vulnerability using Apache Commons-collections library.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution with the permissions of the application using the Commons-collections library. In the case of vCenter Application Discovery Manager, exploitation is limited to local privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted chain of classes is used to exploit the deserialization vulnerability, which is then processed by the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to provide the specially constructed chain of classes to the application. This could be through a network connection or local access.
