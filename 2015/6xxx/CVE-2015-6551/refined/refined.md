Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The communication between the NetBackup administration console and the NetBackup server is not sufficiently protected. Specifically, the key exchange is weak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Key Exchange:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak key exchange mechanism when establishing a connection between the administration console and the NetBackup server. This allows for the capture of login credentials by sniffing network traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can capture login credentials.
*   **Privileged Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to full privileged access to the targeted server, allowing the attacker to perform any administrative function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the internal network and sniffing network traffic to intercept login credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Internal Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the internal network where the vulnerable NetBackup server and administrative console are communicating.
*   **Network Sniffing Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic to intercept the vulnerable communications.
*   **Knowledge of communication protocols:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the NetBackup communications protocols.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not present in NetBackup 7.6.1 (Appliance 2.6.1) and above as they use TLS to protect login communications.
*   The document mentions that the vulnerability has been addressed in security hotfixes for affected NetBackup versions.
