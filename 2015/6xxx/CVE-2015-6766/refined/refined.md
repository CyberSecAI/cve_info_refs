Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6766:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **use-after-free** error within the **AppCache implementation** of Google Chrome. Specifically, it occurs due to incorrect `AppCacheUpdateJob` behavior when handling duplicate cache selections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is that a memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service, likely by crashing the browser.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** The CVE description mentions the potential for "unspecified other impact". This could include, but is not limited to, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other unexpected behaviors, due to the nature of use-after-free vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker.
*   **Renderer Access:** The attacker needs to have renderer access, which is typically gained by the user visiting a maliciously crafted webpage.
*   **Crafted JavaScript:** The attack involves leveraging a crafted web page or JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted web page or JavaScript to the victim's browser.
