The provided content is related to CVE-2015-6010.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various files, including:
*   `install.php` via `adminUserName`, `pathToMYSQL`, `databaseStructureFile`, and `pathToBibutils` POST parameters.
*   `error.php` via `errorNo` and `errorMsg` GET parameters.
*   `duplicate_manager.php` via the `viewType` GET parameter.
*   `query_manager.php` via multiple GET parameters such as `queryAction`, `displayType`, `citeOrder`, `sqlQuery`, `showQuery`, `showLinks`, and `showRows` when the `customQuery` GET parameter is set to "1". When `customQuery` is not set to "1", the `queryID` GET parameter is vulnerable.
*    `import.php` via `sourceText` and `sourceIDs` POST parameters.
*    `update.php` via the `adminUserName` POST parameter.
Stored XSS vulnerability:
*   `modify.php` via the `typeName` and `fileName` POST parameters. The injected Javascript in these stored values will not be safely escaped when rendered by `search.php` and `advanced_search.php` pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. The stored XSS vulnerability allows for persistent attacks impacting multiple users viewing the affected pages.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Sending crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable pages (`install.php`, `error.php`, `duplicate_manager.php`, `query_manager.php`).
*   Submitting crafted POST requests with malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable parameters in `install.php`, `import.php` and `update.php`.
*   Persistently injecting malicious JavaScript through POST request in `modify.php` and displaying them through `search.php` and `advanced_search.php`.
*   Lack of CSRF protections on the `query_manager.php` page allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable application. For reflected XSS attacks, this typically means enticing a user to click a malicious link. For stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to modify the database through the modify.php page.
