This document discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-6082.

**CVE-2015-6082**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** This is a memory corruption vulnerability. Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability, and convince a user to view the website. Attackers could also compromise websites that host user-provided content or advertisements, injecting malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise existing websites. They must then convince a user to visit the malicious page, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document provides a comprehensive list of affected software, including various versions of Internet Explorer running on different Windows operating systems, along with the severity ratings.
*   The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   The document states that Microsoft was not aware of any public disclosure or exploitation at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   It also mentions that EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate these vulnerabilities if configured properly.
