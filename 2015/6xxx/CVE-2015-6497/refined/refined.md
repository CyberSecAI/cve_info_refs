  "CVE-2015-6497": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the *Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Api_V2::create()* method, which handles the `catalogProductCreate` SOAP API call. The method uses the `property_exists()` function with user-controlled input from the `productData` parameter without proper validation. This can trigger the autoload function, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion when the application runs on vulnerable PHP versions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Autoloaded File Inclusion",
          "Lack of input validation",
          "Improper use of `property_exists()`",
          "Use of vulnerable PHP versions"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution on the server, potentially leading to a complete compromise, including credit card information and personal data theft. Depending on the configuration, both local and remote file inclusion is possible.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "SOAP API calls to `catalogProductCreate`",
          "Manipulation of the `productData` SOAP parameter with malicious classnames"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Valid API user account with privileges to create catalog products",
          "Vulnerable PHP version (before 5.4.24 or 5.5.8)",
          "Optionally, allow_url_include set to On or other wrapper access (ssh2, expect)",
            "Access to a publicly accessible network"
      ]
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability resides in how Magento handles user-controlled input through the SOAP API, specifically within the `catalogProductCreate` method. The `property_exists()` function, called on the productData input, triggers the autoloader if a non-class string is provided. Due to a bug in PHP versions prior to 5.4.24 and 5.5.8, the autoloader could be invoked with invalid class names, leading to file inclusion.",

          ],

    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is in the way the `Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Api_V2::create()` method uses the `property_exists()` function on potentially malicious input from the `productData` parameter. This triggers the autoloader, especially on older versions of PHP where invalid class names can be used to initiate a file inclusion.",
