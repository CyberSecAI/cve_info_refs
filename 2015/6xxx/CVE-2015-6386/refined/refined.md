Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the native passthrough FTP functionality of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of FTP traffic leads to excessive CPU utilization when native FTP is enabled on the WSA.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a CWE-399, which indicates a resource management error that could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause a partial denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected Cisco WSA due to high CPU utilization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and does not require any authentication.
- The attack is directed towards the vulnerable native FTP passthrough functionality of the Cisco Web Security Appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco Web Security Appliance.
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists only if native FTP is enabled on the WSA.
- The provided CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C, which breaks down as:
