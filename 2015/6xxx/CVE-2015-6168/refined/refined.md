{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability relates to how Microsoft Edge deletes elements from attribute arrays (as implemented by CAttrArray). By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can cause Edge to read memory outside the bounds of the array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Edge. An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript does not prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage, and convince the victim to open it in Microsoft Edge."
