    "vulnerability": "Use-after-free in win32k.sys",
    "description": "The attached testcase triggers a use-after-free condition in win32k. The attached debugger output was triggered on Windows 7 with Special Pool enabled on win32k.sys.",
    "root_cause": "Invalid GDI object handle passed to gdi32!NtGdiStartPage, leading to a user-mode exception and subsequent freeing of a surface object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of GDI object handles.",

    "description": "Root cause analysis of CVE-2015-6100 led to discovery of an alternative way to trigger the same UAF vulnerability, even after the specified patch has been applied due to weak security fixes. The surface object is freed under win32k!NtGdiStartPage upon failing to execute the user-mode callback routine because of the access violation triggered in user32!__ClientPrinterThunk when an invalid printer DC was passed to the function.",

      "Use-after-free vulnerability caused by improper handling of GDI object handles.",
