##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Security Update for Microsoft Windows to Address Remote Code Execution (3105864)

Published: November 10, 2015 | Updated: April 7, 2016

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded fonts.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Windows handles objects in memory
* Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows handles embedded fonts
* Windows Kernel validates certain permissions

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3105864](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3105864).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Kernel Memory Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the way that Windows handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the target system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory.

# Root Cause Analysis of Windows Kernel UAF Vulnerability lead to CVE-2016-3310

By
[Wayne Chin Yick Low](/blog/search?author=Wayne+Chin+Yick+Low)

 | August 16, 2016

In the first quarter of 2016, we realized that there were tons of windows kernel use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability patches in Microsoft bulletins where most of the vulnerabilities came from Google Project Zero, which is favourable to us because we can easily access those proof-of-concepts (POC). While doing a root cause analysis of one of the UAF vulnerabilities stated in CVE-2015-6100, we discovered that there is an alternative way to trigger the same UAF vulnerability, even after the specified patch has been applied due to weak security fixes. In this blog post, we will discuss the journey of unveiling CVE-2016-3310 as specified in [MS16-098](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-098)

### Root cause analysis of CVE-2015-6100

Before we started analysing the POC, we first enabled special pool on the target machine using verifier.exe to could help us to identify the exact faulty code that triggered the UAF. After special pool was set accordingly, we easily spotted the UAF by running the POC (please note that this analysis was performed on a Windows 7 x86 platform):

Listing 1: Faulty code that trigger use-after-free vulnerability

After some back-tracing, the offending code was found at *win32k!DC::bMakeInfoDC*. We were then able to determine that the freed object is a surface object (also known as a bitmap object in user-mode context), which is located at the HDCOBJ+1F8. Next, we tried to find out the type of the freed object. Note that at this point we disabled the special pool in the following WinDBG output in order to find out the object type of the pointer stored at HDCOBJ+1F8:

Listing 2: Determine the freed object type

One of the important questions that needed to be answered when it came to our vulnerability analysis is how did the UAF occur in the first place? If we look at the POC, we can see the *gdi32!NtGdiStartPage* call is wrapped around by a try-catch block. As commented by the POC, a user-mode exception occurs when the function *gdi32!NtGdiStartPage* is called. The following diagram depicts its call sequences:

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/root-cause-analysis-of-windows-kernel-uaf-vulnerability-lead-to-cve-2016-3310-1846.png)

Figure 1: Call-sequences lead to user-mode exception

In a nutshell, when we looked at the code where the user-mode exception occurred, we were able to determine that the UAF happened due to an invalid GDI object handle being passed to *gdi32!NtGdiStartPage*. Our findings were confirmed when we discovered that the CVE-2015-6100 patch contains additional code validating the GDI object handle value on the affected GDI functions after diffing against win32k.sys binaries (See Figure 2). Based on the diffing result, we knew that some of the affected GDI functions that can lead to the same user-mode exception include:

* *win32k!NtGdiStartPage*
* *win32k!NtGdiEndPage*
* *win32k!GreStartDocInternal*
* *win32k!bEndDocInternal*

Figure 3: win32k!NtGdiStartPage epilog

Our next question was “when did the surface object pointed at HDCOBJ+1F8” get freed? In the event of the crash being handled by POC, it would continue to execute and return to the caller of the user-mode callback function *user32!\_\_ClientPrinterThunk*. As demonstrated by the code block in Figure 3, we can clearly show that if the user-mode callback function has failed to execute properly and returns NULL, it will proceed to the branch *loc\_BF99F796* in an attempt to disable and then free the surface object. It is important to note that by disabling the surface object, it synonymously decreases the reference count of the target object stored at GDIOBJ+0x4, as seen in this example:

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/root-cause-analysis-of-windows-kernel-uaf-vulnerability-lead-to-cve-2016-3310-1849.png)

Listing 3: Demonstrate the reference count and exclusive lock of a GDI object

Some GDI objects can only be freed when the object reference count and its exclusive lock become NULL. This is exactly the routine carried out by *win32k!bEndDocInternal* upon returning from *win32k!UMPDDrvStartPage*. The following pseudo-code briefly illustrates the operations of *win32k!bEndDocInternal*:

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/root-cause-analysis-of-windows-kernel-uaf-vulnerability-lead-to-cve-2016-3310-1850.png)

Listing 4: Pseudocode to show the operations of *win32k!bEndDocInternal*

In short, the code figure above instructs another user-mode callback function to disable the surface object through *win32k!UMPDDrvDisableSurface,* which eventually triggers the user-mode callback to free the target surface object, as can be seen in the following call-stack:

Listing 5: Call-stack when the surface object is freed upon calling *win32k!UMPDDrvDisableSurface*

In summary, we drew the following conclusion on how and when the UAF occurred:

* When an invalid GDI object handle passed to GDI printing functions, it could cause user-mode code exception
* If the exception was handled by the program, one could free and delete the surface object specified in the device context via *win32k!bEndDocInternal*
* Afterwards, any GDI printing function call that dereferences the freed surface object will also lead to a use-after-free vulnerability

### Abusing user-mode callback leads to arbitrary free of GDI object – CVE-2016-3310

After some reverse-engineering, we discovered that one can free a surface object under a device context (DC) by calling either one of the following win32k GDI functions:

1. *win32k!NtGdiAbortDoc*
2. *win32k!NtGdiEndDoc*
3. *win32k!NtGdiStartPage*

To recap, the surface object is freed under *win32k!NtGdiStartPage* upon failing to execute the user-mode callback routine because of the access violation triggered in *user32!\_\_ClientPrinterThunk* when an invalid printer DC was passed to the function. If the exception is caught by the program, then the UAFvulnerability can be triggered.

In the response from MSRC, the affected GDI functions were patched in such a way that the input DC handle is now being validated, and only printer DC is allowed to execute the identified routines. This seemed to be an easy and straight forward fix to prevent the surface object from being freed on demand. However there is alternative way to free the surface object.

It’s worth mentioning here that every surface object stores a reference count and exclusive lock in order to prevent the object from being freed a user mode API call, like the *gdi32!DeleteObject* function. However, one can first disable the surface object and then free the surface object using user-mode API *gdi32!DeleteObject*. While there didn’t seem to be any apparent way to disable the surface object, we discovered that we could take advantage of one of the GDI functions highlighted in Figure 4 that would eventually call *win32k!PDEVOBJ::vDisableSurface* to disable the target surface object.

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/root-cause-analysis-of-windows-kernel-uaf-vulnerability-lead-to-cve-2016-3310-1851.png)

Figure 4: Xrefs of *win32k!bEndDocInternal*

Either *win32k!NtGdiAbortDoc* or *win32k!NtGdiEndDoc* appeared to be a good candidate for us. However, there are some requirements that need to be met in order to properly lead us to the code path that will execute the *win32k!PDEVOBJ::vDisableSurface* function:

1. Printer DC is needed
2. The surface object pointer at HDC+1F8 cannot be NULL; it will be scrutinized in *win32k!XDCOBJ::bValidSurf*

The first requirement can be easily achieved by creating a printer DC using “winspool” as a driver name in the *CreateDC* function. After further reverse-engineering to better understand the highlighted function in Listing 1, we realized that it plays a crucial role that could greatly help us achieve our second objective. In general, the steps can be summarized as follows:

1. Get a printer DC and then start the print job.
2. Call *win32k!NtGdiMakeInfoDC* to store the surface object pointer at HDC+0x8C8 to HDC+0x1F8
3. Hook *user32!\_\_ClientPrinterThunk*. The hook handler will be triggered when *win32k!NtGdiEndDoc* is executed, and it then executes the *win32k!NtGdiMakeInfoDC* function to restore the surface object pointer from HDC+0x1F8 to HDC+0x8C8.
4. At the epilogue of *win32k!bEndDocInternal*, the surface object reference count will then be disabled by decreasing the reference count to 0.
5. From our controlled program, we were now able to free the disabled surface object simply by calling the *gdi32!DeleteObject* API function.

In summary, the use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in CVE-2016-3310 is somewhat related to the previously patched CVE-2015-6100  vulnerability, which is a low-hanging fruit opportunity that can be spotted by understanding the root cause of the original vulnerability through manual analysis, binary diffing, and code auditing. However, engineering bug-free software, especially for robust software, remains highly challenging, so we should not point the finger at any software vendors who puts software security as their first priority. At Fortinet, weactively participate in coordinated vulnerability disclosures with major software vendors to proactively protect end-users.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to take control of an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:
