Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6164:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to properly enforce cross-domain policies. Specifically, the XSS filter in Internet Explorer does not correctly disable HTML attributes, which leads to the bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Filter Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the XSS filter, allowing the injection of malicious scripts by manipulating the way HTML attributes are disabled in HTTP responses. This bypass results in incorrect handling of the security context.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access information from one domain and inject it into another domain. This could lead to the theft of sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although this vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, it can be chained with other vulnerabilities, like a remote code execution vulnerability, to escalate privileges and run code at a higher integrity level (permissions of the current user) rather than a low integrity level.
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** The vulnerability allows initially disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context and can lead to scripts executing in a different domain and taking actions on the user's system as permitted by the visited website.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content, to trigger the vulnerability when users visit those sites.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker has to convince users to visit the malicious web page by some means like tricking them into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site, usually in an email or IM message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website that a targeted user is likely to visit.
- The attacker would have to convince users to view the malicious content or click on a malicious link.
- No specific level of access to the target system is required beyond the ability to serve web content.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a list of other CVEs addressed by the same security update (MS15-124).
- This vulnerability is rated "Important" on Windows clients and "Low" on Windows servers.
- There are no identified workarounds or mitigating factors for this specific vulnerability.
- This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.
