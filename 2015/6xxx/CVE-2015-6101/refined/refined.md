Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6101:

**CVE-2015-6101: Windows Kernel Memory Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Windows handles objects in memory, which can lead to an elevation of privilege. A race condition exists in the `win32k.sys` component related to the `DestroySMWP` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** A race condition in the kernel can cause a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been freed.
    *   **Improper Memory Handling:** The root cause involves how Windows manages objects in memory, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining complete control over the system.
    *   **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system.
    *   **Specially Crafted Application:** The vulnerability is triggered by running a specifically designed application that exploits the memory handling flaw.
    *   **Race Condition:** Exploitation requires triggering a race condition between two threads, which can be more reliable on multi-core systems.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit for this vulnerability is publicly available, which increases the risk of exploitation.
*   The exploit is described as a "Race Condition DestroySMWP Use-After-Free" in the provided Exploit-DB entry.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-115.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for elevation of privilege, but the bulletin aggregates several vulnerabilities with a maximum severity rating of "Critical" due to other remote code execution vulnerabilities addressed in the same update.

In summary, CVE-2015-6101 is a critical vulnerability because it can lead to complete system compromise, and its exploitation requires local access and execution of a crafted application that triggers a race condition.
