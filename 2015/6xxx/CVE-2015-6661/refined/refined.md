Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises because Drupal's menu system allows users without "access content" permission to see the titles of nodes they don't have access to, provided those nodes are included in a menu they can access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure: The primary weakness is the exposure of node titles to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can gain unauthorized knowledge of the existence and titles of content they do not have explicit permissions to view. This could reveal sensitive information. The impact is primarily an information disclosure issue, not direct data manipulation or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through Drupal's menu system.
- A malicious user needs access to a menu that contains links to nodes they are not authorized to see directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Drupal site.
- The attacker does not need special privileges; they just need to be able to access a menu.
- The attacker does not need to directly manipulate any nodes or settings, they only access existing menus.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in Drupal 7.14-2+deb7u11 (for Debian Wheezy), 7.32-1+deb8u5 (for Debian Jessie), and 7.39-1 (for Debian Stretch and Sid).
- The provided text includes other CVEs fixed in the same update, but these are separate vulnerabilities.
