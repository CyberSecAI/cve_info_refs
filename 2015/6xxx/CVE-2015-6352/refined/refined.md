Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a flaw in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager that allows an attacker to map the file system structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the file system structure, which could reveal sensitive information about the system. This is categorized as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*  **URI Enumeration:** The advisory specifies this vulnerability as a "URI Enumeration Vulnerability". This suggests the system is vulnerable to enumeration of URIs potentially exposing file system structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain knowledge of the file system structure. Although not explicitly stated, this could potentially lead to further attacks by revealing sensitive files or configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easier to target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Credentials:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to carry out the attack.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires some technical skill to construct the necessary requests to enumerate the file system structure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS score is 4.3 (Base) and 3.4 (Temporal) which indicates a medium severity.
*   The exploitability is rated as "Proof-of-Concept", meaning that exploit code is available but might require modifications to work in specific situations.
*   A fix is available and customers are advised to upgrade to version 10.6(1) or later.
*   There are no known workarounds available.
