Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cisco IOS Software handles access control lists (ACLs) on virtual PPP interfaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ACL Bypass:** When a user connects to an authenticated PPP session, ACLs configured on the *virtual* PPP interface can be bypassed. This occurs if the ACL on the *physical* interface allows the traffic to pass through. Essentially, the system incorrectly prioritizes the physical interface ACL over the virtual interface ACL.
- **Incorrect ACL Prioritization:**  The vulnerability lies in the incorrect order of ACL processing where the physical interface ACL takes precedence over the virtual interface ACL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Policy Violation:** An attacker can bypass the intended access control policies enforced by the virtual interface ACLs.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This bypass can potentially grant a connected user unauthorized access to network resources or services that should have been restricted by the virtual PPP interface's ACLs.
- **Integrity Impact:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to bypass ACLs could lead to a compromise in the integrity of network traffic and systems that are protected by these ACLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must establish a valid authenticated PPP session.
- The attacker needs to send traffic that is allowed by the physical interface ACL but would have been blocked by the virtual interface ACL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated PPP User:** The attacker needs to be a user who is able to successfully authenticate via PPP.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to connect to the affected device through a PPP session.
- **Knowledge of ACL Configuration:** Although not strictly necessary to perform the attack, an attacker with knowledge of the ACL configuration can choose to target specific resources based on which virtual ACLs are bypassed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(04)M and 15.4(03)M.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A fix is available through software upgrades and customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive to get the latest fix and determine their full upgrade path.
- The CVSS score is 4.0 (Base) and 3.3 (Temporal) with the vector AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
