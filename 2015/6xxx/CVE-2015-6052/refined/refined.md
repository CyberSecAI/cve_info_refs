{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The VBScript and JScript engines fail to use Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Security Feature Bypass",
      "ASLR bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can more reliably predict memory offsets of specific instructions, which facilitates exploitation of other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-browsing: User visits a malicious website.",
       "ActiveX control: Embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' within an application or Office document"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or embed a malicious ActiveX control, then convince the user to view it.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution by itself. It is a security feature bypass that makes exploitation more reliable when combined with other vulnerabilities. The vulnerability affects systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier, or systems without Internet Explorer installed."
