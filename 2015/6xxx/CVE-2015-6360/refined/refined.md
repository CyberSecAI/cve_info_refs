Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6360:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents explicitly mention **CVE-2015-6360** and detail a vulnerability in the `libsrtp` library, which is Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **insufficient input sanitization** when processing certain fields in an SRTP packet. Specifically, the issue lies in how `libsrtp` handles RTP header CSRC count and extension header length.
*   This leads to an **integer underflow** when processing a specially crafted SRTP packet.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `libsrtp` library does not properly validate the fields within the SRTP packets.
*   **Integer Underflow:**  A crafted SRTP packet can trigger an integer underflow in the `libsrtp` library's processing logic.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The integer underflow can cause a failure of subsequent memory operations, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can crash an application linked against `libsrtp`.
*   **Application Crash/System Restart:** The memory corruption can lead to application crashes or, in some cases, a system restart.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a specially crafted SRTP packet to an affected device.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted SRTP packet designed to trigger the issue to an affected device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability. They only need network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to craft SRTP packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send specifically crafted SRTP packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability existed in all versions of `libsrtp` prior to version 1.5.3.
*   The impact on specific Cisco products varies depending on the affected product.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Randell Jesup of the Mozilla team.
*   Multiple Cisco products were affected by this vulnerability.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v2 Base Score:** 7.8
*   **CVSS v2 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:U/RC:C

In summary, CVE-2015-6360 is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to improper input validation in `libsrtp`. It allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to crash applications by sending crafted SRTP packets, which triggers an integer underflow and subsequent memory corruption.
