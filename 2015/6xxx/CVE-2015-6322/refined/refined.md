Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Move:** The core weakness allows a local attacker to move arbitrary files on the system.
- **Elevated Privileges:** This file move operation can be performed with elevated privileges, meaning the attacker can move files they would normally not have access to move.
- **Improper Access Control:** The IPC channel is not properly secured, allowing for unauthorized file system manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete loss of file integrity because the attacker can move files, potentially disrupting system functionality or data availability.
- **Availability Impact:** Since arbitrary files can be moved, this could lead to denial of service by moving required files to unavailable locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the affected Windows system where the Cisco AnyConnect client is running.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the local machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on a Windows system running the vulnerable Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the system's IPC mechanism to trigger the vulnerability.
