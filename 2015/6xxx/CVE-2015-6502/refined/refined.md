- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Puppet Enterprise Console does not properly validate the string parameter used to set the URL target for the next page transition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically of the URL target parameter. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed after a successful login. This could allow an attacker to perform actions as the logged-in user or redirect them to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the URL target parameter during login. This requires the attacker to have knowledge of the login mechanism and the vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to modify the request sent to the Puppet Enterprise console during login, specifically by crafting a malicious URL.
