Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Aironet 1850 Series Access Point. It is related to how the CLI handles user privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper privilege management within the CLI, allowing an authenticated user to gain elevated privileges.
- Specifically, an authenticated, local attacker can escalate to a *root*-level restricted shell.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-264, which refers to "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can escalate privileges beyond their assigned user role.
-  Gaining *root*-level privileges allows complete control over the device.
- This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities including modifying configurations, injecting malware, and causing denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the device's command-line interface (CLI) is required.
- The attacker must be authenticated to the device with a low-level privilege account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to the access point's CLI.
- The attacker must have local access to the device.
