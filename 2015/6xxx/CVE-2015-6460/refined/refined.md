Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6460

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs due to improper handling of specific opcodes (0x3ef and 0x3f0) within the CODESYS Gateway Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Heap buffer overflow: Sending a large buffer of data to the server while processing opcodes 0x3ef or 0x3f0 can overwrite memory on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server. This code will run within the context of the CODESYS Gateway Server process.
*   **Control System Impact**: The advisory from CISA notes that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a buffer overflow condition that may allow remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker can send specially crafted packets over the network to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable CODESYS Gateway Server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, which significantly broadens the potential attack surface.
*   **Crafted Packets:**  Attackers need the ability to craft packets with the specific opcodes (0x3ef or 0x3f0) and an oversized data payload to cause the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions two different opcodes (0x3ef and 0x3f0), each leading to a similar heap overflow vulnerability. However, the vulnerability details from TrendMicro's ZDI are listed as different advisories: ZDI-15-441 (0x3ef) and ZDI-15-442 (0x3f0). Both have been assigned to CVE-2015-6460.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected with a specific filter (ID '19577').
*   CODESYS has released an update (Version 2.3.9.34) to fix this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   The ICS advisory notes that this vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity.
