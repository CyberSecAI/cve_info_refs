{
  "CVE-2015-6773": {
    "Description": "The convolution implementation in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, does not properly constrain row lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted graphics data.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper constraint of row lengths in Skia's convolution implementation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash), potentially other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted graphics data.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker able to provide the crafted graphics data."
  }
