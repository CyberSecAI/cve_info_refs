Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6822:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2015-6822` in the context of a `libav` security update.
*   The description aligns with the provided CVE description: it is a vulnerability related to incorrect management of height and width values in `avcodec/sanm.c` leading to denial of service.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `destroy_buffers` function in `libavcodec/sanm.c` fails to properly maintain height and width values in the video context.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper maintenance of video context parameters.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   Specifically, exploitation causes a segmentation violation, leading to an application crash.
*   Possibility of other unspecified impacts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   Exploitation occurs via crafted LucasArts Smush video data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted LucasArts Smush video data to a system using the vulnerable libav library.
* No special privileges or access to the target system is explicitly required other than the ability to supply the crafted input, suggesting this could be achieved through user-triggered actions that process the malformed file.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information gives more detail on the specific function and cause than the official CVE description.
* The fix for this issue involves resetting the sizes in `destroy_buffers()` in `avcodec/sanm.c`.
