{
  "CVE-2015-6357": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center uses the `curl` command with the `-k` or `--insecure` option to download updates from the Sourcefire Support website, which disables SSL certificate validation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper SSL certificate validation. The FireSIGHT Management Center does not validate the SSL certificate of the server it connects to for updates.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, redirecting the update process to a malicious server under their control. This allows them to serve a malicious update script which executes with root privileges on the FireSIGHT Management Center, granting remote command execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting and redirecting the traffic between the FireSIGHT Management Center and the legitimate update server (support.sourcefire.com). This can be achieved via DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, or other MitM techniques.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the FireSIGHT Management Center and the Sourcefire Support web site, typically by controlling DNS resolution or performing ARP spoofing."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center does not validate SSL certificates when downloading IPS rule updates.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing SSL certificate validation, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks. The system uses `curl -k`, which ignores certificate errors.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution as root. By serving a malicious update script, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the FireSIGHT system with root privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack, specifically by spoofing DNS to redirect the FireSIGHT update request to an attacker-controlled server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which can be done by controlling DNS resolution for `support.sourcefire.com`."
