  "CVE-2015-6249": {
    "description": "The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not prevent the conflicting use of a table for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The WCCP dissector in Wireshark does not properly handle address tables, allowing for conflicting use of a table for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation leading to conflicting data usage",
	    "Lack of proper type checking or separation for IPv4/IPv6 address tables."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted packet that triggers the conflicting table usage, leading to an application crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network: sending a crafted packet over the network that triggers the vulnerability in the WCCP dissector."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark. Medium access complexity because a specific crafted packet is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
