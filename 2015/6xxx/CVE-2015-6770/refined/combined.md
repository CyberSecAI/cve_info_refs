The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 47 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 47.0.2526.73 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/46.0.2490.86..47.0.2526.73?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 47.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes **[41 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M47&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles).** Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[563930](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=563930)] CVE-2015-6787: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.7 branch (currently 4.7.80.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [**AddressSanitizer**](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [**MemorySanitizer**](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)

## Details

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the application cache

implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6765](/security/CVE-2015-6765),

[CVE-2015-6766](/security/CVE-2015-6766), [CVE-2015-6767](/security/CVE-2015-6767))

Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass same

origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6768](/security/CVE-2015-6768), [CVE-2015-6770](/security/CVE-2015-6770))

A security issue was discovered in the provisional-load commit

implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6769](/security/CVE-2015-6769))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the array map and filter

operations in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.

([CVE-2015-6771](/security/CVE-2015-6771))

It was discovered that the DOM implementation in Chromium does not prevent

javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-6772](/security/CVE-2015-6772))

An out-of bounds read was discovered in Skia in some cirumstances. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash. ([CVE-2015-6773](/security/CVE-2015-6773))

A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2015-6777](/security/CVE-2015-6777))

It was discovered that the Document::open function in Chromium did not

ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal dialog

blocking. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof application

UI content. ([CVE-2015-6782](/security/CVE-2015-6782))

It was discovered that the page serializer in Chromium mishandled MOTW

comments for URLs in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to inject HTML content. ([CVE-2015-6784](/security/CVE-2015-6784))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

in Chromium accepted an x.y hostname as a match for a \*.x.y pattern. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access

restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6785](/security/CVE-2015-6785))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

in Chromium accepted blob:, data: and filesystem: URLs as a match for a

* pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended

  access restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6786](/security/CVE-2015-6786))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6787](/security/CVE-2015-6787))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-8478](/security/CVE-2015-8478))
