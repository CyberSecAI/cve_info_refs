  "CVE-2015-6772": {
    "Description": "The DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, does not prevent javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code that improperly interacts with a plugin.",
    "Root cause": "Inadequate checks during javascript: URL navigation when a document is being detached.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Same Origin Policy bypass"
