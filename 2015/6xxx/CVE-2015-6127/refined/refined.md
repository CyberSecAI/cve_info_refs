Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Windows Media Center improperly handles a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file. Specifically, the 'url' parameter within the `<application>` tag of an MCL file can be manipulated to point to the MCL file itself, causing Windows Media Center to render the MCL file as a local HTML file within its embedded web browser. This bypasses security restrictions and allows for malicious code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference (CWE-706):** The application incorrectly resolves the reference of the URL within the MCL file, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Information Disclosure:**  By rendering the malicious MCL file as a local HTML file, the attacker can use JavaScript with ActiveX objects to read arbitrary files from the local file system.
- **Lack of FEATURE_LOCALMACHINE_LOCKDOWN:** The embedded Internet Explorer instance within Windows Media Center does not opt-in for the `FEATURE_LOCALMACHINE_LOCKDOWN` security feature.
- **Missing Security Checks:** The application lacks sufficient security checks on the content of the .mcl file before processing and rendering it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** An attacker could disclose local file system information by reading arbitrary files.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the identified vulnerability is an information disclosure, it can be used as a stepping stone for further attacks. The ability to execute JavaScript and access local files could lead to more severe impacts like remote code execution or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction to open the malicious MCL file.
- **Web Browsing Scenario:** A user navigates to a compromised website hosting the malicious .mcl file which is downloaded locally when the user clicks a link.
- **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker convinces the user to click a link to the .mcl file in an email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious MCL Files:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MCL file with the specific structure to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Means to Deliver MCL File:** The attacker needs a method of delivering the malicious MCL file to the victim, which can be through a compromised website, email, or any other file sharing method.
- **No Special System Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special system privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry also provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) MCL file that demonstrates the vulnerability. The PoC includes JavaScript code that uses the `MSXML2.XMLHTTP` ActiveX object to read a local file (`C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe` in the example) and then attempts to upload it to a remote server. This shows how the information leak vulnerability can lead to data exfiltration.
- The PoC highlights the importance of matching the 'url' parameter value to the MCL file name.
- The advisory from Core Security also states that the `ehexthost.exe` binary, part of Windows Media Center, loads the given URL into an embedded instance of Internet Explorer running in the local machine zone.
- The provided workaround consists of unregistering the MCL protocol handler by deleting the `[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MCL]` registry key.

The provided information from exploit-db is more detailed than the description given in the MS15-134 bulletin and the CVE description, including a PoC example.
