{
  "CVE-2015-6785": {
    "root_cause": "The CSPSource::hostMatches function in WebKit's Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation incorrectly matched a hostname without a subdomain to a wildcard pattern intended for subdomains.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect matching logic in CSP implementation."
    ],
    "impact": "Bypass of intended access restrictions, potentially leading to injection of unauthorized resources or code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious website using a policy with a wildcard source, an attacker can bypass subdomain specific restrictions.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control a website's content and use a CSP that was meant to be specific to subdomains but was instead overly broad due to the wildcard matching issue. User would need to be tricked into visiting the site."
