    "root_cause": "A .NET Framework component does not properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper implementation of ASLR security feature"
    ],
    "impact": "The ASLR bypass could allow an attacker to bypass the security feature and then load additional malicious code in an attempt to exploit another vulnerability. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code.",
