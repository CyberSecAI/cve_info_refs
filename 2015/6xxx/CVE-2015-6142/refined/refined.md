Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in how Internet Explorer processes style attributes.
- Specifically, an attacker can manipulate a document's elements to force an array allocated by a `CStyleAttrArray` object to be treated as a `CAttrArray` object. This incorrect type casting leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to type confusion.
- Improper handling of objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted web pages.
- An attacker can host a malicious website or inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- The attacker must convince the victim to view the malicious content by enticing them through emails, instant messages, or by opening malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content onto a webpage.
- The attacker also needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious webpage (e.g., through social engineering).
- No specific user rights or privileges are required beyond those needed to host or inject web content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the browser handles objects in memory and is fixed in the security updates provided by Microsoft.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the security update.
- The ZDI advisory for this CVE is ZDI-15-587.
