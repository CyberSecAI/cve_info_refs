Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6152

**Description:** This CVE refers to a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer 10. Specifically, it is located in the MSHTML!CObjectElement class.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory, leading to a use-after-free condition. The `MSHTML!CTreeNode::ComputeFormatsHelper` function attempts to access a `CObjectElement` after it has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the program accesses a memory location that has been freed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and control over program execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running Internet Explorer.
*   **System Compromise:** With code execution, the attacker can gain the same user rights as the victim. If the user is an administrator, the attacker could take full control of the system. This includes actions such as installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically through emails or other methods.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that accept user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to host a website or control content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious HTML page to the victim.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince users to visit the attacker-controlled content.
*   **Technical Skill:** Ability to craft the exploit to trigger the memory corruption.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was found in Internet Explorer 11, but this specific CVE targets Internet Explorer 10.
*   The provided exploit code includes steps to trigger a crash by visiting the crafted HTML page.
*   The provided exploit code uses the `-ms-block-progression` and `-ms-filter` styles with a `small` tag in conjunction with `applet` and `script` tags to trigger the vulnerability when `document.execCommand("JustifyLeft")` is called.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the MS15-124 security update.
*   The provided crash dump shows the access violation in `MSHTML!CTreeNode::ComputeFormatsHelper+0x53` after a `CObjectElement` has been freed using `MSHTML!CObjectElement::`vector deleting destructor`.
