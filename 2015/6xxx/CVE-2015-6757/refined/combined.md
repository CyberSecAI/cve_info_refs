[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would

incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-6755](/security/CVE-2015-6755))

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6757](/security/CVE-2015-6757))

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of

LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-6759](/security/CVE-2015-6759))

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-6761](/security/CVE-2015-6761))

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use

CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6762](/security/CVE-2015-6762))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6763](/security/CVE-2015-6763))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-7834](/security/CVE-2015-7834))

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/10/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, October 13, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 46 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 46.0.2490.71 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/45.0.2454.101..46.0.2490.71?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 46.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [24 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M46&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[542517](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=542517)] CVE-2015-6763: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* [[529489](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=529489)] CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182, CVE-2015-7183: NSS and NSPR memory corruption issues.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.6 branch (currently 4.6.85.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Issue [1327723005](/1327723005/): Fix crash during EmbeddedWorkerInstance startup sequence failures (Closed)

We must guard against that. Also some failure points in the startup sequence weren't calling OnStopped() as expected.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

USN-2770-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Oxide in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

15.04. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 15.10.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would

incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-6755](/security/CVE-2015-6755))

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6757](/security/CVE-2015-6757))

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of

LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-6759](/security/CVE-2015-6759))

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-6761](/security/CVE-2015-6761))

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use

CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6762](/security/CVE-2015-6762))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6763](/security/CVE-2015-6763))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-7834](/security/CVE-2015-7834))
