Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the SystemUI component when setting an alarm using the clock application. It allows an application to execute a task at an elevated privilege level. The core issue is that the show intent for next alarm is sent via a PendingIntent which can be hijacked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to elevate privileges beyond what a normal third-party application should have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could grant an attacker elevated capabilities, specifically the ability to perform actions that normally require `Signature` or `SignatureOrSystem` permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local malicious application needs to be installed on the device.
- The attacker needs to trigger the clock application's alarm setting functionality.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the SystemUI attempts to handle the pending intent related to setting an alarm.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- The attacker's application needs to be able to interact with the alarm setting features of the clock application and have the ability to intercept or inject intents.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0.
- The fix for this issue is present in the AOSP commit:  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/e70e8ac93807c51240b2cd9afed35bf454ea00b3
- The commit message "DO NOT MERGE Send next alarm's show intent via PendingIntent" and the associated bug id "23909438" provides additional context for the fix.
