Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr) against specific IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets within the IPv6 snooping feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr):** The device fails to adequately protect the control plane from malicious IPv6 ND packets. This lack of protection allows an attacker to overwhelm the device's control plane with crafted packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the affected Cisco device to reload (crash/reboot).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely, needing no prior access to the device.
- **Network Level Attack:** The attack occurs at the network layer using specifically crafted IPv6 ND packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials or access to the device.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device to send malicious IPv6 ND packets.
- **Traffic Flooding:** The attacker needs the capability to send a flood of specific IPv6 ND packets to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the IPv6 snooping feature is enabled on the affected Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.
- There are no workarounds, and disabling IPv6 snooping is the only mitigation until a software upgrade is performed.
- The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus19794.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 base and 6.4 temporal with vector string AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
- Affected products includes multiple version of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software with IPv6 snooping enabled
