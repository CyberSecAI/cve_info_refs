Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the HTTPS session key exchange process within certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers and Cisco SA500 Series Security Appliances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, the devices improperly handle the TLS session key exchange, leading to the potential for exposure of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to obtain the key pair used in the TLS session from the affected device. This could potentially allow the attacker to decrypt the traffic sent between the router and the user, allowing access to sensitive information like login credentials or network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- The attack does not require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to observe the network traffic (i.e., a man-in-the-middle type of position).
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or special privileges on the affected device.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** The advisory lists the specific vulnerable products and firmware versions.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available, requiring a software update for remediation.
*   **CVSS Metrics:**
    *   **Base Score:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
    *   **Temporal Score:** 3.6 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
        *   **Access Vector (AV):** Network
        *   **Access Complexity (AC):** Medium
        *   **Authentication (Au):** None
        *   **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Partial
        *   **Integrity Impact (I):** None
        *   **Availability Impact (A):** None
        *   **Exploitability (E):** Functional
        *   **Remediation Level (RL):** Official Fix
        *   **Report Confidence (RC):** Confirmed
*   **CWE:** CWE-200, which refers to information exposure.

In summary, the vulnerability is a medium-severity information disclosure issue that can be exploited remotely without authentication, potentially leading to the compromise of sensitive data within the network traffic. The vulnerability lies in how the devices handle the TLS session key exchange.
