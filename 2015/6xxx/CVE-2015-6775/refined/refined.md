Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `fpdfsdk/src/jsapi/fxjs_v8.cpp` file within the PDFium library. It stems from a failure to properly implement signatures for JavaScript API calls. This lack of signatures allows for "type confusion."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The primary weakness is the type confusion that arises from the missing signatures. This occurs when the code misinterprets the type of data being processed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, potentially crashing the application.
- **Unspecified Other Impact:** The vulnerability also carries the potential for other unspecified impacts. The lack of clarity suggests that this could involve a range of issues depending on how the type confusion is exploited, possibly including code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF Files:** A malicious PDF document could be crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
- **JavaScript API Calls:** The attack vector involves utilizing the JavaScript API within the PDFium library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, indicating a network-based attack is possible.
- **Crafted PDF:** The attacker needs to create or modify a PDF document that contains specific code to trigger the vulnerability, using the JavaScript API.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chromium version 47.0.2526.73.
- The vulnerability was rated as having "important" severity by SUSE.
- The vulnerability was credited to Atte Kettunen of OUSPG.
- The vulnerability is related to a code change in the PDFium project, specifically the addition of signatures to FXJS_V8. The code changes involved adding signatures to function calls to prevent the type confusion. The code review discussions highlight the complexity in applying the fix to the PDFium project.
