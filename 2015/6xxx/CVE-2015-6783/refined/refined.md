  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-6783",
  "description": "The FindStartOffsetOfFileInZipFile function in crazy_linker_zip.cpp in crazy_linker (aka Crazy Linker) in Android 5.x and 6.x, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, improperly searches for an EOCD record, which allows attackers to bypass a signature-validation requirement via a crafted ZIP archive.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper search for the End of Central Directory (EOCD) record within a ZIP archive in the `FindStartOffsetOfFileInZipFile` function of the Crazy Linker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The function searches for the EOCD record signature starting from a position calculated based on the size of the EOCD record bytes before the end of the file. This search method is insufficient for handling specially crafted ZIP files. If there is data appended to a ZIP, this search logic could cause the function to return an incorrect offset.",
      "Signature validation bypass: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the signature validation mechanism, which was intended to verify the authenticity of the ZIP archive's content.",
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass signature validation by crafting a malicious ZIP archive with a manipulated EOCD record.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted ZIP archive: An attacker provides a specially crafted ZIP archive.",
      "Network: The malicious ZIP archive can be delivered over the network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious zip archive, which does not require high skill or specific positioning within the system."
