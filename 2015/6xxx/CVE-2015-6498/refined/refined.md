{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the TR-069 protocol, specifically how Automatic Configuration Servers (ACS) handle CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) identification, allowing for impersonation attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper validation and authorization checks in the TR-069 protocol for CPE identification.",
      "Vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the absence of anti-spoofing filters or sufficient authorization checks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could spoof a CPE and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as third-party SIP credentials, potentially leading to phone fraud and other illegal activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks using the TR-069 protocol."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send and receive TR-069 protocol messages and to craft malicious packets impersonating a CPE. No privileged access to the network or device is required, only the ability to reach the ACS with TR-069 messages."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Alcatel-Lucent Home Device Manager versions prior to 4.1.10 (without filtering or authorization checks) and prior to 4.2.2 (without filtering or authorization checks)."
  ],
  "remediation": "Update to Home Device Manager Version 4.1.10 or higher, or 4.2.2 or higher and activate the anti-spoofing filters. Alternatively, implement customer-specific filters or additional authorization checks.",
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was discovered by Dr. Ulrich Fiedler and his team at BFH-TI Biel/Bienne. Swisscom CSIRT coordinated the disclosure. An anti-spoofing filter was developed by Alcatel-Lucent as a customer-specific extension before this public disclosure."
