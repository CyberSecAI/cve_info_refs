Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Common Internet File System (CIFS) optimization feature of the Cisco Wide Area Application Service (WAAS) device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A resource consumption vulnerability is present within the CIFS optimization feature. Specifically, a flaw in the handling of CIFS traffic allows an attacker to consume excessive resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a complete denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected Cisco WAAS device. The device might become unresponsive and require a reload. The device may also generate a core file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specific network traffic to the affected WAAS device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco WAAS device. No authentication is required, meaning that an attacker does not need any specific credentials to initiate the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in WAAS version 5.1.1d.
- The provided CVSS vector is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C which translates to:
  -   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
  -   **AC:L (Low):** The attack is easy to perform and does not require any special conditions.
  -   **Au:N (None):** No authentication is required for exploitation.
  -   **C:N (None):** There is no impact on confidentiality.
  -   **I:N (None):** There is no impact on integrity.
  -   **A:C (Complete):** The attack can cause a complete loss of availability.
  -   **E:F (Functional):** Functional exploit code is available.
  -   **RL:OF (Official Fix):** An official fix is available.
  -   **RC:C (Confirmed):** The vulnerability is confirmed.
- A workaround is available involving disabling part of the *cifs-ao* optimization process via the command `# accelerator cifs expert RxCIFS IOCTLHandling true`. This may cause a minor performance impact in the optimization of CIFS traffic.
- Fixed software versions are available for the affected releases.
- There is no public announcement or malicious use of this vulnerability that was known at the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cisco TAC during resolution of a support case.
