Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2015-6702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located within the handling of the `createSquareMesh` function in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a memory leak vulnerability. Specifically, when improper arguments are passed to the `createSquareMesh` function, it returns excess values in the error message. These excess values reveal information about the memory layout of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The vulnerability by itself leads to information disclosure. An attacker can glean details about the memory layout of the affected system. This information can then be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to further compromise the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, requiring user interaction. This means an attacker would need to lure a victim into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to craft a malicious page or file that contains the crafted arguments to trigger the `createSquareMesh` function vulnerability in the target's Adobe Reader DC. The attacker would then need to get the victim to interact with the crafted content. They also need to be able to interpret and use the leaked memory information.
