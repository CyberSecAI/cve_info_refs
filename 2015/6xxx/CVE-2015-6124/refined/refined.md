- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability in how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. This can be achieved through email attachments or by enticing the user to visit a website hosting the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file and convince the user to open it. This could be achieved via social engineering techniques, such as email or instant messages with links.
