Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6075:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in Internet Explorer when processing images specified using the CSS `url()` function. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a `CElement`-derived object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability, where a memory object is accessed after it has been released/freed. This can lead to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
- **Improper memory management:**  The root cause is that Internet Explorer does not properly handle the lifecycle of objects associated with the `url()` CSS function, leading to the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user, enabling them to perform actions with user privileges.
- **System compromise:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised websites:** Malicious code can be injected into legitimate or compromised websites, taking advantage of the vulnerability when users visit these pages.
- **Malicious files:** Opening a malicious file could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create/host malicious content:** Attackers need the capability to create a specially crafted webpage or file that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, typically by enticing the user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file. The user must use a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing images specified using the CSS url() function.
- This issue affects Internet Explorer 11 on Windows client and server systems, including Windows 10.
- The vulnerability is not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time the bulletin was released.

This information provides more detailed technical information regarding the root cause and attack vector compared to the standard CVE description, which only states "Memory Corruption Vulnerability".
