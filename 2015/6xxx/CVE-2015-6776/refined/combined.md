We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[563930](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=563930)] CVE-2015-6787: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.7 branch (currently 4.7.80.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [**AddressSanitizer**](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [**MemorySanitizer**](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Chromium web
browser, the worst of which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **49.0.2623.87** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **49.0.2623.87** |

### Background

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer,
faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Chromium web
browser. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, obtain
sensitive information, or bypass security restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/chromium-49.0.2623.87"

```
