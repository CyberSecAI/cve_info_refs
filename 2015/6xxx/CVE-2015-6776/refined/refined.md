    "Description": "The opj_dwt_decode_1* functions in dwt.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is mishandled during a discrete wavelet transform.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds array access in the opj_dwt_decode_1* functions of OpenJPEG's dwt.c when processing crafted JPEG 2000 data during a discrete wavelet transform.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds array access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) or possibly other unspecified impacts, such as arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted JPEG 2000 data mishandled during a discrete wavelet transform.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of providing a crafted JPEG 2000 image to a vulnerable application (Chrome)."
