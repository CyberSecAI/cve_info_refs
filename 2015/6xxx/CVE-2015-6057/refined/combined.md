## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3096448)

Published: October 13, 2015 | Updated: October 16, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow information disclosure if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3096448](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3096448).

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Edge Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6057

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly discloses the contents of its memory, which could provide an attacker with information to further compromise the userâs computer.

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way certain functions handle objects in memory. Microsoft received information about this bypass through coordinated bypass disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this bypass had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Edge XSS Filter Bypass - CVE-2015-6058

A cross-site scripting (XSS) filter bypass exists in the way that Microsoft Edge disables an HTML attribute in otherwise appropriately filtered HTTP response data. The bypass could allow initially disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker could post on a website specially crafted content that is designed to exploit this bypass. The attacker would then have to convince the user to view the content on the affected website. If the user then browses to the website, the XSS filter disables HTML attributes in the specially crafted content, creating a condition that could allow malicious script to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker who successfully exploited this bypass could cause script to run on another user's system in the guise of a third-party website. Such script would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party website, and could take any action on the user's system that the third-party website was permitted to take. The bypass could only be exploited if the user clicked a hypertext link, either in an HTML email or if the user visited an attacker's website or a website containing content that is under the attackerâs control. Any systems where Microsoft Edge is used frequently, such as workstations and terminal servers, are at the most risk from this bypass.

The update addresses the bypass by preventing the XSS filter in Microsoft Edge from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes. Microsoft received information about this bypass through coordinated bypass disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this bypass had been publicly used to attack customers.
