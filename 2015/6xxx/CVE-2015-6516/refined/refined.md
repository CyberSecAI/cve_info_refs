The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6516.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `getAccounts` attribute in an HTTP POST request to the AJAX component of the sysPass software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g., extracting sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and URLs).
    - Data modification or deletion.
    - Potential complete compromise of the database and application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted HTTP POST request is sent to the `/sysPass-1.0.9/ajax/ajax_search.php` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `search` parameter, specifically designed to exploit the `getAccounts` functionality within the application's AJAX component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the sysPass application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
