**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tripwire IP360 VnE is vulnerable to a remote XML-RPC authentication bypass. This allows attackers to execute privileged commands without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass vulnerability in the XML-RPC service.
- The RPC service is exposed on the public HTTPS interface of the VnE by default and cannot be disabled.
- Insecure handling of privileged commands via the API.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote unauthenticated attackers can execute privileged commands and queries against the API.
- Attackers can enumerate all local/remote users.
- Attackers can reset passwords of any user on the system.
- Attackers can manipulate IP filter restrictions for any user.
- For systems using external authentication (e.g., LDAP), attackers can create local passwords.
- The combined attack vectors can lead to remote administrative privilege acquisition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access via the public HTTPS interface.
- Exploitation of the XML-RPC service without authentication.
- Use of specially crafted privileged commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote network access to the target system.
- Ability to craft and send malicious XML-RPC requests.
- No prior authentication is required for exploitation.
