Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an error-based SQL injection vulnerability in the email field of the login page of the FAROL web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input in the `email` field before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Error-Based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is specifically identified as error-based, meaning the attacker uses SQL injection techniques to elicit error messages which contain useful information about the database schema and data.
- **Unauthenticated:** The exploit can be performed without prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successful SQL injection can lead to more severe exploits, such as privilege escalation, data modification, or complete system compromise, depending on the database permissions and application configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `email`.
- **SQL Injection Payload:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the email field, triggering the error-based SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable page is `http://target/tkmonitor/estrutura/login/Login.actions.php?recuperar`.
- The vulnerable POST parameter is `email`.
- Example SQL injection payload is: `email=1'%20or%201=ctxsys.drithsx.sn(1,(select%20sys.stragg(distinct%20banner)%20from%20v$version))--`

**Mitigation:**
- The primary solution is to upgrade the software to a patched version that properly sanitizes or validates user input before including it in a SQL query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The application is identified as a PHP-based web application named FAROL.
- The vulnerability is rated as OWASP Top 10 A1-Injection, highlighting the severity of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
