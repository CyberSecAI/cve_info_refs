Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco TelePresence Server devices process malformed STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of malformed STUN packets leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
-  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-119) due to insufficient bounds checking or similar issue when handling STUN packets

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service. This will disrupt the device's functionality and prevent it from fulfilling its intended purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
- The attacker sends specifically crafted, malformed STUN packets to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco TelePresence Server device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software version 3.1.
- Specific vulnerable products include Cisco TelePresence Server 7010, MSE 8710, Multiparty Media 310 and 320, and TelePresence Server on Virtual Machine (VM).
- The provided CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C with a base score of 7.8 and temporal score of 6.4.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the issue, these updates are found in version 4.2(4.18) and later (depending on the particular device model).
