Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects products running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsDevices running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software are affected if SSHv2 access is configured with RSA-based user authentication and at least one user is configured with a public key.      To determine whether RSA-based user authentication is configured for SSHv2 access, use the **show running-config | begin ip ssh pubkey-chain** command and verify that the **ip ssh pubkey-chain** command is present and that at least one user is configured.      The following example shows a Cisco IOS router with SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication enabled and configured to authenticate the user *test-user*:    ```   router#show running-config | begin ip ssh pubkey-chainip ssh pubkey-chain  username test-user   key-hash ssh-rsa XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX [...]   ``` **Note**: The SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication method is enabled by default; however, the public key of a user must be manually imported to enable the functionality.    To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to **Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software** or **Cisco IOS Software**. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   !--- output truncated   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco IOS SSHv2 supports   keyboard-interactive and password-based authentication methods. The   SSHv2 Enhancements for RSA Keys feature also supports RSA-based public   key authentication for the client and the server. RSA-based user   authentication uses a private/public key pair associated with each user   for authentication.       A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) implementation of the public key authentication method of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication.   The   vulnerability is due to a flaw in the implementation of the SSHv2 public key authentication method, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system configured   for SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication using a crafted private key. The attacker must know a valid username configured for RSA-based user   authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit   this vulnerability.      A successful exploit could   allow the attacker to bypass user authentication and log in with the privileges of the user or with the privileges configured for the virtual teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the VTY line, the   attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The   attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.          This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCus73013](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus73013) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6280.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Administrators could temporarily disable the SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication until the affected system is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.   To disable SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication use the **no ip ssh server authenticate user publickey** command. Use the **show running-config | include ip ssh server** command to verify that the mitigation is applied.       When this mitigation is applied, the system will proceed to the next authentication method. By default this is keyboard-interactive.      The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication disabled:    ```   router#show running-config | include ip ssh serverno ip ssh server authenticate user publickey   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.          Cisco IOS Software Cisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication The tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.  (Example entry: 15.1(4)M2)                    For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), and [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252).

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent Network AV:Â Network  Access Complexity AC:Â High AC:Â Medium AC:Â Low  Authentication Au:Â Multiple Au:Â Single Au:Â None  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Partial C:Â Complete  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Partial I:Â Complete  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Partial A:Â Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC:Â Unconfirmed  RC:Â Uncorroborated  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) protocol implementation of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication.
Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to log in with the privileges of the user or the privileges configured for the Virtual Teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the vty line, the attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.
The attacker must know a valid username configured for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability
affects only devices configured for public key authentication method, also known as an RSA-based user authentication feature.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds for this vulnerability are not available; however administrators could temporarily disable RSA-based user authentication to avoid exploitation. This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150923-sshpk["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150923-sshpk"]
Note: The September 23, 2015, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes three Cisco Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: September 2015 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep15.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep15.html"]

This vulnerability affects products running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.
Devices running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software are affected if SSHv2 access is configured with RSA-based user authentication and at least one user is configured with a public key.
To determine whether RSA-based user authentication is configured for SSHv2 access, use the show running-config | begin ip ssh pubkey-chain command and verify that the ip ssh pubkey-chain command is present and that at least one user is configured.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS router with SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication enabled and configured to authenticate the user test-user:
router#show running-config | begin ip ssh pubkey-chain
ip ssh pubkey-chain
username test-user
key-hash ssh-rsa XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[...]
Note: The SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication method is enabled by default; however, the public key of a user must be manually imported to enable the functionality.
To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].

Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected by this vulnerability.
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
 Cisco IOS SSHv2 supports
keyboard-interactive and password-based authentication methods. The
SSHv2 Enhancements for RSA Keys feature also supports RSA-based public
key authentication for the client and the server. RSA-based user
authentication uses a private/public key pair associated with each user
for authentication.
A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) implementation of the public key authentication method of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication.
The
vulnerability is due to a flaw in the implementation of the SSHv2 public key authentication method, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system configured
for SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication using a crafted private key. The attacker must know a valid username configured for RSA-based user
authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit
this vulnerability.
A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to bypass user authentication and log in with the privileges of the user or with the privileges configured for the virtual teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the VTY line, the
attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The
attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus73013["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus73013"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6280.

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Administrators could temporarily disable the SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication until the affected system is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.
To disable SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication use the no ip ssh server authenticate user publickey command. Use the show running-config | include ip ssh server command to verify that the mitigation is applied.
When this mitigation is applied, the system will proceed to the next authentication method. By default this is keyboard-interactive.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication disabled:
router#show running-config | include ip ssh server
no ip ssh server authenticate user publickey

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Administrators could temporarily disable the SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication until the affected system is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.
To disable SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication use the no ip ssh server authenticate user publickey command. Use the show running-config | include ip ssh server command to verify that the mitigation is applied.
When this mitigation is applied, the system will proceed to the next authentication method. By default this is keyboard-interactive.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication disabled:
router#show running-config | include ip ssh server
no ip ssh server authenticate user publickey
