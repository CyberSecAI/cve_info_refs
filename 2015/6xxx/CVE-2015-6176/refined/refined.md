Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the XSS filter in Microsoft Edge incorrectly disables HTML attributes in HTTP response data. This improper disabling can allow scripts that should be blocked to run.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **XSS Filter Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass the XSS filter in Microsoft Edge. This filter is designed to prevent malicious scripts from executing within web pages, but due to incorrect handling of HTML attributes, it fails in this specific case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure.
-   **Script Execution:** An attacker can cause script to run on a user's system within the security context of a third-party website, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions as permitted by that site.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers can inject specially crafted content (designed to trigger the vulnerability) into websites.
-   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince users to view the malicious content, either through links in emails, or by visiting a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Inject Content:** Attackers need the ability to inject content into websites, either by compromising the website itself or through websites that accept user-generated content.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must use social engineering techniques to get users to view the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is rated as Moderate on Windows clients and Low on Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is addressed by preventing the XSS filter from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes in Microsoft Edge.

**Summary of CVE-2015-6176:**

The vulnerability lies in the incorrect disabling of HTML attributes by the Microsoft Edge XSS filter which allows for a bypass.  An attacker could exploit this by injecting specially crafted content onto a website, and tricking a user to visit it. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to run malicious scripts in the context of the website visited by the user, potentially leading to information disclosure.
