Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper initialization of memory addresses within the Windows Kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows fails to properly initialize memory addresses. This allows an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve the base address of the Kernel driver from a compromised process. This can be used to bypass KASLR, potentially leading to further exploitation such as code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to log on to the affected system and execute code locally.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating a memory leak when handling cursor objects, resulting in a denial-of-service by crashing 32-bit Windows 7 systems during a memmove operation while copying the cursor content from unmapped memory. This PoC also suggests a potential for leaking kernel memory. The crash occurs during a memory operation, specifically `memmove`. The content also mentions the specific conditions of the crash which is a 32-bit Windows 7 system with a screen resolution of 1024x768 and 32-bit color depth.
- The Microsoft bulletin indicates that the vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Windows handles memory addresses.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a link to the original source of the vulnerability discovery, which appears to be from Google Security Research.
