Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the application import functionality of SAP Mobile Platform 2.3. The application parses untrusted XML data, specifically `ApplicationDefinition.xml`, without proper sanitization of external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CWE-611):** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate XML parsing to include external entities. This is achieved by crafting a malicious DTD within the XML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious XML request that includes a DTD pointing to the local file.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can perform a DoS attack, potentially by using an XML entity expansion attack.
- **SMB Relay Attack:** While not directly an XXE impact, the advisory mentions the possibility of using the vulnerability in conjunction with an SMB relay attack to gain unauthorized access to other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker replaces the `ApplicationDefinition.xml` file with a malicious XML file. This file contains a crafted DTD to exploit the XXE vulnerability.
- The malicious DTD uses an external entity declaration to access local files or external resources (e.g., via HTTP).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XML request to the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to replace the `ApplicationDefinition.xml` file, which likely requires some level of authenticated access, as indicated by `Au : Authentication (Level of authentication needed to exploit) Single (S)` in the CVSS vector.
- Network access to the vulnerable SAP Mobile Platform instance.

**Additional details:**

The provided PoC demonstrates how a malicious XML payload with an external entity declaration can be used to retrieve remote content by including an external DTD. This highlights the severity of the vulnerability.
