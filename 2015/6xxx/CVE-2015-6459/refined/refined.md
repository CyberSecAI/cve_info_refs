Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **relative path traversal** issue in the `FileDownloadServlet` of GE MDS PulseNET and MDS PulseNET Enterprise Network Management Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software does not properly validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths. Specifically, by manipulating the filename parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), a remote attacker can access files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the system by crafting a malicious file path.
*  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the system by crafting a malicious file path and leveraging the read operation.
*   The file access and deletion will be performed under the context of the SYSTEM user.
*   Complete Compromise of the affected system due to the ability to read arbitrary file contents and deleting arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  Authentication is not required to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   No special privileges or authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GE MDS PulseNET and MDS PulseNET Enterprise versions 3.1.3 and all prior versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   GE has released a new version (3.1.5) to address the vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via filter ID ['19810'].
