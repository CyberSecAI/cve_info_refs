*   This could result in a complete loss of integrity of the device, as the attacker could install a compromised or malicious firmware image.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the network where the vulnerable IP phones are connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable IP phone.
*   The attacker must be able to send TFTP requests to the device.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco SPA30X Series IP Phones, Cisco SPA50X Series IP Phones, and Cisco SPA51X Series IP Phones.
*   No workarounds exist.
*   Cisco has provided software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 4.9 (Base) and 4.0 (Temporal)
*   The exploit is considered functional.
