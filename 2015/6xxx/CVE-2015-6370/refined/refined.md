Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6370

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the Management I/O (MIO) command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco Firepower 9000 devices. Specifically, the way the CLI handles command execution allows for the injection of malicious commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization in the MIO CLI, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- Insufficient input validation in the command line interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The attacker can execute arbitrary commands at the *root* privilege level on the underlying operating system.
- Complete control of the device via root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring physical or local network access to the affected device.
- Exploitation occurs through the MIO CLI of the Firepower 9000 devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid, authenticated access to the device's CLI.
- They need to be able to execute commands through the MIO CLI.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower 9000 Series release 1.1(1.160) is vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The provided CVSS score is 4.3 (Base) and 4.1 (Temporal), indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- Exploitation is considered functional, meaning that working exploit code is available.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed by Cisco.
