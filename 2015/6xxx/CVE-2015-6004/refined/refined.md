Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the "Find Device" search field and the "UniqueID" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the "Find Device" search field, allowing an unauthenticated user to inject SQL commands. Additionally, the "UniqueID" parameter in the URL is also vulnerable to SQLi.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthenticated SQLi:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries and commands on the backend database through the "Find Device" search field.
- **Authenticated SQLi:** An authenticated attacker can extract data from the application's database using the "UniqueID" parameter, potentially compromising sensitive information like password hashes.
- Complete compromise of the database associated with the WhatsUpGold application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **"Find Device" search field:**  Unauthenticated users can inject malicious SQL through this field.
- **"UniqueID" Parameter:** Authenticated attackers can inject malicious SQL via the "UniqueID" parameter in a specific URL.
  - URL example provided: `http://IPAddress/NmConsole/Reports/Workspace/Universal/General/WrFreeFormText/WrFreeFormText.asp?sUniqueID=12345&nWorkspaceType=4`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated SQLi Attack:** The attacker requires network access to the WhatsUp Gold application.
- **Authenticated SQLi Attack:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access the application before exploiting the "UniqueID" parameter.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in IPswitch WhatsUp Gold version 16.3 and possibly previous versions.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
- The vulnerability was discovered by an anonymous researcher and Rapid7.
