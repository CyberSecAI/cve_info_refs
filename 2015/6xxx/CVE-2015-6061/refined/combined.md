[1]Before installing this update, you must have update 2965218 and security update 3039779 installed. See the **Update FAQ** for more information.

[2]This update is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only.

## Update FAQ

**Why are some of the update files listed in this bulletin also denoted in the November Microsoft Office bulletin, MS15-116?**

Several of the update files listed in this bulletin, MS15-123, are also denoted in MS15-116 because of overlaps in affected software. Although the two bulletins address separate security vulnerabilities, the security updates have been consolidated where possible and appropriate. For this reason, some identical update files are present in both of these bulletins. Note that identical update files shipping with multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

**Are there any prerequisites for any of the updates offered in this bulletin for affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business)?**

Yes. Customers running affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) must first install the 2965218 update for Office 2013 released in April, 2015, and then the 3039779 security update released in May, 2015. For more information about these two prerequisite updates, see:

* [https:](https://)
* [Knowledge Base Article 3039779](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3039779)

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

## Vulnerability Information

## Server Input Validation Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6061

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Skype for Business and Microsoft Lync clients improperly sanitize specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute HTML and JavaScript content in the Skype for Business or Lync context. The attacker could use this vulnerability to open a webpage using the default browser, open another messaging session with a third party, or potentially trigger URIs that are defined by other applications on the client's system.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could invite a target user to an instant message session and then send that user a message containing specially crafted JavaScript content. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Skype for Business and Microsoft Lync clients sanitize content.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
