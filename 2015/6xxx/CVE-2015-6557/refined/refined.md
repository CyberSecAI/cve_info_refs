The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6557.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the Tivoli Storage Manager or Microsoft SQL DB user passwords in plain text within application pop-up messages and trace outputs when errors occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plain text password disclosure in error messages and trace outputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local user can potentially view the plain text passwords of users, which could allow for unauthorized access to systems or data. However, the disclosed passwords are for users who already have access through their logged in credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Viewing pop-up error messages displayed during failed backup, restore, or query operations through the GUI interface.
- Accessing application trace output when tracing is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access to the system.
- Ability to trigger a failed operation that would generate an error pop-up.
- Ability to access the application trace output.
