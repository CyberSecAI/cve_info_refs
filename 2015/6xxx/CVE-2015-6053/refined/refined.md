Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6053:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the implementation of the `ArrayBuffer.slice` method in the JScript scripting engine. By providing specially crafted parameters to this method, an attacker can read the contents of arbitrary memory locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure due to improper handling of memory access during `ArrayBuffer.slice` operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can disclose the contents of arbitrary memory locations.
- This information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious web pages or files which are viewed using vulnerable applications using the JScript scripting engine, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing the crafted parameters to the `ArrayBuffer.slice` method.
- The attacker requires the ability to host a malicious website or provide a malicious file to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects applications using the JScript scripting language on vulnerable Microsoft Windows installations.
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for clients and "Low" for servers in terms of Information Disclosure by Microsoft.
