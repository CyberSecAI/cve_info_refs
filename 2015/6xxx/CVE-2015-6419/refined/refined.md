Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center that allows an attacker to access sensitive information from the underlying operating system. The specific cause within the software is not detailed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive OS-level information.
- Insufficient Access Controls: There is an apparent lack of proper access control, which allows authenticated users to access data that they should not be permitted to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to view sensitive information from the system. This could potentially lead to further attacks if the disclosed information includes system credentials, configurations, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Authentication Required: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center to exploit this vulnerability.
- GET request: The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is related to GET requests, suggesting the attacker uses this HTTP method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the vulnerable Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center.
- The attacker needs to be able to send GET requests to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects FireSIGHT System Software releases 4.10.3, 5.2.0, 5.3.0, 5.3.1, and 5.4.0.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Base) and 5.6 (Temporal), with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C. This indicates a network-based attack, with low complexity, requiring single authentication, leading to complete confidentiality impact but no integrity or availability impact, with functional exploit code available, an official fix, and confirmed report confidence.
- There are no known workarounds available.
- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use.
