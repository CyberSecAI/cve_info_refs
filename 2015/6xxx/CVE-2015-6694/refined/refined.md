**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue related to the handling of the `fillColor` attribute in Adobe Reader DC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption: Specifically, a use-after-free condition is triggered when the `fillColor` attribute is set to a specially crafted array. This leads to a dangling pointer being reused after it has been freed.

- Remote attack: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system.
- User interaction: The user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create malicious PDF documents or websites that contain the specially crafted `fillColor` attribute.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into opening a malicious document or visiting a malicious website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and likely other Adobe products which were addressed in the same update.
