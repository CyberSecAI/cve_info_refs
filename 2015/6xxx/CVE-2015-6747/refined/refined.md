Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause stems from several design and implementation flaws within the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software, including:
    *   Use of a hard-coded account with a known password for account management across all installations.
    *   Reliance on client-side access control and auditing mechanisms, making them bypassable.
    *   Storage of private banking keys in plain text or trivially protected format within the database.
    *   Lack of encryption and tamper protection for communication between the client and the server, which allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded credentials**: The software uses a hard-coded account ("ANCO") with a static password for account management, which is the same across all installations. While this was later changed, the new password could be found via a second hardcoded account.
*   **Client-side access control**: The software performs login verification, audit logging, and account locking on the client-side only.
*   **Insecure storage of private keys**: Private keys used for banking transactions are stored in plain text or trivially protected in the SQL database.
*   **Unencrypted network communications**: All communication between the client and server is in plain text with no tamper protection.
*   **Lack of replay protection**: The software does not protect against the reuse of captured login messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access and manipulation**: Attackers can bypass permission restrictions, modify transaction records, and alter user account status.
*   **Financial fraud**: Attackers can duplicate digital banking security keys and use them to authenticate fraudulent transactions, potentially causing financial losses for user organizations.
*   **Data breaches**: Sensitive data, including private banking keys and transaction information, can be exposed.
*   **System compromise**:  An attacker can modify any record, bypass access controls, and impersonate authorized users, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system and banking operations.
*   **Undetectable economic crimes**: The vulnerabilities enable malicious actors to gain economically from the system in a way that is difficult to detect.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network sniffing**: An attacker can eavesdrop on network traffic to capture credentials and sensitive banking information, due to the lack of encryption.
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks**: Attackers positioned on the network can intercept and modify communications between the client and server.
*   **Direct database access**: Attackers with access to the database, either via compromised user credentials or via SQL injection, can directly access and modify sensitive data.
*   **Replay attacks**: Captured login messages can be replayed to gain unauthorized access to the banking server.
*   **Client-side manipulation**: By disrupting network traffic related to security functions, attackers can prevent client-side access controls from being enforced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access**: Attackers need to be able to intercept network traffic (for network sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks), which may be local network access or access via compromised systems.
*   **Database access**: Attackers may need access to the database to directly retrieve private keys or to manipulate user accounts and transaction records. This could be achieved through compromised user accounts, SQL injection vulnerabilities, or direct access to the database server.
*   **Local system access**: Attackers may need access to systems running the client or server software to manipulate the client-side controls.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were initially reported in 2012 but remained unpatched or inadequately addressed for a prolonged period.
*   The vendor was made aware of the issues and demonstrated exploits to both the vendor and CERT-FI.
*   The affected software was used by 1,500 to 2,000 organizations, primarily in Nordic and Baltic countries.
*   The impact could extend beyond the organizations using the software, depending on how banking processes are defined in each bank.
