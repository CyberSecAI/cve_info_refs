Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `CBSharedReviewSecurityDialog` method in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
*   It's caused by insufficient restrictions on the Javascript API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Javascript API Restriction Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass the intended security restrictions of the Javascript API.
*   Specifically, the advisory mentions "By creating a specially crafted PDF with specific Javascript instructions". This implies a vulnerability in the way the application validates or handles specific JavaScript instructions used within PDF documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This means an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the affected machine.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*  **User Interaction Required:** The user must interact with a malicious file or web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF document containing specially crafted JavaScript code.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when visited by a user with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader DC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Content:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious PDF or web page containing the specific exploit code.
*   **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious PDF or entice the user to visit the malicious web page. This could be through email, file sharing, or other methods.
*   **Target Must Open Malicious Content:** The target user needs to open the malicious PDF or visit the malicious page while using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
*   The advisory indicates that Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID.
*   Adobe released an update to address this vulnerability (and others).

In summary, CVE-2015-6721 is a critical vulnerability that can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine via a malicious PDF file or web page, by bypassing restrictions on the javascript API within the `CBSharedReviewSecurityDialog` method. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
