Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a result of insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the "event_location[address][]" parameter when creating a calendar event. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and persistently store malicious JavaScript code. This code executes within the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected calendar event. This can lead to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Data theft
    * Malicious redirects
    * Defacement of the website
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/calendar/submit/` endpoint when creating a calendar event.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability with minimal privileges, as even a non-registered user can trigger it. The attacker needs to be able to submit a POST request to the forum's calendar submission endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
*   The vendor was notified on 2015-07-27, and a fix was released on 2015-08-05 in version 4.0.12.1.
