Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation of the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS). Specifically, there's a lack of sufficient protection for URLs related to dashboard portlets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core weakness is that the RBAC system does not properly restrict access to certain URLs related to dashboard portlets. This allows an authenticated user, who should not have the privileges, to modify them.
- **CWE-264:** This maps to the broader category of "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls" which aligns with the root cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** An attacker could modify dashboard portlets. This modification could range from simply changing the visual elements to potentially altering displayed information, which affects the integrity of the system.
- **No Confidentiality or Availability Impact:** The exploit doesn't lead to data breaches of confidential information or cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the affected device.
- **Network:** The attack can be executed over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the Cisco ACS system.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cisco ACS to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
