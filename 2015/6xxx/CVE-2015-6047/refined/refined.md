Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-6047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists within the `EditWith` functionality of the broker process for Internet Explorer. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because code running in the AppContainer can use the DelegateExecute functionality of shell execution to execute arbitrary applications in the context of the user. This bypasses the intended restriction that only applications in the Internet Explorer allowed list should be executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation within Internet Explorer.
- Ability for code running in the AppContainer to utilize `DelegateExecute` to run arbitrary applications outside the allowed list.
- An elevation of privilege vulnerability, where a script can potentially be run with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escape the Application Container and execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-in user.
- This grants the attacker the same user rights as the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- The vulnerability, when combined with another vulnerability like remote code execution, could allow the execution of arbitrary code at the medium integrity level (permissions of the current user), bypassing restrictions that may force low integrity level execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted webpage.
- The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. User interaction is required.
- Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content by embedding malicious content designed to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create and host a malicious webpage or file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- They need to convince a user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by clicking a link or opening an attachment).
- The attacker must target a system running a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
