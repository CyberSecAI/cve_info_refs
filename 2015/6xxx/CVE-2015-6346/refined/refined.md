Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6346

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Document Object Model (DOM)-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the web interface of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-based XSS (CWE-79):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the client-side DOM, leading to the execution of the script within the user's browser. This type of XSS typically doesn't involve server-side injection, making it harder to detect and prevent using traditional XSS mitigation techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to modify the behavior or appearance of the web interface as seen by the user, potentially leading to actions taken by the user that they did not intend to take.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely.
- **Unauthenticated:**  The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable web interface of the Cisco Secure ACS. They do not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Secure ACS release 5.7(0.15).
- No workarounds are available.
-  The CVSS base score is 4.3 and the temporal score is 4.1, indicating a moderate level of severity.
-  There is no information about public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability
