{
  "CVE-2015-6836": {
    "Description": "A type confusion occurs within SOAP serialize_function_call due to an insufficient validation of the headers field. In the SoapClient's __call method, the verify_soap_headers_array check is applied only to headers retrieved from zend_parse_parameters; problem is that a few lines later, soap_headers could be updated or even replaced with values from the __default_headers object fields.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient validation of the headers field in SOAP serialize\_function\_call leading to type confusion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type Confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to the ability to control the obj.handlers pointer in PHP7, and a memory corruption that can lead to arbitrary code execution in PHP5",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafting a specific SOAP request with malicious headers.",
       "Unserializing a specifically crafted object."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the PHP application. This can be done remotely."
