Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ICMP implementation of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch. Specifically, it is related to the handling of ICMP record route packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of ICMP record route packets. This leads to a condition where the switch can be forced to reload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The switch reloads, causing an interruption to network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can send malicious ICMP record route packets to the vulnerable switch from anywhere on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to authenticate.
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets, specifically crafted ICMP packets, to the vulnerable switch.
- The attacker does not need a specific position within the network, other than having connectivity to the target switch.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switches running software versions prior to release 11.0(1c).
- A workaround exists, which involves dropping all ICMP packets. However, it should only be applied in cases where the switch is under attack and the workaround requires coordination with Cisco TAC.
- The fix is available in software version 11.0(1c) and later.
- The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploits or malicious activity related to this vulnerability.
