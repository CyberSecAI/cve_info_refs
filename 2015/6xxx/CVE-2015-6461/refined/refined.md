{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Modicon PLC web server has improper input validation, allowing for crafted URLs to redirect the client browser to a remote file or execute JavaScript.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Improper control of filename for include/require statement in PHP program.",
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Improper neutralization of input during web page generation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can redirect the client browser to a remote file or execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the PLC's web interface.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted URLs targeting the PLC's web server. The exploit requires a local user to click the crafted link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs knowledge of the PLC's IP address. The attacker must also use social engineering to induce a local user with HTTP access to click the crafted link."
