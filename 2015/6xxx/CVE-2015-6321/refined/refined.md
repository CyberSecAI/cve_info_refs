Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the network stack of Cisco AsyncOS. Specifically, it's due to a flaw that allows an attacker to exhaust available memory on the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to exhaust the system's memory through a specific type of attack.
*   **TCP Connection Handling:**  The vulnerability causes the affected device to be unable to accept new TCP connections, as the memory is consumed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The affected device becomes unresponsive and cannot accept new TCP connections, effectively disrupting its normal functionality.
*   **Service Interruption:** The DoS condition can interrupt services provided by the affected Cisco devices, including email security, content security management, and web security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any form of authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco device.
*   **No Credentials:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send network traffic:** The attacker must have the ability to send TCP packets to the target.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)
*   Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)
*   Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)

These appliances are affected when running vulnerable versions of Cisco AsyncOS software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-399, which refers to "Resource Management Errors."
*   The CVSS base score is 7.1, and the temporal score is 5.9. The vector string is `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, and the recommended solution is to upgrade to a fixed software version.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of customer cases.
