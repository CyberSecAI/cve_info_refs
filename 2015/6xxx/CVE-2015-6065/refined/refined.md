Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6065

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a double-free condition within the handling of `CAttrValue` objects in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Specifically, the issue occurs due to improper memory management when manipulating document elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The core issue is a double-free vulnerability, where memory allocated for a `CAttrValue` object is freed twice. This leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains control of the affected system.
- **Control Over System:** Attackers could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the double-free condition when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised or user-content-hosting websites, exploiting the vulnerability through user interaction.
- **Malicious Files:**  Users could be tricked into opening a malicious file containing the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can be remote and do not need physical access to the target system.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- **Crafted Malicious Content:** Attackers need to create or inject content that triggers the double-free condition.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  Attackers need an understanding of how to trigger the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

**Additional details from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI):**
- The vulnerability exists within the usage of `CAttrValue` objects.
- Manipulating a document's elements can force a double-free condition.
- The exploit can execute code under the context of the current process.
- ZDI identified this vulnerability as **ZDI-16-229** and **ZDI-CAN-3366**.

**Microsoft's Description:**
-  The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**Affected Software:**
- Internet Explorer versions 9, 10 and 11 on Windows client and server operating systems

**Severity:**
- Critical on Windows client operating systems.
- Moderate on Windows server operating systems
