Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-6396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the command-line interface (CLI) command parser of the affected Cisco routers. Specifically, the parser does not properly sanitize input, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  An authenticated, local attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands via the CLI.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The CLI command parser fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The injected shell commands are executed on the device with full administrator privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** This allows an attacker to potentially gain complete control of the affected device, allowing for activities like data exfiltration, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the CLI of the device. The web interface also provides access to the CLI through a local LAN connection or through remote management if the remote management feature is enabled.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local area network (LAN) as the target device or have remote management access if enabled.
- **Authentication:** Attacker needs valid user credentials to access the CLI.
- **Knowledge of Cisco Router CLI**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and inject malicious commands via the device's CLI.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:
  - RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
  - RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
  - RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router
- The provided exploit script from Exploit-DB demonstrates a method to extract credentials, obtain a session ID and then execute OS commands via the "diagnose command" parameter. This script leverages a different, unauthenticated vulnerability to extract the necessary credentials but the command injection is still present.

The content from Cisco's security advisory (tools.cisco.com) provides the most direct information about the vulnerability itself, while the exploit-db content shows the vulnerability in practical exploitation with a python script. The information on sec.cloudapps.cisco.com shows a CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability.
