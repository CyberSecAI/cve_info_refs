The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6946. It describes three distinct stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the Borland AccuRev Reprise License Server. All three vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely without authentication and allow for arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `activate_doit` function.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `akey` parameter leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Network-based, unauthenticated.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required; attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `service_startup_doit` functionality.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `licfile` parameter leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*  **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Network-based, unauthenticated.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required; attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `activate_doit` function.
*  **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `actserver` parameter leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Network-based, unauthenticated.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required; attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.

**Additional details:**

*   All three vulnerabilities were disclosed as 0-day due to the vendor's lack of response within the ZDI's 120-day deadline.
*   The advisory suggests restricting interaction with the service to trusted machines using firewall rules/whitelisting as a mitigation strategy.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by specific Digital Vaccine filters.
