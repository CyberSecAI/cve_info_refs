## (0Day) Borland AccuRev Reprise License Server activate\_doit Command akey Parameter Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-412ZDI-CAN-3032

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-6946](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6946) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.3, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Borland](http://www.borland.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [AccuRev](http://www.borland.com/Products/Change-Management/AccuRev) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['20180']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a stack buffer overflow in the Reprise License Management service on installations of Borland AccuRev. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the activate\_doit function of the service. The issue lies in the handling of the akey parameter which can result in overflowing a stack-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  07/09/2015 - ZDI emailed vendor and requested contact 07/28/2015 - ZDI emailed vendor and requested contact 08/13/2015 - ZDI emailed vendor and requested contact 08/21/2015 - ZDI emailed vendor and requested contact08/24/2015 - A vendor representative replied and attempted to direct ZDI to a sales rep08/24/2015 - ZDI replied again that we needed to report a security bug08/24/2015 - The vendor asked for a serial number or account code to open a support case08/24/2015 - ZDI replied that we "don't have that, no. But if you have a contact (and he or she should have a PGP key for encryption), then I am very happy to provide the report."08/24/2015 - The vendor replied that they could not find a license to open a support case08/24/2015 - ZDI replied that "We are a software security research organization... Our concern is not for ourselves - we want to report a flaw in your software that is leaving potentially all of the customers of this product vulnerable to exploitation."08/25/2015 - The vendor replied, "Thank you, I appreciate the clarification. I'm sorry but this is something that would be worked on internally. "08/31/2015 - ZDI notified the vendor of intent to publish as 0-day  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |
