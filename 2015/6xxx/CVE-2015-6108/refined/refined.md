Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of specially crafted embedded fonts by the Windows font library. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that arises when the Windows font library processes maliciously crafted embedded fonts.
-   The vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows, .NET Framework, Microsoft Office, Skype for Business, Microsoft Lync and Silverlight.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution. This means an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
-   **Full User Rights:** Upon successful exploitation, attackers can gain the same level of access as the current user, including the ability to:
    -   Install programs
    -   View, change, or delete data
    -   Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Specially Crafted Documents:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious documents (e.g., Office documents) containing embedded fonts designed to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Malicious Webpages:** Attackers can embed malicious fonts in webpages. Visiting such a page can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to either:
    -   Open a specially crafted document.
    -   Visit a website containing specially crafted embedded fonts.
-   **No Special Position:** The attacker does not need a specific position on the network, the attack can be conducted remotely.
