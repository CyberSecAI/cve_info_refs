Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in a CGI script within Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager and Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliances.
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation that allows for the execution of arbitrary commands

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw (CWE-78), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Because arbitrary commands can be run, the attacker could achieve full control of the affected system, including the ability to modify configurations, steal data, install malware, and cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco UCS Manager or Cisco Firepower 9000 Series appliance.
