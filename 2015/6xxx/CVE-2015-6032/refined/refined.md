Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Qolsys IQ Panel contains hard-coded cryptographic keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:**  The device uses cryptographic keys that are embedded directly in the firmware, rather than being generated or stored securely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers who obtain these hard-coded keys can sign malicious code, making it appear valid to the affected devices. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code and compromise the device's security and functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to obtain the hard-coded cryptographic keys. This could potentially be achieved through reverse engineering the firmware or by other means.
- Once the attacker has the keys, they can craft malicious software updates that appear to be legitimately signed.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious update to the target device (remotely or through physical access).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the hard-coded cryptographic keys used by the Qolsys IQ Panel.
- The ability to craft malicious software updates.
- A method to deliver the malicious update to the target device, such as through network access or by tricking a user into manually installing it.
