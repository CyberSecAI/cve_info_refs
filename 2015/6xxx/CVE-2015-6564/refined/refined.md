Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6564:

**1. seclists.org_e0cd0ede_20250124_183108.html**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free in the `mm_answer_pam_free_ctx` function within the PAM privilege separation code of OpenSSH.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**:
    *   Improper memory management: The PAM context is freed by `sshpam_free_ctx`, but other PAM related monitor requests can still access the freed memory leading to use-after-free.
    *   Lack of sufficient checks: Although a `MON_ONCE` flag exists to prevent double frees on `MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX`, other PAM-related requests can still be sent after the context is freed.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Potential privilege escalation: A compromised child process can free the PAM context and then use other PAM requests. This might allow the attacker to manipulate the authentication process by replacing the freed memory with a fake structure, potentially allowing any user to authenticate without a password.
    *   Denial of service: Triggering the vulnerability may lead to memory corruption and application crashes.
*   **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker who has already achieved code execution in the unprivileged pre-auth sandbox process can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Remote code execution within the unprivileged pre-auth sandbox process
    *   Ability to send crafted monitor requests to the monitor process

*   This document lists CVE-2015-6564 as one of many vulnerabilities in OpenSSH, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4.
*   States it is a "Use-after-free vulnerability in the `mm_answer_pam_free_ctx` function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early `MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX` request."
*   It includes the attack vector as local with a high complexity, no privileges required and a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**4.  www.broadcom.com_8db22264_20250124_183123.html**

*   This document identifies the vulnerability in Brocade Fabric OS and confirms that the component is openssh.
*   It describes the vulnerability as a "Use-after-free vulnerability in the mm\_answer\_pam\_free\_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR\_REQ\_PAM\_FREE\_CTX request."
*   It rates the severity as low with a CVSS base score of 4.0.

**5.  www.openssh.com_95e28662_20250124_183109.html**
*   The OpenSSH release notes highlight that a "use-after-free bug related to PAM support" was fixed in portable versions and it was "reachable by attackers who could compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code execution."

**6.  security.gentoo.org_58d136e3_20250124_183121.html**
*   Gentoo's security advisory lists CVE-2015-6564 as a vulnerability in OpenSSH. It indicates that this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service condition.
*   It also mentions this is a remote exploitable vulnerability, it is exploitable, and has a 'normal' severity.

**7.  www.openwall.com_9ba4ba66_20250124_183109.html**
*   This is an email from MITRE assigning the CVE ID. It confirms that CVE-2015-6564 is for "a use-after-free bug related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code execution".

**8. www.suse.com_051de9df_20250126_024803.html**
*   This page identifies the vulnerability, rating the severity as moderate, and the CVSS v2 base score as 1.9 (local access, medium complexity, no authentication, partial integrity impact).
*   It also specifies that the vulnerable function is mm_answer_pam_free_ctx in OpenSSH before 7.0. 
*   It mentions fixed package versions in various SUSE products.

**9.  www.redhat.com_87c1cf24_20250126_024809.html**
* This Red Hat Errata describes the issue as "A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root privileges."

**10. lists.debian.org_3c86b23e_20250124_183121.html**
*   This document describes that  "Moritz Jodeit discovered a use-after-free flaw in PAM support in OpenSSH, that could be used by remote attackers to bypass authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code."

**11. github.com_7f831470_20250126_024749.html**
*   This is the commit that fixes the use-after-free. The commit description reads "Avoids use-after-free in monitor when privsep child is compromised. Reported by Moritz Jodeit."
*   The actual fix is that after calling `free_ctx` the pointer to the freed memory `sshpam_ctxt` is set to NULL, preventing future use of freed memory.

**12. www.suse.com_bc84edea_20250126_024802.html**
*   SUSE's CVE entry for CVE-2015-6564 describes it as "Use-after-free vulnerability in the mm\_answer\_pam\_free\_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR\_REQ\_PAM\_FREE\_CTX request."
*   They rate the severity as moderate with a CVSS v2 score of 6.9. It also lists bugzilla entries and advisory links, and fixed versions.

**Summary**

*   **Root Cause**: Use-after-free vulnerability in OpenSSH's PAM privilege separation code, specifically within the `mm_answer_pam_free_ctx` function.
*   **Vulnerabilities**:
    *   Improper memory management with freeing PAM context prematurely.
    *   Lack of proper input validation and ordering of authentication-related requests, specifically regarding the `MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX` request.
*   **Impact**: Remote attackers achieving code execution in the unprivileged pre-auth process can cause a denial of service, or potentially gain privilege escalation.
*   **Attack Vector**: Requires a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution in the unprivileged pre-auth process, and then sending specific crafted monitor requests.
*   **Required Capabilities**: Ability to compromise the unprivileged pre-auth sandbox process and subsequently send crafted monitor requests.

This vulnerability was addressed in OpenSSH 7.0.
