________________________________________________________________________________

Affected Product:       OpenSSH (<http://www.openssh.com>)
Affected Version:       Portable versions <= 6.9p1
Vulnerability:          Vulnerabilities in PAM Privilege Separation Code
________________________________________________________________________________

I.   Impact

Two vulnerabilities were identified in the PAM privilege separation code. One
of them (III) allows remote attackers who previously achieved remote code
execution within the unprivileged pre-auth sandbox process to perform a
successful authentication as an arbitrary user (e.g. root) and thus impersonate
other users. The only additional prerequisite is any valid (possibly
low-privileged) user account which can be used to login into the system via SSH.

________________________________________________________________________________

II.  Background

OpenSSH implements privilege separation which was introduced with version 5.9.
Privilege separation is a generic approach which splits the code into two
processes: An unprivileged child process and a privileged monitor process. The
unprivileged child does most of the work and in particular processes all the
network data. The monitor process communicates with the unprivileged child
process and performs all the operations which require higher privileges. The
idea of this design is to prevent programming errors in the unprivileged parts
from compromising the whole application and thus prevent a full system
compromise. A good technical overview can be found in the paper
"Preventing Privilege Escalation" by Niels Provos et al.
(<http://www.peter.honeyman.org/u/provos/papers/privsep.pdf>).

The unprivileged child process and privileged monitor process communicate via
a socketpair. Several different monitor request and answer types are defined
which can be used to exchange messages between the two processes. The complete
list can be found in the mon_dispatch_proto{15,20} and
mon_dispatch_postauth{15,20} structures defined in monitor.c.

Monitor requests have certain flags assigned which can restrict when and how
requests are accepted by the monitor. E.g. the flag MON_ONCE determines that
a request can only be sent once and is disabled after it was received for the
first time in the monitor. The MON_AUTH flag determines that a request is
related to the authentication process. The complete list of flags can be found
in the monitor.c file as well.

Not all defined requests are permitted in every state of the SSH protocol. In
order to control which requests are permitted, the functions monitor_permit()
and monitor_permit_authentications() are used. The function monitor_permit()
can be used to enable or disable a certain message while the function
monitor_permit_authentications() enables or disables all authentication
related messages which have the MON_AUTH flag set. When a request is received
by the monitor which is currently not allowed the monitor process terminates
by calling the fatal() function.

________________________________________________________________________________

III. PAM Authentication Bypass in Privilege Separation

When PAM support is enabled in the portable version of OpenSSH, a few additonal
monitor requests are enabled which can be found in the monitor.c file:

#ifdef USE_PAM
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_START, MON_ONCE, mm_answer_pam_start},
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_ACCOUNT, 0, mm_answer_pam_account},
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX, MON_ISAUTH, mm_answer_pam_init_ctx},
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_QUERY, MON_ISAUTH, mm_answer_pam_query},
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_RESPOND, MON_ISAUTH, mm_answer_pam_respond},
    {MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX, MON_ONCE|MON_AUTHDECIDE, mm_answer_pam_free_ctx},
#endif

Before any PAM-related monitor requests are sent, the unprivileged child process
sends the MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request to verify that the username received from
the network represents a valid user. The monitor responds with the corresponding
passwd struct entry if the user exists and additionally caches the username
and passwd struct entry in the current monitor authentication context
(struct Authctxt *authctxt).

PAM authentication then starts with the unprivileged child process sending the
MONITOR_REQ_PAM_START request which tells the monitor to open a new
authentication transaction for the current user by calling the PAM API function
pam_start().

The next PAM-related monitor request sent by the child process is
MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX which initializes [2] the current PAM authentication
context in the monitor.

int
mm_answer_pam_init_ctx(int sock, Buffer *m)
{

        debug3("%s", __func__);
        authctxt->user = buffer_get_string(m, NULL);                    [1]
        sshpam_ctxt = (sshpam_device.init_ctx)(authctxt);               [2]
        sshpam_authok = NULL;
        buffer_clear(m);
[...]

Interestingly the child process sends the current username as part of this
request once again to the monitor and the monitor overwrites the previously
stored username in the monitor authentication context with the received
username [1].

During a normal PAM authentication the same username is sent, so this doesn't
represent a problem. However an attacker who already compromised the
unprivileged pre-auth child process could send a different username in this
case. This could lead to a situation where the username stored in the monitor
authentication context would not match the stored passwd struct entry.

The remaining PAM authentication only relies on the stored username. The user
which is actually logged in after a successful authentication is on the contrary
only identified by the stored passwd struct entry.

This allows an attacker who compromised the unprivileged child process to first
send any desired username (e.g. root) with the MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request which
would store the corresponding passwd struct entry in the authentication context.
Subsequently he would send a different username for whom he's in posession of
the password and perform a valid PAM authentication with that user. Once the
authentication was successful, the attacker is not logged in with the user he
used for the authentication, but with the username he specified in the initial
MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request.

________________________________________________________________________________

IV.  Use-After-Free in PAM Privilege Separation

The monitor requests for PAM authentication which can be send by the
unprivileged child process represent additional attack surface. But not only
implementation flaws in the handlers have to be considered. Also the order in
which requests are send could result in unexpected program states and thus lead
to interesting vulnerabilities.

One such vulnerability can be found in the handler for the
MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request:

int
mm_answer_pam_free_ctx(int sock, Buffer *m)
{

        debug3("%s", __func__);
        (sshpam_device.free_ctx)(sshpam_ctxt);                          [3]
        buffer_clear(m);
        mm_request_send(sock, MONITOR_ANS_PAM_FREE_CTX, m);
        auth_method = "keyboard-interactive";
        auth_submethod = "pam";
        return (sshpam_authok == sshpam_ctxt);
}

At [3] the free_ctx function pointer of the KbdintDevice structure is called
which is set to sshpam_free_ctx(). That function can be found in auth-pam.c:

static void
sshpam_free_ctx(void *ctxtp)
{
        struct pam_ctxt *ctxt = ctxtp;

        debug3("PAM: %s entering", __func__);
        sshpam_thread_cleanup();
        free(ctxt);                                                     [4]
        /*
         * We don't call sshpam_cleanup() here because we may need the PAM
         * handle at a later stage, e.g. when setting up a session.  It's
         * still on the cleanup list, so pam_end() *will* be called before
         * the server process terminates.
         */
}

As can be seen this frees the current PAM context memory pointed to by the
passed sshpam_ctxt pointer [4]. The flag MON_ONCE is set for the
MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX monitor request which prevents a malicious child
process from calling it multiple times which would otherwise lead to an obvious
double free vulnerability.

However it is still possible for a compromised child process to first send the
MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request which will free the PAM context and then use
any of the other PAM monitor requests which leads to a use-after-free condition.

The freed structure is defined in auth-pam.c as follows:

struct pam_ctxt {
        sp_pthread_t     pam_thread;
        int              pam_psock;
        int              pam_csock;
        int              pam_done;
};

As can be seen the structure does not contain any pointers or length fields
which would be ideal candidates for the exploitation of this use-after-free bug.
However it stores two other interesting values, which are the pam_psock and
pam_csock file descriptors. These file descriptors identify the receiving and
sending socket to the PAM authentication system respectively.

In order to exploit the use-after-free condition, you could try to replace the
freed memory in the monitor process with a fake structure which would have
pam_psocks and pam_csock being set to the file descriptors used for the
communication with the unprivileged child process.

This way the monitor would send all PAM authentication requests directly to the
unprivileged child process which could then impersonate the PAM subsystem and
e.g. allow authentication for any user without a password.

The problem which most probably prevents the described way of exploitation is
that only monitor requests which have the MON_AUTHDECIDE flag set are allowed
to make an authentication decision:

                        if (!(ent->flags & MON_AUTHDECIDE))
                                fatal("%s: unexpected authentication from %d",
                                    __func__, ent->type);

For PAM only the MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request has this flag set.
Additionally the request has the MON_ONCE flag set which means we can send it to
the monitor only a single time. Since we initially need to send this request to
trigger the freeing of the PAM context, followed by other monitor requests for
the actual authentication, we are running into the described MON_AUTHDECIDE
check which prevents a successful authentication.

We didn't find a way to successfully exploit this use-after-free condition for
anything interesting. But a creative mind might eventually find a useful
scenario.

V.   Mitigation

Both vulnerabilities were fixed in OpenSSH 7.0 which should be installed to
resolve the issues.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local
users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to
the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

=== Content from www.openssh.com_95e28662_20250124_183109.html ===
OpenSSH 7.0 was released on 2015-08-11. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in the next release
including:
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
\* Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
for AES.
\* MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.1 when it is released.
Changes since OpenSSH 6.9
=========================
This focus of this release is primarily to deprecate weak, legacy
and/or unsafe cryptography.
Security
--------
\* sshd(8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-
writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages
to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.
Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.
\* sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could successfully
compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
impersonate other users. Reported by Moritz Jodeit.
\* sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could
compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.
\* sshd(8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request
the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in
a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in sshd(8) and any
authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication
mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.
Potentially-incompatible Changes
--------------------------------
\* Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
default at compile time.
\* Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
\* Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-\* host and user keys is disabled
by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
\* Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
\* The default for the sshd\_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
\* PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
were enabled).
New Features
------------
\* ssh\_config(5): add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes option to control which
public key types are available for user authentication.
\* sshd\_config(5): add HostKeyAlgorithms option to control which
public key types are offered for host authentications.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): extend Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgorithms,
HostKeyAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and HostbasedKeyTypes
options to allow appending to the default set of algorithms
instead of replacing it. Options may now be prefixed with a '+'
to append to the default, e.g. "HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss".
\* sshd\_config(5): PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of
'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-
password'.
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): add compatability workarounds for Cisco and more
PuTTY versions. bz#2424
\* Fix some omissions and errors in the PROTOCOL and PROTOCOL.mux
documentation relating to Unix domain socket forwarding;
bz#2421 bz#2422
\* ssh(1): Improve the ssh(1) manual page to include a better
description of Unix domain socket forwarding; bz#2423
\* ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): skip uninitialised PKCS#11 slots, fixing
failures to load keys when they are present. bz#2427
\* ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): do not ignore PKCS#11 hosted keys that wth
empty CKA\_ID; bz#2429
\* sshd(8): clarify documentation for UseDNS option; bz#2045
Portable OpenSSH
----------------
\* Check realpath(3) behaviour matches what sftp-server requires and
use a replacement if necessary.
Checksums:
==========
- SHA1 (openssh-7.0.tar.gz) = a19ff0bad2a67348b1d01a38a9580236120b7099
- SHA256 (openssh-7.0.tar.gz) = 4F6HV/ZqT465f3sMB2vIkXO+wrYtL5hnqzAymfbZ1Jk=
- SHA1 (openssh-7.0p1.tar.gz) = d8337c9eab91d360d104f6dd805f8b32089c063c
- SHA256 (openssh-7.0p1.tar.gz) = /VkySToZ9MgRU9gS7k4EK0m707dZqz2TRKvswrwUheU=
Please note that the PGP key used to sign releases was recently rotated.
The new key has been signed by the old key to provide continuity. It is
available from the mirror sites as RELEASE\_KEY.asc.
Reporting Bugs:
===============
- Please read http://www.openssh.com/report.html
Security bugs should be reported directly to openssh@openssh.com
OpenSSH is brought to you by Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
Kevin Steves, Damien Miller, Darren Tucker, Jason McIntyre, Tim Rice and
Ben Lindstrom.

# CVE-2015-5600

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-5590.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-5602.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-5600 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5600)

#### Description

The kbdint\_next\_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.

Subject: Re: CVE request - OpenSSH 6.9 PAM privilege separation vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

>> <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0>

>> Attackers who could successfully compromise the pre-authentication
>> process for remote code execution

As far as we know, what this means is that the attacker has the
ability to execute arbitrary code (or, specific unintended pieces of
code) with the uid of the sshd account. During a normal
pre-authentication phase, some code runs with this uid, and other code
runs as root. The phrase "pre-authentication process" is potentially
ambiguous, i.e., it could mean either "the sequence of steps that
occur during the pre-authentication phase" or "the UNIX process that
is intentionally running with the sshd uid."

We don't understand why "for remote code execution" was mentioned. A
case where a local attacker, who has access only to the sshd uid, can
exploit a bug in the monitor component seems completely relevant for
purposes of CVE.

In other words, we think the CVE IDs below apply to two types of
threat models: either there is a security-relevant bug in the code
that runs with the sshd uid, or the attacker happens to have access to
the sshd uid for a reason unrelated to the OpenSSH source code (e.g.,
administrative error). In the former case, there would be a separate
CVE ID for any such bug.

>>  * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation

>>    compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
>>    execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
>>    impersonate other users.  Reported by Moritz Jodeit.

> The user impersonation issue was fixed by the following commit:

> <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/d4697fe9a28dab7255c60433e4dd23cf7fce8a8b>

Use CVE-2015-6563.

> <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/5e75f5198769056089fb06c4d738ab0e5abc66f7>

Use CVE-2015-6564.

Use CVE-2015-6565.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=903649#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-11-03 10:27:37 UTC  ``` <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Oct/35>  Quote: "OpenSSH lets you grant SFTP access to users without allowing full command execution using "ForceCommand internal-sftp". However, if you misconfigure the server and don't use ChrootDirectory, the user will be able to access all parts of the filesystem that he has access to - including procfs. On modern Linux kernels (>=3D2.6.39, I think), /proc/self/maps reveals the memory layout and /proc/self/mem lets you write to arbitrary memory positions. Combine those and you get easy RCE."  It involves a number of issues coming together, however in the end it is an RCE with a legit configuration.  Changelog: <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.7>  * sftp-server(8): On platforms that support it, use prctl() to    prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}  as there seems to be a mitigation patch we could include it in the next online update for openssh. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=903649#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-03 23:00:17 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=903649#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-07-15 15:53:29 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 6 fixes is
now available.
Description:
openssh was updated to fix several security issues and bugs.
These security issues were fixed:
\* CVE-2015-5352: The x11\_open\_helper function in channels.c in ssh in
OpenSSH when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacked a check of the
refusal deadline for X connections, which made it easier for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside
of the permitted time window (bsc#936695).
\* CVE-2015-5600: The kbdint\_next\_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd
in OpenSSH did not properly restrict the processing of
keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which made it
easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a
denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in
the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified
client that provides a different password for each pam element on this
list (bsc#938746).
\* CVE-2015-4000: Removed and disabled weak DH groups to address LOGJAM
(bsc#932483).
\* Hardening patch to fix sftp RCE (bsc#903649).
\* CVE-2015-6563: The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH accepted
extraneous username data in MONITOR\_REQ\_PAM\_INIT\_CTX requests, which
allowed local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any
SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a
crafted MONITOR\_REQ\_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and
monitor\_wrap.c.
\* CVE-2015-6564: Use-after-free vulnerability in the
mm\_answer\_pam\_free\_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH might
have allowed local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the
sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR\_REQ\_PAM\_FREE\_CTX request.
These non-security issues were fixed:
- bsc#914309: sshd inherits oom\_adj -17 on SIGHUP causing DoS potential
for oom\_killer.
- bsc#673532: limits.conf fsize change in SLES10SP3 causing problems to
WebSphere mqm user.
- bsc#916549: Fixed support for aesXXX-gcm@openssh.com.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:48:58 UTC  ``` It was discovered that OpenSSH client did not correctly handle situations when untrusted X11 forwarding was requested and generation of the untrusted authentication cookie failed.  The ssh client continued by generating fake authentication cookie and allowed remote X clients to connect the local X server.  The decision if client connection was accepted was delegated to the X server which, depending on its configuration, could allow clients to open trusted X connection.  This would lead to remote X clients having more privileged access to the local X server than intended.  This problem can occur when X server does not include or enable X Security extension (for X.org X server, this extension is not compiled in by default since 2007) and when it has authentication methods besides MIT cookies enabled (e.g. localuser authentication allowing all X connections from a local user who owns the X session).  Both of these conditions are satisfied on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and current Fedora versions.  The X server does not have X Security extension compiled in and 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' is run from the xinit scripts.  Therefore remote X clients are granted trusted access to the local X server when 'ssh -X' is used, as if 'ssh -Y' was actually used.  The X server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes X Security extension (as of RHSA-2013:1620 - <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1620.html> - which was released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5) and hence does not fall back to the use of fake authentication cookie.  This issue was corrected upstream in version 7.1p2:  <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1p2>  Upstream commit:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=ed4ce82dbfa8a3a3c8ea6fa0db113c71e234416c>  which needs to be applied after:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=f98a09cacff7baad8748c9aa217afd155a4d493f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:50:43 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported upstream in Oct 2015 and the fix was waiting for inclusion in the next OpenSSH upstream release.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c4)  Jakub Jelen    2016-01-15 07:48:06 UTC  ``` Actually, openssh-7.1p2 does not fix this issue and it will be as part of the next release. There was a bug in release notes:  <http://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2016-January/034684.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 07:57:02 UTC  ``` Thank you for pointing that error out!   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 09:08:58 UTC  ```  Created openssh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1298840](show_bug.cgi?id=1298840 "CLOSED ERRATA - openssh: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 09:09:04 UTC  ```  Created gsi-openssh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1298841](show_bug.cgi?id=1298841 "CLOSED ERRATA - gsi-openssh: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1298842](show_bug.cgi?id=1298842 "CLOSED ERRATA - gsi-openssh: openssh: possible fallback from untrusted to trusted X11 forwarding [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 19:35:10 UTC  ``` [CVE-2016-1908](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1908) was assigned to this issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/115>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-10 16:51:56 UTC  ``` gsi-openssh-7.1p2-3.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0741)

## Topic

An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2015-5352)
* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users. (CVE-2015-6563)
* A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)
* An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2016-1908)

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Technical Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

# CVE-2015-5352

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-5351.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-5364.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-5352 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5352)

#### Description

The x11\_open\_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9, when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window.

Debian Bug     : 790798 793616 795711 848716 848717

Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the SSH protocol suite:

CVE-2015-5352

    OpenSSH incorrectly verified time window deadlines for X connections.
    Remote attackers could take advantage of this flaw to bypass intended
    access restrictions. Reported by Jann Horn.

CVE-2015-5600

    OpenSSH improperly restricted the processing of keyboard-interactive
    devices within a single connection, which could allow remote attackers
    to perform brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service, in a
    non-default configuration.

CVE-2015-6563

    OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames during PAM authentication. In
    conjunction with an additional flaw in the OpenSSH unprivileged child
    process, remote attackers could make use if this issue to perform user
    impersonation. Discovered by Moritz Jodeit.

CVE-2015-6564

    Moritz Jodeit discovered a use-after-free flaw in PAM support in
    OpenSSH, that could be used by remote attackers to bypass
    authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-1908

    OpenSSH mishandled untrusted X11 forwarding when the X server disables
    the SECURITY extension. Untrusted connections could obtain trusted X11
    forwarding privileges. Reported by Thomas Hoger.

CVE-2016-3115

    OpenSSH improperly handled X11 forwarding data related to
    authentication credentials. Remote authenticated users could make use
    of this flaw to bypass intended shell-command restrictions. Identified
    by github.com/tintinweb.

CVE-2016-6515

    OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication.
    Remote attackers could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service via long strings.

CVE-2016-10009

    Jann Horn discovered an untrusted search path vulnerability in
    ssh-agent allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary local
    PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.

CVE-2016-10011

    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH did not properly consider the
    effects of realloc on buffer contents. This may allow local users to
    obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a
    privilege-separated child process.

CVE-2016-10012

    Guido Vranken discovered that the OpenSSH shared memory manager
    did not ensure that a bounds check was enforced by all compilers,
    which could allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access
    to a sandboxed privilege-separation process.

CVE-2016-10708

    NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash via an out-of-sequence
    NEWKEYS message.

CVE-2017-15906

    Michal Zalewski reported that OpenSSH improperly prevent write
    operations in readonly mode, allowing attackers to create zero-length
    files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:6.7p1-5+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
