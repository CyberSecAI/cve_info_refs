Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-6074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption, which an attacker can exploit to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince a user to visit it via a link in an instant message or email.
- The attacker could also inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites to exploit the vulnerability when a user visits the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website that a user with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer would visit.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious site (e.g., via social engineering or by embedding the exploit on a compromised website).
