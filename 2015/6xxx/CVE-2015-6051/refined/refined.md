Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles permissions related to the `CProtectedModeAPI::ShowSaveFileDialog` API. Specifically, the API can be abused to manipulate the current working directory, leading to DLL planting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation within the `CProtectedModeAPI::ShowSaveFileDialog` API in Internet Explorer.
-  Potential for DLL planting due to manipulation of the current working directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the user, specifically at a medium integrity level.
- This can lead to the attacker gaining the same user rights as the current user.
- If combined with other vulnerabilities, can allow malicious code to run at a medium integrity level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required, such as the user visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create or control a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to lure a user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious file.
- No special privileges are needed to perform the attack, but the target system must run vulnerable versions of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability, meaning it allows the attacker to gain higher privileges than they would normally have.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on November 10th, 2015, and a patch was released by Microsoft.
- The ZDI advisory mentions the vulnerability as a "Protected Mode Sandbox Escape".
