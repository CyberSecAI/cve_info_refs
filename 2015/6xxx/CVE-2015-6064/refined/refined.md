Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2015-6064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to memory corruption in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when the browsers improperly access objects in memory. In the case of Internet Explorer, this occurs due to improper handling of option collections of datalist elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Both browsers suffer from memory corruption vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
*   **Use-After-Free (in IE):** The ZDI advisory specifies that for Internet Explorer, a `COptionElement` object is freed, but then reused, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.
*   **System Compromise:** With administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Webpages:** Attackers can host malicious websites designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be convinced to visit the malicious website or open a malicious file/attachment. This typically involves tricking the user into clicking a link in an email/message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Website/Compromise a Site:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website, or compromise an existing one to deliver the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious site, typically through social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, with the latter also described as having use-after-free condition.
* The Microsoft documents describe the fixes as modifying how the browsers handle objects in memory, also ensuring ASLR is properly implemented in the case of Microsoft Edge.
*  The Zero Day Initiative advisory mentions that the vulnerability in Internet Explorer relates to how it caches option collections of datalist elements.
*  The ZDI advisory also notes that user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* Microsoft rates the impact of this vulnerability as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for servers.

This vulnerability is addressed by security update MS15-112 for Internet Explorer and MS15-113 for Microsoft Edge.
