Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF (CWE-352):** The web interface does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a user into performing unwanted actions on the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions on the web interface with the privileges of a logged-in user. This could lead to unauthorized configuration changes, data modification, or other actions within the scope of the victim user. The impact is classified as "Integrity Impact: Partial" according to the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attacker can be remote, needing only network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **CSRF:** The attack involves tricking a user (who is authenticated to the vulnerable application) into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted web page. This would trigger a request that the application treats as a legitimate request from the authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated, remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance application to conduct the attack.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user who is authenticated to the vulnerable application to click on a malicious link or access a malicious web page.
*   **Victim must be authenticated:** The attack requires an authenticated user to be active (logged in) when the malicious request is triggered.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected products are Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance releases 10.5(1) and 10.6.
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides upgrading to fixed software.
*   Cisco's PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of advisory publication.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.
