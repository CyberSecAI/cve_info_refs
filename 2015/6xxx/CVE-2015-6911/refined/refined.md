Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-6911:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Command Injection in `subtitle.cgi`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** The `subtitle_codepage` parameter within the `subtitle.cgi` script is vulnerable to command injection.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `subtitle_codepage` parameter allows for execution of arbitrary commands.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted GET request to `/webapi/VideoStation/subtitle.cgi` with a malicious payload in the `subtitle_codepage` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability, especially if the 'public share' option is enabled, without authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with `root` privileges, leading to complete compromise of the Synology DiskStation NAS, data exfiltration/manipulation, and the potential for using the NAS as a stepping stone for further attacks.
    *   **Technical Details:** The proof of concept shows the injection of a Python reverse shell payload within the `subtitle_codepage` parameter, allowing the attacker to obtain a shell on the target system.

2.  **SQL Injection in `watchstatus.cgi`**:
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `id` parameter within the `watchstatus.cgi` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the `id` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries.
     *  **Attack Vector:** A POST request to `/webapi/VideoStation/watchstatus.cgi` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests.
     *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements with DBA privileges, potentially compromising the PostgreSQL database server, leading to data breaches or complete database takeover.
    *   **Technical Details:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the usage of SQL syntax (e.g., `15076178770 or 4864=4864--`) to inject malicious code into the SQL query.

3.  **SQL Injection in `audiotrack.cgi`**:
    *   **Root Cause:** The `id` parameter within the `audiotrack.cgi` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Weakness:** The `id` parameter isn't correctly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A POST request to `/webapi/VideoStation/audiotrack.cgi` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the `watchstatus.cgi` vulnerability, this allows arbitrary SQL execution with DBA privileges, leading to compromise of the database server.
    *   **Technical Details:** The proof of concept uses a SQL CASE statement to inject malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Synology Video Station versions up to and including 1.5-0757.

**Fixes:**

*   `audiotrack.cgi` was fixed in Video Station version 1.5-0757.
*   `watchstatus.cgi` and `subtitle.cgi` were fixed in Video Station version 1.5-0763.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `X-SYNO-TOKEN` header provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks but does not prevent direct exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
