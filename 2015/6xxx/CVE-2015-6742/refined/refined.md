Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple design and implementation flaws within the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software, specifically regarding how it handles security-sensitive operations, user authentication, and data protection. These flaws stem from:

1.  **Hardcoded Account for Account Management:**  The software uses a hardcoded account ("ANCO") with a known password for account management tasks across all installations. While the account name and password may have been made unique per installation in later versions, the credentials can be found using another hardcoded account (same username/password for all installations).
2.  **Client-Side Access Control and Auditing:** Critical security functions like login verification, audit logging, and account locking are primarily performed on the client side, making them easily bypassable by manipulating network traffic.
3.  **Insecure Storage of Private Keys:** The private keys used for banking transactions are stored within the SQL database in plaintext or are easily decrypted, making them accessible to users and attackers.
4.  **Plaintext SQL Server Communications:** Communication between the client and the SQL server is done in plaintext without tamper protection, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Hardcoded Credentials:** Using the same credentials across multiple installations creates a single point of failure and allows an attacker with access to one installation to potentially gain access to others.
2.  **Client-Side Security Enforcement:** Relying on the client for crucial security measures allows attackers to bypass these measures by interrupting client processes or manipulating network traffic.
3.  **Insecure Data Storage:** Storing sensitive information like private keys in plaintext exposes them to unauthorized access.
4.  **Lack of Encryption and Authentication:** Unencrypted communication between the client and server allows for eavesdropping and data manipulation.
5.  **Missing Replay Protection:** Allows attackers to reuse captured authentication messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

1.  **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the software using the hardcoded or compromised credentials.
2.  **Financial Fraud:** With access to private keys, attackers can impersonate authorized users and initiate fraudulent banking transactions.
3.  **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify all transaction records, pending transactions, and other data stored in the software, leading to inaccurate financial information and further fraud.
4.  **Bypass of Access Controls:** Attackers can bypass all user permission restrictions, granting them full access to the software's functionality and data.
5.  **Economic Crimes:** Attackers can conduct undetectable economic crimes against user organizations by exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities.
6.  **Duplication of Security Keys:** Attackers can duplicate digital banking security keys used for authenticating transactions.
7.  **Account Lock Bypass**: Attackers can prevent account lockout by terminating the client software process or by directly manipulating the locked accounts table.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Network Traffic Manipulation:** Attackers can intercept and modify the communication between the client and server using a man-in-the-middle attack.
2.  **Direct Access to SQL Database:** Attackers can access the SQL database directly, potentially using another hardcoded account,  to retrieve private keys and other sensitive information.
3.  **Compromised User Account:** Any user can access private keys stored in the database, even if the administrators have restricted access through their policies.
4. **Replay Attacks:** Attackers can reuse captured client-to-server authentication messages to gain access to the banking server.
5.  **Local Access** Attackers that can access a client machine directly can prevent the locking of an account through brute force by simply ending the client process through task manager

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the server for a man-in-the-middle attack or eavesdropping.
2.  **Database Access:** The attacker may need access to the server's database, which may be on the same system as the client.
3.  **Software Access:** An attacker who is a user of the software has access to private keys.
4. **Client Access:** The attacker needs access to a client machine directly in order to prevent account locking locally.
5. **Knowledge of hardcoded credentials:** In order to access the account management functionality, an attacker needs knowledge of hardcoded credentials.
6. **Knowledge of the system:** Attackers need knowledge of how the software works in order to perform some attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were initially reported in August 2012 and demonstrated to Basware and CERT-FI in July 2014, yet remained largely unresolved as of July 2015.
*   The vulnerabilities affect at least 1,500 organizations, primarily in the Nordic and Baltic regions.
*  The vendor had acknowledged some of the issues and claimed to have released fixes, but as of the date of this report, the fixes are incomplete and ineffective.
*  The report includes suggestions for organizations using the software, advising them to take immediate action to mitigate their risks.
*  The report also mentions CVE-2015-0943 related to plain-text SQL server communications.
