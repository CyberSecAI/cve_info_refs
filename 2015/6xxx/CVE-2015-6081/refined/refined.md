Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6081:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of `CTableLayout` objects within Internet Explorer. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force out-of-bounds memory access (reads and writes).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access (read and write) due to improper handling of `CTableLayout` objects.
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and scripting engines.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- Information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly discloses the contents of its memory

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability in Internet Explorer, and convince a user to view it.
- Attackers can use compromised websites, or those that allow user-provided content, by embedding malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.
- An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a legitimate site.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (i.e., the user must visit the malicious page or open a malicious file).
