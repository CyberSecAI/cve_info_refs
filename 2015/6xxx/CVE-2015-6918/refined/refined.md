Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `git.clone` function in the SaltStack's git module was logging HTTP basic authentication credentials (username and password) when cloning a repository over HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive authentication details in the logs. This occurs when a git command with https user/password embedded in the URL fails, leading to the credentials being logged in plain text in the error message

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** An attacker with access to the SaltStack logs could obtain the usernames and passwords used to authenticate with remote git repositories.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected git repositories, potentially leading to further security breaches such as code modification, data theft etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** An attacker would need to gain access to the logs generated by the SaltStack minion or master where the git.clone function has been used and has failed

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Log Access:** The attacker must be able to access the SaltStack logs, either through compromising the machine where the logs are stored or through other means.
- **Knowledge of Git Usage:** The attacker needs to be aware that `git.clone` was used with http auth parameters.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in the SaltStack git module.
- The authentication information was being leaked at the debug log level.
- Salt ships with the log level set to "warning" by default, mitigating the exposure unless the log level was intentionally changed to debug.
- The fix involves redacting the HTTP basic authentication credentials from the logs.
- The issue was addressed in Salt version 2015.5.5.
- A patch was created to sanitize the output by replacing the username and password with `<redacted>`.
