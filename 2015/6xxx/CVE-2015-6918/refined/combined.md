| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1257154#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-26 11:38:29 UTC  ``` It was found that calling git.clone with https user/pass will leak the authentication details to the log.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/28aa9b105804ff433d8f663b2f9b804f2b75495a>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1257154#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-26 11:39:20 UTC  ```  Created salt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1257155](show_bug.cgi?id=1257155 "CLOSED ERRATA - salt: git module leaks authentication details into log [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1257156](show_bug.cgi?id=1257156 "CLOSED ERRATA - salt: git module leaks authentication details into log [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1257154#c2)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-11-18 06:39:10 UTC  ``` Analysis:  Salt git module is affected in Ceph, but git module is not used by ceph  in production environment. Hence Ceph itself is not affected by this vulnerability but shipped salt git module is.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1257154#c4)  Erik Johnson    2016-01-04 22:14:22 UTC  ``` Just to add some more info here, the auth info was only being leaked at the debug loglevel. Salt ships with the loglevel set to "warning" by default, so the issue would not present itself unless the loglevel was intentionally changed to debug.  2015.5.8 builds were submitted today as updates for the Fedora and EPEL branches, which includes fixes to redact HTTPS basic auth credentials.   ``` |  |
