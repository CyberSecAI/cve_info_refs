**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of memory layout information. This is due to the error message returning more data than it should.
  - Memory Leak: The vulnerability is categorized as a memory leak vulnerability in the Adobe Security Bulletin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Information Disclosure: An attacker can glean details about the memory layout of the application.
  - Arbitrary Code Execution: While this specific vulnerability doesn't directly lead to arbitrary code execution, the leaked memory layout information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve that. This implies a chained attack scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
  - User Interaction Required: Exploitation requires some form of user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Remote Access: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
  - Ability to Craft Malicious Content: The attacker needs the ability to either create a malicious page or a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability in the victim's Adobe Reader DC installation.
