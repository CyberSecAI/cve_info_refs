The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the Windows Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol. This race condition results in references to memory locations that have already been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability due to the race condition and improper memory management within the Windows PGM protocol.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges. This would allow them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would first have to log on to the target system. After that, they could run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system and execute a specially crafted application. The system must have MSMQ installed and the PGM protocol enabled. However, MSMQ is not present in default configurations and the PGM protocol is disabled by default even if MSMQ is installed.
