Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Internet Explorer handles CWindow objects. Specifically, a CWindow object is freed, but then subsequently reused.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free vulnerability: After a CWindow object is freed from memory, a dangling pointer is left, which is then reused, leading to memory corruption and potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the affected system.
- The attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: The attacker hosts a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required: The victim must visit the malicious website (or open a malicious file) for the exploit to succeed. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics (e.g., tricking the user into clicking a link via email or instant messenger) or by embedding malicious code in compromised sites or user-provided content platforms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or control content on a website visited by the victim.
- Ability to lure the victim to the malicious page using social engineering techniques or by compromising a website or ad platform.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to how Internet Explorer manages CWindow objects in memory.
- Microsoft has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 11 on Windows client systems. It's rated as critical for clients and moderate for servers.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on August 3, 2015.
