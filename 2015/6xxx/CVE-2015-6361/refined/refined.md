Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the administrative web interface of the Cisco DPC3939 (XB3) router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via the administrative web interface. This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization or validation on the web interface.
- **CWE-20:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-20, which refers to "Improper Input Validation." This reinforces the lack of sanitization as the core issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected router itself and potentially on devices managed by the router.
- **Compromised Devices:** This could lead to a complete compromise of the router and possibly other devices on the network.
- **Partial Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a "Partial" Integrity Impact. The attacker can modify system data, configuration, or behavior. However, complete system compromise does not directly translate to complete loss of integrity, so partial integrity is applicable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote access, specifically via the administrative web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's administrative interface.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the web interface to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the administrative interface of the Cisco DPC3939 (XB3) router.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the router's administrative interface via the network.

**CVSS Metrics:**

- **CVSS v2 Base Score:** 4.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
    - **AV:N (Network):**  Attack vector is via the network.
    - **AC:L (Low):** Attack complexity is low
    - **Au:S (Single):** Single authentication is required.
    - **C:N (None):** No confidentiality impact.
    - **I:P (Partial):** Partial integrity impact.
    - **A:N (None):** No availability impact.
- **CVSS v2 Temporal Score:** 3.2 (E:POC/RL:U/RC:UC)
    - **E:POC (Proof-of-Concept):** A proof of concept exploit is available
    - **RL:U (Unavailable):** No fix is available
     - **RC:UC (Unconfirmed):**  The vulnerability is unconfirmed.
**Additional Notes:**
- The affected product is specifically the Cisco DPC3939 (XB3) router version 121109aCMCST.
- No workarounds were available at the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly announced or known to be exploited in the wild at the time of the advisory.
