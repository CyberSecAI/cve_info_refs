- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the Windows kernel due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would first need to log on to the system, then run a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the system and then execute a specially crafted application.
