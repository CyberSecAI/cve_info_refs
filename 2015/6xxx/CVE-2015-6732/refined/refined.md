Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies within the SemanticForms extension for MediaWiki, specifically in how it handles user-provided input when creating forms and templates.
*   The vulnerability was identified in the "Template label (optional)" field, where user-supplied HTML was not properly sanitized or escaped. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary code.
*   Additionally, the `Special:CreateForm` page was found to be vulnerable due to a missing CSRF token check, enabling an attacker to add malicious templates via CSRF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious code embedded within the "Template label" field was stored and executed when the form was rendered on the Special:FormEdit page.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The lack of CSRF token validation in Special:CreateForm allowed an attacker to manipulate a user's actions and add malicious templates.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Escaping**: The code failed to properly sanitize and escape user input when processing parameters for template labels and other input fields

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to actions like redirecting users to phishing pages, stealing cookies, or performing other unauthorized actions on the victim's behalf.
*   **Unauthorized Template Manipulation**: Attackers could modify or inject malicious content into templates, potentially affecting the functionality and presentation of forms throughout the wiki.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With a crafted form, an attacker could alter or retrieve sensitive information on the target wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Input:** An attacker could directly input malicious scripts into the 'Template label (optional)' field when creating or modifying a form.
*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker could exploit the missing CSRF check in `Special:CreateForm` to trick a user into submitting a crafted form, injecting malicious code into the wiki.
*   **Maliciously crafted URLs:** As described in the initial report for T103391, crafted URLs with specific parameters can trigger reflected XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic knowledge of web attacks:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Access to MediaWiki:** The attacker must have access to a MediaWiki instance with the SemanticForms extension installed.
*   **User Interaction (for CSRF):** To exploit the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs a victim to load a malicious URL or otherwise interact with the attacker's crafted content while being logged into the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported by MediaWiki user Grunny.
*   The fix involves implementing proper HTML escaping, and sanitization of input fields, along with the addition of CSRF checks for affected actions.
*   The CVE was assigned to cover the internal XSS discoveries in `T103761`, but the `T103765` task was also linked to this CVE assignment.
