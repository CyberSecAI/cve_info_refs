  "CVE-2015-6838": {
    "related_to_description": true,
    "root_cause": "The XSLTProcessor class in PHP missed a few checks on the input from the libxslt library. The valuePop() function call able to return with NULL pointer and PHP does not check that, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a segmentation fault, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the XSLTProcessor class to process a specially crafted XML and XSLT file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit XML and XSLT to the target PHP application. No specific privileged access is required."
