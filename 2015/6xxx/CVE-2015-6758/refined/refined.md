Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a "bad-cast" issue within the PDFium library, which is a component of the Chromium browser responsible for PDF rendering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Type confusion or incorrect casting of objects within the PDFium library when processing PDF files. This can lead to unexpected behavior and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is that it could allow an attacker to trigger a crash in the Chromium browser.
- In more severe cases, this bad-cast could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The provided information does not confirm this possibility but it is implied in the security advisory.
- Unspecified bad-cast flaws can lead to various types of memory corruption vulnerabilities if they lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.
- An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a malicious PDF file, which would be loaded and parsed by the PDFium component of the Chromium browser.
- The attack would be triggered by a user opening a malicious PDF in a vulnerable browser, either directly or indirectly by embedding the PDF within a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft or obtain a malicious PDF file containing elements that trigger the bad-cast vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to entice a victim to open the crafted PDF file with a vulnerable version of the Chromium browser. This could be done by hosting the PDF file on a web site or by sending the PDF via other means such as email.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by converting the failing assert into an actual check.
- The provided code review diff reveals that a return `nullptr` was added as a safety precaution to prevent the crash from happening, which was previously handled by an assertion.
- The vulnerability is reported to be rated as "High" severity.
- The fix was included in Chromium version 46.0.2490.71.
- Red Hat and Debian have released security advisories and updates to patch the vulnerability.
