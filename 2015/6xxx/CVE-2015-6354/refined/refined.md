Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the web interface of the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center. Specifically, it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into a page of the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTML Injection: The web interface does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML code.
- CWE-20: This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-20, which relates to Improper Input Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability for an authenticated remote attacker to modify a page of the web interface. This could potentially be used to:
    - Deface the web interface
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Launch further attacks against users of the management interface (e.g., phishing attacks).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the web interface.
- Authentication Required: The attacker must be an authenticated user on the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center, with "Single" authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center's web interface.
- The attacker must be able to send specially crafted requests containing malicious HTML to the web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco FireSight Management Center versions 5.4.1.3 and 6.0.
- **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available. The only solution is to update to the patched software.
- **Exploitability:** Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists
