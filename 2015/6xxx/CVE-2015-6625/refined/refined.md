Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6625:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Wi-Fi component. Specifically, there's an elevation of privilege issue within the Wi-Fi service that could be triggered by a local malicious application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A local application can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code within an elevated system service's context. This means the attacker can gain more privileges than they should have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful attack can give the malicious application elevated capabilities. These capabilities could include access to permissions typically reserved for system applications (Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions), bypassing the intended security model.
- **Access to Wi-Fi Service Data:** An attacker could potentially gain access to Wi-Fi service related information.
- In general, the vulnerability does not allow for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves a malicious application already installed on the device.
- The attacker needs to have installed the malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device. They must be able to execute code on the device to leverage this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The severity is rated as "Moderate" because it allows improper gain of "[dangerous](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html#plevel)" permissions.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Android 6.0.
- The provided AOSP link points to a commit that appears to fix the issue by adding a permission check before accessing certain data within the `WifiScanner` service
