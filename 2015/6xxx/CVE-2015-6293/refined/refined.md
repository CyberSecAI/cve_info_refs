Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the file-range request functionality of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). Specifically, the appliance does not properly handle a high volume of file-range requests, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Resource Management:** The core issue is the appliance's inability to free TCP connections associated with file-range requests, causing a memory leak over time.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak eventually leads to memory exhaustion, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit leads to a denial of service, rendering the WSA appliance unavailable. The appliance becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated remote attacker.
- **File-Range Requests:** The attack vector uses specially crafted or excessive file-range requests to trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WSA appliance.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with file-range specifications.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco AsyncOS versions 8.0 through 8.8 for Cisco WSA (both virtual and hardware).
- **Indicators of Compromise:** An accumulation of TCP connections (viewable via `status detail` command), high number of client connections, and indications of memory exhaustion.
- **Workaround:** Restarting the proxy process using the `diagnostic -> PROXY -> KICK` command can temporarily free up the memory.
- **Fixed Software:** Specific fixed versions of AsyncOS are provided for each affected branch.
- **CVSS Score:** Base Score 7.8, Temporal Score 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C).
- **CWE:** CWE-399 (Resource Management Errors).
