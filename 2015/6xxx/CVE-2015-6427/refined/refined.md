Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6427

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the HTTP attack detection mechanism within decrypted SSL traffic processed by the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center. The system fails to properly detect HTTP-based attacks when the traffic is decrypted SSL and is supposed to use Snort intrusion detection rules for detection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Decrypted SSL Traffic:** The core issue is that the system isn't correctly applying HTTP attack detection rules to decrypted SSL traffic.
- **Bypass of Attack Detection:** This vulnerability allows attackers to circumvent the intended HTTP attack detection.
- **CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues):** This is flagged in the content, but the specific link to cryptography within this vulnerability isn't clarified in the provided details. It may be related to the way the system is decrypting SSL or handling decrypted traffic in relation to attack detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to bypass the intended intrusion detection system, potentially leading to further exploitation.
- **Unidentified Attacks:** The system will fail to identify and potentially prevent HTTP based attacks, which could lead to malicious code injection or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based Attacks:** An attacker can target the vulnerable system remotely via the network.
- **Decrypted SSL Traffic:** The attacker must use encrypted SSL traffic that is then decrypted by the FireSIGHT Management Center, where the vulnerability exists during the application of HTTP attack detection rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target system to send the malicious traffic.
- **Knowledge of System Weakness:** The attacker must craft attacks that leverage this specific vulnerability, by sending HTTP based attack within encrypted SSL traffic.
- **Ability to Send HTTP traffic within SSL:** The attacker must be able to send the specific malicious traffic within SSL/TLS encrypted packets to be decrypted by the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- **No Workarounds:** The advisory explicitly states that no workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Fixed Software:** The advisory directs users to the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive for software upgrades that fix the issue.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 and a temporal score of 4.8. The vector string is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C.
- **No known public exploits:** According to the advisory, there are no known public exploits or malicious use of this vulnerability.
