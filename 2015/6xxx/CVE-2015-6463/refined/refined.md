- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the handling of the HART longtag response field within Endress+Hauser's Fieldcare and CodeWrights HART Comm DTM software libraries. Specifically, the longtag field is capable of storing an XML schema. When the HART Comm DTM reads the XML schema from the longtag, it attempts to retrieve XML schema or the document from the location stored in the longtag without proper validation, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - XML Injection (CWE-91) - The software is vulnerable to XML injection attacks because it parses an XML schema received from a longtag field without sanitization.
    - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - The software attempts to retrieve XML schema or document from a location specified in the XML schema, which can be manipulated by an attacker, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.
    - XML External Entity (XXE) attacks - The parsing of external entities within the provided XML schema can lead to XXE vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Disclosure of confidential data
    - Denial of service
    - Port scanning
    - System impacts (from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located)
    - Bypassing network controls by exploiting SSRF
    - Exposure of internal resources
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network receiving HART DTM packets. The attacker can inject malicious XML into the longtag of a HART packet response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network capable of receiving HART DTM packets. They require the ability to manipulate the HART packet response, specifically the longtag field, with a crafted XML payload. Low skill is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
