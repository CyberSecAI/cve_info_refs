The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-6046.

**CVE-2015-6046**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** This is a memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper memory access leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view the site via a link or email attachment. Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content could also be used to host the exploit.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a webpage and convince a user to view the page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

The document provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the specific cause of the memory corruption, the various attack vectors, and the potential impact in more detail, including the ability to gain full system control if the user is an administrator. It also discusses the mitigation offered by Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers and the potential use of EMET for further mitigation.
