**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the way Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles specific fields within a PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A dangling pointer is reused after the memory it points to has been freed. This is caused by a specially crafted PDF file with a specific combination of fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable Adobe Reader.
- The attacker gains control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file containing specific fields that trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The target user must open the malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability. This can be through visiting a malicious page or by opening a malicious file directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted malicious PDF file.
- The attacker must convince the target user to open the malicious PDF. This could involve social engineering tactics.
