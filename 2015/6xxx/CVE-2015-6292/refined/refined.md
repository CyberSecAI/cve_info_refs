Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the proxy cache functionality of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). Specifically, the system does not properly manage TCP connections which can lead to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper resource management in the proxy cache functionality.
- Memory leak due to unreleased TCP connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition: An attacker can exhaust the system's memory, leading to the device becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Unauthenticated attacker: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco WSA.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an accumulation of TCP connections that are not properly released.
- The "status detail" command in the Cisco WSA CLI can be used to check for a large number of client connections, indicating a potential compromise.
- A temporary workaround is provided (using the hidden "diagnostic -> PROXY -> KICK" command) to restart the proxy process and free memory.
- Cisco has released fixed software versions for affected releases to resolve the vulnerability.
