Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the certificate generation process within the admin web interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). Specifically, it involves a command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The web interface fails to properly sanitize or validate user input during the certificate generation process. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute commands on the affected system with *root*-level privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker could gain complete control over the affected Cisco WSA, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or further lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is conducted through the WSA's administrative web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WSA's administrative interface. This suggests that the attacker could be an insider or have compromised valid administrator credentials.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco WSA.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.0 and a temporal score of 8.5, indicating a critical severity.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco AsyncOS for the WSA versions 8.0 and later (both virtual and hardware versions) are affected.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available; upgrading the software is necessary to remediate the vulnerability.
*   **Exploitation Status:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco was not aware of any public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
