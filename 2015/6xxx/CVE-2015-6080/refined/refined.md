The content is related to CVE-2015-6080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the improper way Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, enabling them to install software, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious website. This could be through a link in an email or instant message.
- Exploitation can occur through compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content/advertisements that contain the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a website.
- The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit the malicious website through social engineering tactics (e.g., clicking on a link).
