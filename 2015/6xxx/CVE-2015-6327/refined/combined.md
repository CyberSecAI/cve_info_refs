| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco ASA Software VPN ISAKMP Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20151021-asa-ike  First Published: 2015 October 21 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2015 November 12 14:15 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCus94026](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus94026)     CVE-2015-6327     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2015-6327     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 1 (v1) code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected   system to reload.  Affected Products  * Cisco ASA Software running on the following products is affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)See the "Fixed Software" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.   Vulnerable ProductsCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate IKEv1 VPN connections.       This includes the following:   + LAN-to-LAN using IKEv1   + Remote Access VPN using the IPSec VPN client   + Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)-over-IPSec VPN connectionsCisco ASA Software is not affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate the following VPN connections:   + Clientless SSL   + AnyConnect SSL   + IKEv2 AnyConnect   + IKEv2 LAN-to-LANTo determine whether the Cisco ASA is configured to terminate IKEv1 VPN connections, a crypto map should be configured for at least one interface. Administrators should use the **show running-config crypto map | include interface** command and verify that it returns output. The following example shows a crypto map called *cmap* configured on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface   crypto map outside_map interface outside      ``` Additionally IKEv1 should also be enabled on that interface. This can be determined by using the s**how running-config crypto ikev1** command, or **show running-config | include crypto isakmp enable** command for Cisco ASA Software releases prior to 8.4, and verifying that ikev1 is enabled on the interface.       The following example shows IKEv1 enabled on the outside interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev1    crypto ikev1 enable outside      ``` **Note:** IKEv1 is not configured by default.      Determining the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can use the **show version** command. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ```    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software   version in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left   corner of the Cisco ASDM window.   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco FirePOWER 9300 ASA Security Module is not affected by this vulnerability         No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Indicators of Compromise  * A Cisco ASA device reloading with thread name *IKE Daemon* may indicate exploitation of this vulnerability.      The thread name is listed at the beginning of the *crashinfo* file. The *crashinfo* file can be accessed by using the **show crashinfo** command. The following example shows a *crashinfo* file with thread name *IKE Daemon*: ```   ciscoasa# show crashinfo    : Saved_Crash   Thread Name: IKE Daemon...    ``` Customers   should contact their support organization if they suspect active   exploitation of this vulnerability to have the traceback   decoded to confirm whether the crash is due to this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
