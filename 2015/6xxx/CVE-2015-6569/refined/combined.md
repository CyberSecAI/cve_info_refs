The deference violations (may incur by data races) need to be fixed in LoadBalancer module. Those bugs can cause a serious vulnerability, .i.e., blocking forwarding module.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Release Notes

*Release Date: February 7, 2016*

### Overview

The v1.2 Floodlight release builds upon the improvements made in v1.1, with emphasis on more robust and feature-rich core modules, including completely rewritten Device, Topology, and Forwarding modules. A new Statistics module provides port bandwidth statistics and also serves a multithreading and statistics collection example. IPv6, Link latency, OF-DPA, message listener, and many more exciting features are discussed below. Many thanks to [everyone](/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/1343535/Authors%2Band%2BContributors) who has contributed to and supported Floodlight!
