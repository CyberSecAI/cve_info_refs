- Root cause of vulnerability: The LDAPLoginModule implementation in ActiveMQ allows successful authentication with an empty password if the configured LDAP server supports unauthenticated authentication. Additionally, it allows wildcard characters in the username, enabling brute-force password attacks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Empty password authentication bypass.
    - Wildcard interpretation in username fields, leading to brute-force password attacks.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism of an application using LDAPLoginModule, assuming the role of any valid user. With a valid password, the attacker can successfully authenticate and publish/subscribe to a queue.
- Attack vectors: Remote exploitation via the LDAP authentication mechanism.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the application using the vulnerable LDAPLoginModule and knowledge of a valid user on the LDAP server.
