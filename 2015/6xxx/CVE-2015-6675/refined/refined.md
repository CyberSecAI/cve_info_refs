- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RUGGEDCOM ROS operating system for layer 2 switches includes IP forwarding capabilities that cannot be deactivated by users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unintended proxy or intermediary (CWE-441) leading to the circumvention of VLAN isolation. Specifically, the presence of IP forwarding capabilities that are not user-deactivatable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in one VLAN could circumvent VLAN isolation and communicate with devices in another VLAN if IP addresses are configured on both VLANs. This could allow an attacker to reach systems they should not be able to access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, in a VLAN that is configured on the device, and have a medium skill level to exploit the vulnerability.
