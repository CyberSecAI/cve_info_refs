- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the Windows font library improperly handling specially crafted embedded fonts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist within the Windows graphics component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution. This allows the attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded fonts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious document or host a malicious webpage, and convince a user to interact with it.
