Subject: Re: CVE Request: ATutor LMS Version 2.2 with stored XSS and file upload issue

Use CVE-2015-6521 for all of these XSS issues. We think they don't
overlap CVE-2010-0971.

We don't think this is a type of issue for which a CVE ID is typically
assigned. See also the second-to-last part of the
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/06/6> post.

For web applications, file upload is often of interest because the
attacker can upload a file with an extension recognized by a web
server as an executable file, e.g., an extension listed on an
AddHandler line in an Apache HTTP Server configuration. We're not sure
whether there are any web servers that, in their default
configuration, have an AddHandler equivalent for all extensionless
files. Although a web application might want to block uploads of any
file that has a native executable-file format recognized by the
underlying operating system, we don't think this is a commonly
recommended feature, and we don't believe we should be assigning CVE
IDs to every web application that omits this feature. (We're not
disputing that the feature could sometimes be useful. Most web
applications aren't intended to receive native executables through an
upload mechanism, and there might be attack methodologies that rely on
these uploads, e.g., uploading something like Staog --
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staog> -- to a Linux machine with a
filename of Staog and no extension.)

If there is something about a web application that makes native
executables especially dangerous (e.g., local users are somehow
encouraged to open all non-PHP files uploaded by web visitors) or if a
vendor was actually trying to block all native executables but the
code was wrong, then a CVE ID could exist.

## Description

[![@spchal](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1622479?v=4&size=48)](/spchal)[spchal](https://github.com/spchal)opened [on Aug 11, 2015](https://github.com/atutor/ATutor/issues/103#issue-100348266)

Persistent cross site scripting and file upload attacks possible in course management

Course management is lacking input validation in many places that allows stored XSS attacks and malicious file upload.

Following are the vulnerable regions:

1. Create course:

   The course name is not validated that allows to inject a javascript query into the name field.

   Steps to reproduce:

* Instructor A creates a course with a script in course name as follows: `<script>alert('CourseAlert');</script>`
* Another script in banner. `<script>alert('BannerAlert');</script>`
* Login as admin.
* When you click on courses, the ‘CourseAlert’ pops up.
* Every time the course profile is checked by the student, the ‘BannerAlert’ also pops up.

  Severity is high as admin could be attacked with a malicious script.

2. File Upload in course

   There are illegal file extensions mentioned where all the executable files are checked. But a file without any extension is accepted. This could be a binary executable file.

   Filename - It is possible to mount a javascript into this variable. Filename is not validated.

   File content - An attacker can write a malicious script into the file content and upload.

Steps to reproduce:

* Instructor A goes to his course and then go to file storage.
* Clicks on create a new file.
* The file name is given as : `<script>alert('File1');</script>`
* The file content is given as `<script>alert('Filecontent');</script>`
* Now a student/Admin logs in. As soon as a page displaying file name comes, the script `File1` gets popped up even without clicking on it.
* If the content is downloaded, the alert `Filecontent` pops up.

This is of very high severity as this allows an instructor to post a virus as a file upload. Every student gets attacked. Even the administrator while accessing the course get attacked if the attack is mounted.

Solution:

Against XSS: Input validation using `htmlspecialchars()`

Against file upload: Use a white list of extensions that are allowed to be uploaded rather than extensions that are not allowed (black list).
