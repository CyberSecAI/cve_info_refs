Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation in ATutor LMS, which allows for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data in course names, banners, and file names, and allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored and executed when these fields are displayed. Additionally, the file upload functionality lacks proper validation for file extensions, allowing the upload of files without any extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Stored XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in several areas related to courses, such as:
    *   Course names
    *   Course banners
    *   File names
    This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed whenever the affected content is displayed.
2. **Insecure File Upload:** The application uses a blacklist approach to validate uploaded file extensions, instead of a whitelist. Furthermore, it allows files without any extension to be uploaded. This allows an attacker to upload potentially dangerous executable files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that could:
    *   Steal user session cookies.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of users.
    *   Modify or deface content visible to other users.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges by attacking administrators.
2.  **Insecure File Upload:** An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., an executable, or a file containing a malicious script), leading to:
    *   Compromise of the user's system if the file is executed.
    *   Further compromise of the server if the file can be executed from the server.
    *   Spread of malware to other users who download the malicious file.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **XSS:** An authenticated user with instructor privileges injects the malicious code through the following fields:
    * Course Name
    * Course Banner
    * File Name
2. **Insecure File Upload:** An authenticated user with instructor privileges uploads a malicious file through the file storage feature of a course.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the following:
*   An account with instructor privileges within the ATutor LMS application.
*   The ability to create or edit course materials, including file uploads.
