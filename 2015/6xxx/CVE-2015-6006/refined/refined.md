{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an integer truncation error in the AddUserFinding function. A user-controlled string's length is used to calculate a memory offset. If the string length exceeds 0x7fff, it is truncated to a negative value, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and write to out of bounds memory. This could allow the attacker to gain control of program execution, overwrite data, cause a denial of service, or potentially leak information.",
    "attack_vectors": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 containing a string with a length greater than 0x7fff.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service, no authentication is needed"
