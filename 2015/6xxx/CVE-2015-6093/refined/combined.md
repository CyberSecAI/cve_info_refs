## Security Update for Microsoft Office to Address Remote Code Execution (3104540)

Published: November 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Correcting how Office handles objects in memory
* Ensuring that Internet Explorer prevents affected Office applications from being instantiated via a COM control
* Correcting how Microsoft Outlook validates and sanitizes HTML input

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3104540](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3104540).

[1]Before installing this update, you must have update 2965218 and security update 3039779 installed. See the **Update FAQ** for more information.

## Update FAQ

**I have Microsoft Word 2010 installed. Why am I not being offered the 3101529 update?**

The 3101529 update only applies to systems running specific configurations of Microsoft Office 2010. Some configurations will not be offered the update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2013 products, only Microsoft Office 2013 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Excel 2013, Microsoft Visio 2013, or any other Microsoft Office 2013 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

**Why are some of the update files listed in this bulletin also denoted in MS15-123 - Security Update for Skype for Business and Lync to Address Information Disclosure?**
Several of the update files listed in this bulletin (MS15-116) are also denoted in MS15-123 because of overlaps in affected software. Although the two bulletins address separate security vulnerabilities, the security updates have been consolidated where possible and appropriate. For this reason, some identical update files are present in both of these bulletins.

Note that identical update files shipping with multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

**Are there any prerequisites for any of the updates offered in this bulletin for affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business)?**

Yes. Customers running affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) must first install the 2965218 update for Office 2013 released in April, 2015, and then the 3039779 security update released in May, 2015. For more information about these two prerequisite updates, see:

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

## Microsoft Office Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2503

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when an attacker instantiates an affected Office application via a COM control. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and break out of the Internet Explorer sandbox.

To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to take advantage of an existing vulnerability in Internet Explorer by tricking a user into downloading a specially crafted application.

Most likely, this vulnerability would be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit this vulnerability to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that Internet Explorer prevents affected Office applications from being instantiated via a COM control.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-2503](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2503). At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Outlook for Mac Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6123

A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft Outlook for Mac does not sanitize HTML or treat it in a safe manner. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting them to a malicious website. The malicious website could spoof content or be used as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.

For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must preview a maliciously crafted email from an attacker where they would unknowingly be redirected to a malicious URL.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Outlook validates and sanitizes HTML input. Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
