Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Microsoft Office software when handling objects in memory improperly. Specifically, within the processing of name tables in an embedded TTF (TrueType Font) file, incorrect processing of a size value can cause Word to copy too much data and corrupt memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to incorrect size calculation/handling when processing TTF files.
- The vulnerability is triggered by malformed or crafted TTF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the affected system, allowing for installation of programs, data manipulation, or creation of new accounts.
- Users with fewer privileges have a reduced impact from successful exploitation

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email attack: Sending a specially crafted file to a user and convincing them to open it.
- Web-based attack: Hosting a website or leveraging a compromised website containing a specially crafted file that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker must convince users to visit the site and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a specially crafted file that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file. This can be achieved through social engineering.
- For web-based attacks, the attacker needs to host or compromise a website and convince users to visit the site and open the file.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability specifically affects the processing of name tables in an embedded TTF file within Microsoft Word.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability is associated with the ZDI advisory ZDI-15-539.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['20732'].

The document provides more specific details than the official CVE description such as the exact location of the vulnerability being in the handling of TTF files as well as the specific attack vectors.
