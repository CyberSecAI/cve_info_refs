Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6464:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from ics-cert.us-cert.gov explicitly mentions CVE-2015-6464 and describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in Moxa industrial managed switches, which aligns with the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly restrict access in the administrative web interface of Moxa Ethernet switches. User-level accounts, which should have read-only access, can bypass security checks, granting them unauthorized administrative privileges.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** User-level accounts can circumvent access controls to gain elevated administrative privileges.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can compromise the **availability**, **integrity**, and **confidentiality** of the affected Moxa switches, as well as connected industrial assets. This means they could:
      - Disrupt switch operations (availability)
      - Modify switch configurations (integrity)
      - Access sensitive data (confidentiality)

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability is exploited through the administrative web interface of the Moxa switch.
   - The attack is done remotely.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to have:
       - Network access to the Moxa switch
       - Access to a user-level account on the device.
   - The attacker needs to be authenticated

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Moxa EDS-405A/EDS-408A series managed Ethernet switches with firmware Version V3.4 build 14031419 and prior.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with low skill.
