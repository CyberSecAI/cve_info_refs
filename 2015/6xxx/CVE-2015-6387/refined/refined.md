Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6387

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the HTTP web-based management interface of the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Central Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web interface.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote attack over the network through the vulnerable HTTP web-based management interface.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the web interface of the affected Cisco UCS Central software.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to send these requests to the targeted system over the network.
*   The attacker does not need credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Central Software version 1.3(0.1).
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Security Researcher Gregory Draperi.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.0 (Base) and 4.8 (Temporal), with the vector string: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C.
*   The exploitability is functional, meaning an exploit code is available.
