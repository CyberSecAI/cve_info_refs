# Moxa OnCell Central Manager Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-328-01

## OVERVIEW

NCCIC/ICS-CERT received a report from HP’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) concerning hardcoded credentials and authentication bypass vulnerabilities in Moxa’s OnCell Central Manager Software. These vulnerabilities were reported to ZDI by security researcher Andrea Micalizzi. Moxa has released a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Moxa OnCell Central Manager Software versions are affected:

* OnCell Central Manager Software prior to version 2.2.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanisms and perform remote code execution.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Moxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.

The affected product, OnCell Central Manager, is a central management software that allows configuration, management, and monitoring of remote devices. According to Moxa, OnCell Central Manager is deployed across several sectors, including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems, and others. Moxa estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Moxa has released OnCell Central Manager, Version 2.2, to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Moxa recommends upgrading to Version 2.2, which can be downloaded at the following URL:

<http://www.moxa.com/support/sarch_result.aspx?type=soft&prod_id=3116&type_id=6>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Use application whitelisting, which will not prevent memory-based attacks such as exploiting buffer overflows vulnerabilities, but it can prevent shellcode from running executables that have not been authorized, thereby limiting the impact of memory-based attacks that call files.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-6480](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6480) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Moxa](http://www.moxa.com/support) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [OnCell Central Manager](http://www.moxa.com/Product/OnCell_Central_Manager.htm) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19418']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Moxa OnCell Central Manager Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the MessageBrokerServlet servlet, which does not ensure a user is authenticated prior to accepting commands. An attacker can exploit this condition to perform various actions, including addUserAndGroup, to take full control of the product and achieve code execution on all managed hosts. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.  02/05/2015 - ZDI sent reports to ICS-CERT02/09/2015 - ZDI receieved an ACK and ticket # from ICS-CERT04/14/2015 - ZDI recieved an update from ICS-CERT that these cases were in work, but "months out"04/15/2015 - ZDI reminded ISC-CERT of the prediacted disclosure date, but indicated some flexibility if the vendor could come close05/14/2015 - ICS-CERT advised ZDI that the vendor could not patch until August05/14/2015 - ZDI agreed to go out to August 509/14/2015 - After getting a response that other Moxa cases had patched, but seemingly not these, ZDI asked ICS-CERT if these did not patch with the August 27 patch09/15/2015 - ICS-CERT indicated that they would reach out to the vendor for clarification and requested extension to do so. ZDI declined an extension, but indicated we "will wait a couple of days, for a status."09/18/2015 - ZDI notified ICS-CERT of the intent to 0-day the reports  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.  -- Vendor Patch:See <https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-328-01> |
