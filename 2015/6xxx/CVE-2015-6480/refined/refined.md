Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Moxa OnCell Central Manager Software contains a vulnerable servlet (`MessageBrokerServlet`) that does not properly enforce authentication. Specifically, the servlet does not ensure a user is authenticated before accepting commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism due to the vulnerable servlet. This allows unauthenticated users to send commands to the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server hosting the Moxa OnCell Central Manager Software.
*   **Full Control:** An attacker can potentially gain full control of the product, including the ability to add users and groups and take control over managed hosts. This could allow attackers to manipulate or control devices managed by the software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, over a network.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the vulnerable server in order to send malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is described as achievable by an attacker with low skill.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable server through the network. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) and reported through HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   ZDI publicly disclosed the vulnerability due to the lack of timely vendor response.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2015-6480 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Moxa OnCell Central Manager Software that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a flaw in the `MessageBrokerServlet`.
