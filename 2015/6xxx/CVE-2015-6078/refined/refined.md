Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's browser engine (both Internet Explorer and Edge). The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the browsers improperly access objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this memory corruption allows for remote code execution.
- **ASLR Bypass:** This vulnerability is linked to an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass (CVE-2015-6088), which makes the exploitation more reliable

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the same privileges as the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Webpage:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage designed to trigger the memory corruption.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious code into compromised or user-content hosting websites.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website by clicking a link, or opening a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Hosting:** Ability to host or inject malicious code into a website.
- **Social Engineering:** Ability to convince users to interact with the malicious content (e.g., through a link or attachment).
- **Knowledge of Memory Corruption Exploitation:** Technical knowledge to develop an exploit that leverages the memory corruption.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Internet Explorer (7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) and Microsoft Edge.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems
- The provided documents also list other CVEs that are addressed in the same security updates (MS15-112 and MS15-113), several of which also relate to memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Edge.
- The update modifies how Internet Explorer and Edge handle objects in memory and helps to ensure the proper implementation of ASLR.
- The vulnerability is not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited.
- The documents mention that EMET can help mitigate these vulnerabilities if configured to work with the affected browsers.
