Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6636:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `mediaserver` component, specifically during the processing of media files and data. A specially crafted file can trigger memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of media files within the mediaserver process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution within the context of the `mediaserver` service.
- The mediaserver service has access to audio and video streams and other privileges not typically accessible to third-party apps. This could allow an attacker to gain control over the affected device's media functionalities and potentially more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through multiple methods including:
  - Email
  - Web browsing
  - MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)
- These methods involve the processing of malicious media files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the target device through email, web browsing, or MMS.
- No specific user interaction is mentioned beyond normal processing of received content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution within the mediaserver service.
- Patches for this vulnerability are available in Android builds 5.0, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
- The vulnerability was reported internally by Google.
- The fix involves adding new memset operations to avoid uninitialized reads for error clips, and aligning a few allocations to a 4 byte boundary.
- The commit message states "DO NOT MERGE Added few memset to avoid uninitialized reads for error clips Also aligned few allocations to 4 byte boundary."

**Summary of technical details:**
The vulnerability stems from memory corruption within the mediaserver process when handling specific media file formats. Exploitation leads to remote code execution with high privileges because the mediaserver service interacts directly with media streams, thereby granting access to sensitive functionalities. This vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending specially crafted files over email, browser, or MMS, highlighting its wide-ranging attack surface. The fix specifically addresses uninitialized read operations and memory alignment, crucial for avoiding memory corruption scenarios.
