Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the TACACS protocol implementation within the Cisco ASR 5000 and ASR 5500 System Software. Specifically, improper handling of TACACS requests leads to a crash of the *vpnmgr* process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation or error handling within the TACACS implementation, specifically related to the processing of TACACS requests. This allows a malicious actor to cause an unhandled exception that results in the crash of the vulnerable process.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause the *vpnmgr* process to restart.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Partial Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the *vpnmgr* process restarting. This causes a partial denial-of-service condition, disrupting the normal operation of the device. The service disruption may impact functionality dependent on *vpnmgr*.
- Core File Generation: The affected system will generate a core dump file for the crashed *vpnmgr* process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is network-based, targeting the device's TACACS interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, Unauthenticated Access: An attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability and can trigger it remotely over the network.
- Knowledge of TACACS Protocol: An attacker would need some knowledge about the TACACS protocol to formulate a request that will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The Cisco advisory explicitly mentions that no workarounds are available.
- The advisory provides specific Cisco bug IDs (CSCuw01984 and CSCuw01985) associated with the vulnerability.
- The advisory provides a sample output from the `show crash` command that can be used to verify the vulnerability after exploitation.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
- Temporal Score: 4.1 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
- Environmental Score: 4.1.

The base score reflects the vulnerability's impact (partial availability impact) and the ease of attack (network access, low complexity, and no authentication). The temporal score considers that functional exploit code is available, an official fix has been made available, and the vulnerability is confirmed.
