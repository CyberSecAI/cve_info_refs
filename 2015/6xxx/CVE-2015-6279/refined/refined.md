Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets that use the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The system does not properly validate IPv6 ND packets with the CGA option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause an affected Cisco device to reload, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who does not need to authenticate.
- Malformed IPv6 ND packets: The attacker sends malformed IPv6 ND packets containing the CGA option to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network connectivity to send packets to the targeted device.
- No authentication: The attacker does not require any authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- Send crafted packets: The attacker needs to be able to craft specific malicious IPv6 ND packets.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS and IOS XE software where the IPv6 snooping feature is enabled.
- The IPv6 snooping feature is part of the first-hop security features.
- The provided documents include mitigation, which is to disable the IPv6 snooping feature until an upgrade is available, and a list of affected and fixed software releases.
