Affected Products  * These   vulnerabilities affect products running Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE   Software. See the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this   security advisory for more information about the affected versions of the software.   Vulnerable ProductsDevices running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by both vulnerabilities if the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features is configured.   To determine whether the IPv6 snooping feature is configured, use the **show running config | include ipv6 snooping|interface** command and verify that ipv6 snooping is configured on an interface, or use the **show ipv6 snooping policies** command.      The following examples shows the output of these commands on a router with IPV6 snooping configured on the GigabitEthernet0/0/1 interface:    ```   router#show running-config | include ipv6 snooping|interface...interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1ipv6 snooping...   router#show ipv6 snooping policiesTarget               Type  Policy               Feature        Target rangeGi0/0/1              PORT  default              Snooping       vlan all   ```  To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to **Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software** or **Cisco IOS Software**. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   !--- output truncated   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR is not affected by these vulnerabilities.   Cisco NX-OS is not affected by these vulnerabilities.   Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) is not affected by these vulnerabilities.         No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * To provide security and scalability, the IPv6 snooping feature bundles several Layer 2 IPv6 first-hop   security features, including IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) inspection, IPv6   device tracking, IPv6 address glean, and IPv6 binding table recovery. IPv6 ND inspection operates either at Layer   2, or between Layer 2 and Layer 3 to provide IPv6 features with   security and scalability.      Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software that is configured to use the IPv6 snooping feature is affected by the following two vulnerabilities:      **Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Denial of Service Vulnerability**A vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IPv6 ND packets that use the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet to an affected device where the IPv6 Snooping feature is enabled.      This   vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuo04400](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo04400) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and   Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6279.      **Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Secure Network Discovery Denial of Service Vulnerability**A vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr) against specific IPv6 ND packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of traffic consisting of specific IPv6 ND packets to an affected device where the IPv6 snooping feature is configured.      This   vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCus19794](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus19794) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and   Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6278  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.       Administrators may disable the IPv6 snooping feature on an affected device until the device is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.       To disable IPv6 snooping use the **no ipv6 snooping** command in the interface configuration mode for each interface where the feature has been configured.      To verify that the feature was disabled, use the **show running-config | include ipv6 snooping** command or the **show ipv6 snooping policies** command.      The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with IPv6 snooping disabled:  ```   router#show ipv6 snooping policiesTarget               Type  Policy               Feature        Target rangerouter#   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.          Cisco IOS Software Cisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication The tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.  (Example entry: 15.1(4)M2)                    For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), and [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252).      **Cisco IOS XE Software**      Cisco IOS XE Software is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.         | Cisco  IOS XE  Software  Train | First Fixed Release for  this Advisory | First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2015 Cisco IOS and IOS XE  Software Security Advisory  Bundled Publication |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 2.6 | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.1S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.1SG | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.2S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.2SE | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. |   | 3.2SG | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.2SQ | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.2XO | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.3S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.3SE | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. |   | 3.3SG | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.3SQ | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.3XO | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. |   | 3.4S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.4SG | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. |   | 3.4SQ | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.5E | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later. |   | 3.5S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.5SQ | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |   | 3.6E | 3.6.3E | 3.6.3E |   | 3.6S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.7E | 3.7.2E | 3.7.2E |   | 3.7S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.8S | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.9S | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later. |   | 3.10S | 3.10.6S | 3.10.6S |   | 3.11S | 3.11.4S | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.3S or later. |   | 3.12S | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.3S or later. | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.3S or later. |   | 3.13S | 3.13.3S | 3.13.3S |   | 3.14S | 3.14.2S | Vulnerable; migrate to 3.15.1S or later. |   | 3.15S | Not vulnerable | 3.15.1S |   | 3.16S | Not vulnerable | Not vulnerable |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Two vulnerabilities in the IPv6 first hop security feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150923-fhs ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150923-fhs"]
Note: The September 23, 2015, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes three Cisco Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: September 2015 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep15.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep15.html"]
These vulnerabilities affect products running Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software. See the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions of the software.
Devices running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by both vulnerabilities if the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features is configured.
To determine whether the IPv6 snooping feature is configured, use the show running config | include ipv6 snooping|interface command and verify that ipv6 snooping is configured on an interface, or use the show ipv6 snooping policies command.
The following examples shows the output of these commands on a router with IPV6 snooping configured on the GigabitEthernet0/0/1 interface:
router#show running-config | include ipv6 snooping|interface
...
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
ipv6 snooping
...
router#show ipv6 snooping policies
Target Type Policy Feature Target range
Gi0/0/1 PORT default Snooping vlan all
To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].
Cisco IOS XR is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
Cisco NX-OS is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
To provide security and scalability, the IPv6 snooping feature bundles several Layer 2 IPv6 first-hop security features, including IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) inspection, IPv6 device tracking, IPv6 address glean, and IPv6 binding table recovery. IPv6 ND inspection operates either at Layer 2, or between Layer 2 and Layer 3 to provide IPv6 features with security and scalability.
Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software that is configured to use the IPv6 snooping feature is affected by the following two vulnerabilities:
Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Denial of Service Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IPv6 ND packets that use the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet to an affected device where the IPv6 Snooping feature is enabled.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuo04400 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo04400"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6279.
Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Secure Network Discovery Denial of Service Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr) against specific IPv6 ND packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of traffic consisting of specific IPv6 ND packets to an affected device where the IPv6 snooping feature is configured.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus19794 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus19794"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6278
There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.
Administrators may disable the IPv6 snooping feature on an affected device until the device is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.
To disable IPv6 snooping use the no ipv6 snooping command in the interface configuration mode for each interface where the feature has been configured.
To verify that the feature was disabled, use the show running-config | include ipv6 snooping command or the show ipv6 snooping policies command.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with IPv6 snooping disabled:
router#show ipv6 snooping policies
Target Type Policy Feature Target range
router#
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
Cisco IOS Software
Cisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The Cisco IOS Software Checker ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"] allows customers to perform the following tasks:
Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system
Enter show version command output for the tool to parse
Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication
The tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the Cisco IOS Software Checker ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"] or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.
(Example entry: 15.1(4)M2)
For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21\_gen.html#wp3000032"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_rel\_notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_sys\_req.html#wp3069754"], and Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_24726.html#pgfId-2570252"].

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.
Administrators may disable the IPv6 snooping feature on an affected device until the device is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.
To disable IPv6 snooping use the no ipv6 snooping command in the interface configuration mode for each interface where the feature has been configured.
To verify that the feature was disabled, use the show running-config | include ipv6 snooping command or the show ipv6 snooping policies command.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device with IPv6 snooping disabled:
router#show ipv6 snooping policies
Target Type Policy Feature Target range

If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "To provide security and scalability, the IPv6 snooping feature bundles several Layer 2 IPv6 first-hop security features, including IPv6 neighbor discovery (ND) inspection, IPv6 device tracking, IPv6 address glean, and IPv6 binding table recovery. IPv6 ND inspection operates either at Layer 2, or between Layer 2 and Layer 3 to provide IPv6 features with security and scalability.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software that is configured to use the IPv6 snooping feature is affected by the following two vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IPv6 ND packets that use the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet to an affected device where the IPv6 Snooping feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuo04400 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo04400\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6279.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Secure Network Discovery Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr) against specific IPv6 ND packets.
