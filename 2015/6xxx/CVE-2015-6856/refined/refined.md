{
  "CVE-2015-6856": {
    "root_cause": "The Dell Pre-Boot Authentication Driver (PBADRV.sys) does not validate the 'OutputAddress' from the IOCTL call before writing to memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uncontrolled write to arbitrary memory address"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the HalDispatchTable entry to point to a user-land address, then executing shellcode.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "IOCTL (DeviceIoControlFile)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make IOCTL calls to the vulnerable driver. They need to know the device name (`\\\\.\\PBADRV`) and the IOCTL code to exploit the vulnerability."
