```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A vulnerability in the ndvbs module allows an attacker to inject memory they control into an arbitrary memory location.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Write-what-where condition (CWE-123).
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution, elevation of privilege by overwriting function pointers in HalDispatchTable.
- Attack vectors:  IOCTL (DeviceIoControl)
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable device driver `ndvbs.sys` through IOCTL calls.
