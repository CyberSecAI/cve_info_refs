Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient input validation when passing user-supplied input to the database. Specifically, user-controlled parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple files:
    *   `install.php` via the `defaultCharacterSet` POST parameter.
    *   `rss.php` via the `where` GET parameter.
    *   `search.php` via the `sqlQuery` GET parameter.
*   The `extractWHEREclause()` function in `include.inc.php`, intended to filter out malicious SQL keywords, can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can directly read, write, and modify arbitrary data in the application's database.
*   The attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation** via HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to send crafted requests including malicious SQL queries in the specified parameters of the vulnerable scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in `rss.php`.
*   For the vulnerability in `install.php` the attacker has to know the correct MySQL credentials.
