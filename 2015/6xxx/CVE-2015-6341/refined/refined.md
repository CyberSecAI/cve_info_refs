- A vulnerability exists in the Web Management GUI of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is related to improper access control (CWE-264).
- It allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger client disconnections from the WLC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in the disconnection of wireless clients.
- This is categorized as a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, impacting the availability of the wireless network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
- The attack requires low complexity (AC:L), making it relatively easy to exploit.
- Authentication is not required (Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable WLC.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- Vulnerable WLC Software versions are 7.4(140.0) and 8.0(120.0).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 and temporal score of 4.8.
- The exploit is considered functional (E:F), indicating exploit code is available and works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
- There is a workaround available, which is to use CPU access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the Web Management GUI.
