- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper padding of Ethernet frames in Eaton's Cooper Power Systems Form 6 controls and Idea/IdeaPLUS relays. Instead of padding with zeros, the devices use data from memory, causing information leakage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a result of an IEEE conformance issue regarding improper frame padding. Specifically, sensitive information was not cleared before release in the data padding field of the Ethernet frame.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can passively observe the leaked data contained in the Ethernet packets sent by the affected devices. This can lead to information disclosure. The impact is limited to data leakage since this is a passive attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a receiver of the affected Ethernet packets or be on the network path to intercept them. This could occur on a local network that does not use encryption.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the network path or be the intended receiver of the packets from the vulnerable devices. Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
