Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6095:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure in the Windows Kerberos implementation to properly check password changes during user sign-in to a workstation. Specifically, it does not perform an additional authentication check prior to a password change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Security Feature Bypass:** The core issue is a security feature bypass in the Kerberos authentication process.
*   **Missing Authentication Check:** The absence of an additional authentication check when a password change is requested allows an attacker to potentially circumvent the standard Kerberos authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kerberos Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass Kerberos authentication on a targeted machine.
*   **BitLocker Decryption:** This bypass allows an attacker to decrypt drives protected by BitLocker if the specific conditions are met.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Kerberos KDC:** An attacker connects a workstation to a malicious Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). This KDC can then be used to trick the target system and bypass the authentication.
*   **Network-based:** The attack is primarily network-based as it requires redirecting Kerberos authentication requests to a malicious KDC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Control:** The attacker needs to have the ability to control or redirect Kerberos authentication traffic, implying some level of network control to act as a malicious KDC.
*   **Target System Requirements:** The target system must meet the following conditions:
    *   BitLocker is enabled without a PIN or USB key for pre-boot authentication.
    *   The machine is domain-joined.
    *   A domain user must be logged on to the target machine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The update addresses the issue by adding an additional authentication check that runs before any password change request is processed.
*   The initial bulletin indicated that the attacker needed physical access, but this was later removed as it was found not to be a strict requirement.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" across all affected Windows versions.
