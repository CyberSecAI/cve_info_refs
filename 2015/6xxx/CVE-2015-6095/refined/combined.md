## Security Update for Kerberos to Address Security Feature Bypass (3105256)

Published: November 10, 2015 | Updated: April 7, 2016

**Version:** 1.2

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a security feature bypass in Microsoft Windows. An attacker could bypass Kerberos authentication on a target machine and decrypt drives protected by BitLocker. The bypass can be exploited only if the target system has BitLocker enabled without a PIN or USB key and the computer is domain-joined.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the bypass by adding an additional authentication check that will run prior to a password change. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3105256](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3105256).

## Update FAQ

**Windows RT and Windows RT 8.1 are not listed in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered the 3101246 update?**

The vulnerable code exists in all supported versions of Windows, however the vulnerability cannot be exploited in systems running Windows RT or Windows RT 8.1. As a defense-in-depth measure the update has been implemented on all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable code.

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Kerberos Security Feature Bypass - CVE-2015-6095

A security feature bypass exists in Windows when Kerberos fails to check the password change of a user signing into a workstation. An attacker could bypass Kerberos authentication on a target machine and decrypt drives protected by BitLocker.

An attacker could bypass Kerberos authentication by connecting a workstation to a malicious Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).

The update addresses the bypass by adding an additional authentication check. Microsoft received information about the security feature bypass through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this bypass.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* This bypass can be exploited only if the target system has BitLocker enabled without a PIN or USB key.
* A domain user must be logged on to the target machine for the attack to succeed.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Security Update Deployment

For Security Update Deployment information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article referenced [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/library////c%28v%3DSecurity.10%29) in the Executive Summary.

## Acknowledgments

Microsoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. See [Acknowledgments](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn903755.aspx) for more information.

Microsoft disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, loss of business profits or special damages, even if Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## Revisions

* V1.0 (November 10, 2015): Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (December 9, 2015): Revised bulletin to remove all references to the requirement that an attacker have physical access to the target machine to exploit CVE-2015-6095. This is an informational change only. Customers who have already successfully installed the update do not need to take any action.
* V1.2 (April 7, 2016): Updated the footnotes following the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** table to further clarify installation order for security update 3101746 in MS15-115, 3081320 in MS15-121, and 3101246 in MS15-122. This is an informational change only. Customers who have already successfully installed the update do not need to take any action.
