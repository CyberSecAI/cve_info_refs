Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the web interface of the Bosch Security Systems Dinion NBN-498 camera. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to XML Injection via the `idstring` parameter in the `rcp.xml` endpoint. The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input provided in the idstring parameter which is then used within the XML response.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **XML Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XML injection. The provided proof of concept shows how arbitrary XML data can be injected using the `idstring` parameter.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The provided content does not specify the full extent of the impact but indicates that an attacker can inject arbitrary XML data. This can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the camera's functionality, settings or potentially disclose sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `rcp.xml` endpoint of the camera's web interface. Specifically, the `idstring` parameter within the request is used to inject malicious XML.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, which implies network access to the camera's web interface.

**Summary**
The provided exploit-db entry describes an XML injection vulnerability in the Bosch Security Systems Dinion NBN-498 IP camera's web interface. By manipulating the 'idstring' parameter in an HTTP request to `/rcp.xml`, an attacker can inject arbitrary XML code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the camera.
