## Security Update for Microsoft Office to Address Remote Code Execution (3116111)

Published: December 8, 2015 | Updated: December 18, 2015

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6040](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6040) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6118](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6118) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6122](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6122) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6124](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6124) | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6177](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6177) | No | No |

## Microsoft Office RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6172

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Outlook parses specially crafted email messages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user and take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, the user must open or preview a specially crafted email message with an affected version of Microsoft Outlook. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email message to the user and then convincing the user to preview or open the email.

Workstations and terminal servers on which Microsoft Outlook is install are at risk of this vulnerability. Servers could be more at risk if administrators allow users to log on to them to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Outlook parses specially crafted malicious email messages.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
