- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a SQL injection (CWE-89), which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker could execute unauthorized SQL queries. This could lead to the disclosure, modification, or deletion of sensitive data stored in the database. It could also potentially lead to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated (Au:S) to exploit this vulnerability.
