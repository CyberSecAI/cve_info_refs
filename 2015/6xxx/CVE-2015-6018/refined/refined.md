Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper input validation in the "PingIPAddr" parameter of the diagnostic ping function within the ZyXEL PMG5318-B20A router's firmware. Specifically, the router does not sanitize user input, allowing command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** The router fails to properly validate or sanitize the input provided to the `PingIPAddr` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution as Root:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with root privileges. This level of access allows the attacker to potentially:
    *   Dump sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/shadow` to obtain password hashes)
    *   Modify system configuration
    *   Gain full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/diagnostic/diagnostic_general.cgi` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated `PingIPAddr` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter `PingIPAddr` is embedded within the HTTP POST request, containing injected OS commands within the value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ZyXEL router's web management interface to send the malicious POST request. This could be from within the local network or, if the management interface is exposed to the internet, remotely as well.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `PingIPAddr` parameter

**Additional details:**
* The provided exploit example shows an attacker using a semi-colon to inject commands.
* The device is running underlying services as root, which enables the attacker to execute code at the root level.
