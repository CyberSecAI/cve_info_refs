Package        : openafs
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3282 CVE-2015-3283 CVE-2015-3284 CVE-2015-3285
                 CVE-2015-3287

It was discovered that OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed
filesystem AFS, contained several flaws that could result in
information leak, denial-of-service or kernel panic.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.

=== Content from www.openafs.org_ce6778a4_20250124_220811.html ===
Topic: Buffer overflow in OpenAFS vlserver
CVE-2015-6587
Issued: 29-July-2015
Last Update: 29-July-2015
Affected: OpenAFS versions through 1.6.12
A network user running a VL\_ListAttributesN2 RPC could attack
regular expression handling code in the vlserver.
SUMMARY
=======
The vlserver allows pattern matching on volume names via regular expressions
when listing attributes. Because the regular expression is not checked for
situations which can overflow the buffers used, an attack is possible which
reads arbitrary memory beyond the end of the buffer and can act on it
as part of the expression evaluation, potentially crashing the process.
IMPACT
======
A caller could cause a denial of service by causing a vlserver to evaluate
memory beyond was provided in the regular expression or exploit issues
in the local regular expression handling implementation.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
The vlserver executable in versions through 1.6.12 is affected.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators of fileservers upgrade
to OpenAFS version 1.6.13 or newer.
For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available directly from:
http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2015-006.patch
The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available from
http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html
This announcement and code patches related to it may be found on the
OpenAFS security advisory page at:
