Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6587:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the vlserver component of OpenAFS due to improper handling of regular expressions during volume attribute listing. Specifically, when processing the `VL_ListAttributesN2` RPC, the server does not adequately check the provided regular expressions for patterns that can lead to buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow within the regular expression handling code. The server uses a buffer to store and process the provided regular expression. However, if the expression is crafted in a specific way, it can cause the regular expression handling code to read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can cause the `vlserver` process to crash due to attempting to access memory outside of its bounds or by triggering issues within the regular expression handling library, thus rendering the OpenAFS file service unavailable.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability indicates a read beyond the buffer, it is possible this could lead to arbitrary code execution, if the attacker has further insight into memory layout and process execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** This vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the `VL_ListAttributesN2` RPC. An attacker can send a specially crafted RPC request containing a malicious regular expression designed to cause a buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send RPC requests to the OpenAFS `vlserver`. This implies the attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable `vlserver` process.
- **Knowledge of OpenAFS RPC:** Some level of knowledge of OpenAFS and the `VL_ListAttributesN2` RPC call would be necessary to construct the malicious regular expression.
