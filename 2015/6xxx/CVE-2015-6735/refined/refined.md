Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-6735:

*   **Vulnerability:** Resetting transcodes deleted the transcode without creating a new one.

*   **Root Cause:** A regression in the TimedMediaHandler extension caused the transcode table insertion to occur within the transcode job instead of during the job queue insertion. This resulted in the transcode being removed from the table when reset, preventing the new job from running and updating the transcode list.

*   **Attack Vector:** A user could reset the transcode of a media file.

*   **Impact:** This could be used for vandalism or potentially DoS, as users could delete all transcodes and no one could revert their actions, and by deleting transcodes, the resource becomes unavailable.

*   **Affected Component:** TimedMediaHandler extension for MediaWiki.
