Thanks for looking into this.  It seems like a reasonable approach if we can confirm it does the right thing.  This will need tests at two levels: ChildProcessSecurityPolicy has a pretty comprehensive set of unit tests, and we should add cases for the new method (and how it interacts with GrantScheme).  We should also add a test that tries to follow allowed and disallowed chrome:// URLs in a PDF, to show this fixes the problem.  (We should also run try jobs to confirm.)  Some comments and questions below, which might help simplify the change.

The reason was because the host constants are from different layers. content::kChromeUIResourcesHost is in the content layer, while chrome::kChromeUIFaviconHost and chrome::kChromeUIExtensionIconHost are in the chrome layer (so I moved them out here).  However, all of these permissions are really only needed in Chrome, so I can move it all to the chrome layer.

Thanks, this looks much better.  I see you mention on the bug that existing tests pass with this, so hopefully it won't regress the chrome.tabs behavior.

The issue behind this bug is that context menus allowed link URLs to go through that shouldn't. This only happened because of a problem within FilterURL, so I am testing that.  I originally created a PDF with these links on it, and was going to open context menus on them both and check the links that the menus picked up, but it turned out that writing the test that way was really finicky, and the context menus often didn't act as if they'd been opened on links even if they were opened in exactly the right spot. I feel like a test like that would also be really fragile in the future, because it relies upon the links being at set coordinates that could change easily if the layout of the pdf viewer ever changed.  I think this test should be sufficient for testing against the regression of this particular bug, and is also very reliable.

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/12/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, December 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 47 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 47.0.2526.73 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/46.0.2490.86..47.0.2526.73?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 47.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes **[41 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M47&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles).** Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [**Chromium security page**](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[563930](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=563930)] CVE-2015-6787: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.7 branch (currently 4.7.80.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [**AddressSanitizer**](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [**MemorySanitizer**](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# CVE-2015-6782

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-6781.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-6783.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-6782 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6782)

#### Description

The Document::open function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 does not ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal-dialog blocking, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof Omnibox content via a crafted web site.
