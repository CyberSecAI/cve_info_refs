Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) handles SSH keys for user accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of SSH keys allows for privilege escalation. The specific mechanism of this improper handling isn't detailed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can elevate their privileges on the system. This could lead to full control over the APIC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the vulnerable system is required. The attacker must have an existing local account (shell) on the Cisco APIC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows a local attacker who has authenticated access to the Cisco APIC system to elevate their privileges by exploiting the flawed SSH key handling mechanism.
