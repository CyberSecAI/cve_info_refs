Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `conntrackd` daemon in `conntrack-tools` versions 1.4.2 and earlier did not properly check if the necessary kernel modules for handling DCCP, SCTP, and ICMPv6 traffic were loaded before attempting to use them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation: The `conntrackd` daemon didn't verify the availability of required kernel modules before accessing attributes related to DCCP, SCTP, and ICMPv6 protocols, which are optional.
- Improper error handling: The code did not gracefully handle the case where the required kernel modules were not loaded, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending specially crafted packets using DCCP, SCTP, or ICMPv6, an attacker could cause `conntrackd` to crash. This crash would disrupt network connection tracking, potentially affecting services relying on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending malicious network traffic from a remote host.
- Specific protocols: The attack requires the use of DCCP, SCTP, or ICMPv6 packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a system running the vulnerable `conntrackd` daemon.
- Knowledge of protocols: The attacker would need to use specific protocols (DCCP, SCTP, or ICMPv6) in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involved adding checks to ensure that the required kernel modules were loaded and that the necessary attributes were present before trying to access them in the `build.c` file.
- The vulnerability was present in `conntrack-tools` version 1.4.2 and earlier
- The issue was fixed in the following versions:
    - Debian: `1:1.2.1-1+deb7u1` (wheezy), `1:1.4.2-2+deb8u1` (jessie), `1:1.4.2-3` (sid)
    - openSUSE: `1.4.2-4.4.1` (13.2), `1.4.2-2.3.1` (13.1)
    - SUSE: `1.4.2-5.2` , `1.4.4-1.29`, `1.4.5-1.46` (depending on product/version)
- The vulnerability is rated as having "moderate" severity.
- CVSS v2 score is 5.0 with vector AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P, indicating network-based, low complexity, unauthenticated access, and partial availability impact
