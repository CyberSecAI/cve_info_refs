Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6519

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection (SQLi) flaw.
- It exists within the "members.php" file, specifically when the `action` parameter is set to `signup`.
- The `showemail` POST parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the `showemail` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
- Potential impacts include:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database).
    - Data modification (inserting, updating, or deleting data).
    - Potential for further compromise (depending on the database user privileges and application logic).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to `members.php?action=signup`.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `showemail` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- No special privileges within the application itself are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
-  The exploit example provided uses a common error-based SQL injection technique, leveraging `CONCAT` and `FLOOR(RAND(0)*2)` to trigger database error output, potentially revealing database version information.
- The provided exploit string: `1' AND (SELECT 1212 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables GROUP BY x)a) AND 'ali-ahmady'='ali-ahmady` is an error-based SQL injection payload designed to expose the database version.

The provided information offers a good level of detail regarding the vulnerability and its exploitation.
