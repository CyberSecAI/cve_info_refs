Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in Cisco Unity Connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection in Cisco Unity Connection. This allows an attacker to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of a legitimate user without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute unwanted actions, potentially modifying the system's configuration or performing actions that the user is authorized to do but without their awareness.
* The impact on integrity is partial as stated by the CVSS score which implies an attacker could modify some system files or information.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack is network-based (AV:N) and requires the attacker to lure a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker exploits the trust the system has in the authenticated user's browser.
* The attack requires medium complexity (AC:M), suggesting that the user may need to be tricked into taking action for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the targeted Cisco Unity Connection server.
* The attacker needs to trick a user with an active, authenticated session with Cisco Unity Connection to unwittingly execute the malicious request. This is typically achieved through social engineering.
* The attacker does not require any authentication with the Cisco Unity Connection to exploit this vulnerability (Au:N).

**Additional Details:**
* The affected product is Cisco Unity Connection version 11.5(0.98).
* The vulnerability is identified with CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
* The vulnerability is given a base CVSS score of 4.3 and temporal score of 4.1.
* Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the described vulnerability.
* A workaround for users is to verify that unsolicited links are safe to follow.
