Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS) devices handle TCP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper TCP connection handling, leading to excessive CPU and memory utilization.
*   CWE-119:  Likely a buffer overflow or related memory corruption issue when handling TCP packets or connection states, as it's mapped to CWE-119

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can disable TCP ports, rendering the VTS device unable to provide its intended service. This is achieved through excessive consumption of CPU and memory resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable VTS device.
*   No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS) Releases 2.0(0) and 2.0(1) are vulnerable.
*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
    *   Temporal Score: 4.8 (E:F/RL:U/RC:C)
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available.
*   **Fixed Software:** Upgrade to a patched version of the software
*   **Public Announcement:** Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use at the time of the advisory.
