Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `microtime()` as a seed for the random number generator (`srand`) in the `simple-php-captcha.php` script. This is problematic because `microtime()` is also used to generate the CAPTCHA image URL sent to the client. Consequently, the client can use the same `microtime()` value to seed their own random number generator and reproduce the exact same CAPTCHA code and image generated by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Seed:** The primary weakness is the use of a predictable seed (based on `microtime()`) for the random number generator used to create the CAPTCHA code.
*   **Replicated Logic:**  The CAPTCHA generation logic is replicated between server and client by using the same seed, making it possible for an attacker to bypass the CAPTCHA entirely without using OCR.
*  **Use of `rand()`:** The "fixed" version relies on PHP's automatic seeding for `rand()`, which is typically dependent on system time, adding only a process ID to the mix. The code uses `rand()` so many times that it leaks its internal state through easy-to-analyze properties of the captcha. The documentation also states `rand()` should not be used for cryptographic purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete CAPTCHA Bypass:** An attacker can completely bypass the CAPTCHA mechanism by generating the correct CAPTCHA code client-side. This allows them to automate actions that the CAPTCHA is intended to prevent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Replication:** The attacker replicates the server's CAPTCHA generation logic client-side, using the `microtime()` value extracted from the CAPTCHA image URL.
* **Analysis of "Metadata"**: By analysing the captcha's "metadata" through easy means an attacker can infer the text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to CAPTCHA Image URL:** The attacker needs access to the CAPTCHA image URL, which is typically available in the HTML source of the page containing the CAPTCHA.
*   **Basic Understanding of PHP:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of PHP to be able to replicate the server-side logic.
* **Knowledge of how to analyze images**: The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to analyze properties of an image to use the `rand()` weakness.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported in [Issue #16](https://github.com/yasirmturk/simple-php-captcha/issues/16) of the `simple-php-captcha` repository.
*   A fix was implemented by switching from `rand()` to `mt_rand()` which provides a better PRNG, as shown in [Commit 9d65a94](https://github.com/yasirmturk/simple-php-captcha/commit/9d65a945029c7be7bb6bc893759e74c5636be694). However the use of `rand()` still leaves the system vulnerable via other means.
* The original issue used `srand(microtime() * 100)` which, especially with good time synchronization, allows the client to run the same srand call as the server.
* The maintainers had a discussion about what constitutes a valid vulnerability report.
