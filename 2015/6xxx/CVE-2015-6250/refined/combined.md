## Description

[![@ProloG-Shaman](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359715?v=4&size=48)](/ProloG-Shaman)[ProloG-Shaman](https://github.com/ProloG-Shaman)opened [on Jul 30, 2015](https://github.com/yasirmturk/simple-php-captcha/issues/16#issue-98282624)

The simple-php-captcha.php file has a vulnerability enabling a client to generate the captcha response automatically, effectively bypassing the captcha.

Since microtime() is used both in the initial seed for the captcha and in the captcha url path sent to the client, it is possible to generate the captcha result automatically by running the same code client-side.

I can share a proof of concept privately if you need it. Just let me know how to reach you.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Use CVE-2015-6250 for the original issue that the "srand(microtime() *
100)" call is counterproductive because, especially in cases of good
time synchronization, the client is able to run the same srand call as
the server.

>> From: Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com>

>> And you think removing the srand(microtime() * 100) fixes this?  Well,

As far as we can tell, neither
<https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha> nor
<http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/simple-php-captcha/> has any statement
of what the intended level of security is. The basic situation seems
to be that someone has written a few hundred lines of code, produced a
CAPTCHA-related product that is described as "simple" and has a set of
security-relevant behaviors that are quite different from those of
more advanced CAPTCHA code, and needs to be given a reasonable level
of latitude in deciding what bug reports will be accepted as
vulnerability reports rather than suggestions for enhancements.

Our guess is that using the PHP rand function, given that
<http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php> says "Caution ... This
function does not generate cryptographically secure values, and should
not be used for cryptographic purposes" (and given that the properties
of rand are otherwise somewhat well known), might be unintended and
might be considered an obviously valid vulnerability report.
Alternatively, one might consider it a PHP problem that the
documentation is phrased in that way, and not phrased as something
like "This function does not generate secure values, and there are
many, many cases in which it should not be used at all."
