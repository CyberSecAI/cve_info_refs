Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Windows validates input before loading libraries, specifically when handling delay-loaded DLLs. An attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as a vulnerable application or document, leading to its unintended loading. The vulnerability is triggered when a COM object attempts to load a delay-loaded DLL, using `LoadLibraryExA`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Planting:** The primary vulnerability is DLL planting or DLL hijacking, where a malicious DLL is placed in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate application or process, due to how Windows searches for libraries.
- **Improper Input Validation:** Windows does not properly validate the DLL path before loading a library, specifically when delay-loading, which leads to an attacker being able to control the loaded library path.
- **Delay-Loaded DLLs:** The vulnerability is triggered during the delay-load process of DLLs by COM objects.
- **COM Object Handling:** The use of a specially crafted OLE object triggers the vulnerable code path in the comsvcs.dll, using a specific CLSID (`ecabafc9-7f19-11d2-978e-0000f8757e2a`), leading to the delay load of mqrt.dll.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Complete Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Lateral Movement:** The attacker could potentially use compromised machines as a pivot point for lateral movement within a network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted OLE Object:** Embedding a malicious OLE object in a document, such as a Microsoft Word document, is an attack vector. The object's CLSID points to `comsvcs.dll` and triggers the delay-load vulnerability.
- **RTF Document:** A specially crafted RTF document that uses the vulnerable CLSID can also trigger the DLL load, without requiring any user interaction.
- **File System Planting:** Placing the malicious DLL (e.g., `mqrt.dll`) in the same directory as the vulnerable application or document is crucial for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local system where the vulnerable application or document is opened.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable application or document and have it loaded.
- **Crafting Malicious Objects:**  The attacker needs to be capable of crafting or modifying OLE objects with specific CLSIDs to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit requires a malicious DLL to be placed in the same directory as the document. The supplied POC contains a `mqrt.dll`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through user interaction (single click on an embedded object) or without user interaction by using a RTF document.
- The vulnerability is related to library loading, and the specific DLL that triggers the vulnerability (e.g. `mqrt.dll`) might differ, but the root cause and attack vector are the same.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows including Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2.
