Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `prctl_set_vma_anon_name` function within the kernel. This function could attempt to set the name across two different Virtual Memory Areas (VMAs) simultaneously due to a typo.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A race condition vulnerability exists. The typo causes the system to attempt to set the name across multiple VMAs at the same time.
- VMA list corruption: the concurrent attempt to set the name to multiple VMAs could lead to corruption in the VMA list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the kernel.
-  Device compromise:  local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local malicious application: An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. This application would exploit the vulnerability in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the target device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
- The fix involves limiting the name setting operation to a single VMA at a time, using a temporary variable (tmp) instead of the end to prevent concurrent attempts to modify different VMAs.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0, 5.1.1, and 6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yabin Cui from Android Bionic Team.
