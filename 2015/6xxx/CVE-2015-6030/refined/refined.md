Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6030:

**Root Cause:**

*   Several key files for ArcSight are owned by the `arcsight` user but are executed with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-653: Insufficient Compartmentalization:**  The core issue is that the system does not properly isolate the privileges of the `arcsight` user from root. Files and commands associated with the `arcsight` user are being executed with root level privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A user who has the credentials for the `arcsight` account can escalate their privileges to root. This allows them to execute commands with full system privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local. An attacker must first gain access to the `arcsight` user account in order to exploit the privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the `arcsight` user account.
*   The attacker must have access to the affected system where the vulnerable files are located.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to affect HP ArcSight Logger 6.0.0.7307.1, ArcSight Command Center 6.8.0.1896.0, and ArcSight Connector Appliance 6.4.0.6881.3. ArcSight SmartConnector for UNIX-like systems might also be affected.
*   The document notes that the severity is lessened as the arcsight credentials are only expected to be known to system administrators. However, the document does acknowledge the severity would increase if there were an alternate method to obtain the arcsight credentials.
