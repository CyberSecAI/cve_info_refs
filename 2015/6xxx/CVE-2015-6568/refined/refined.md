  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "Wolf CMS 0.8.2 is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload, leading to command execution. This occurs due to a lack of proper restrictions on file uploads within the file manager plugin. Any registered user with upload access can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, which can then be executed on the server.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient validation and filtering of uploaded files in the file manager plugin. Specifically, the application does not restrict the upload of executable file types (such as PHP), allowing malicious users to upload and execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted File Upload",
       "Lack of Input Validation",
        "Insufficient File Type Filtering"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is severe, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, service disruption, or further attacks on other systems.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based file upload",
      "Direct HTTP request"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a registered user account with upload access within the Wolf CMS application. This can be a regular user account, and the attacker doesn't need to have administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.  They must also know the vulnerable URL to upload a file to",
