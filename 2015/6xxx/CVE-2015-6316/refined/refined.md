Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of a default `oracle` account with a known static password in the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-255:** Storing credentials in a way that allows unauthorized access, specifically the use of a default, static password for the `oracle` account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can log into the MSE using the default `oracle` account. Although this account doesn't have full administrator privileges, it still grants access that should be restricted. This access could potentially be leveraged to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Authentication:** The attacker leverages the default, static credentials for the `oracle` account, thus bypassing normal authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Cisco MSE device.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the default username (`oracle`) and its associated static password.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) versions 8.0.120.7 and earlier.
- A workaround is provided which disables SSH login for the oracle user by adding "DenyUsers oracle" to the sshd_config file.
- The fix involves upgrading to a version later than 8.0.120.7.
- Indicators of compromise include the presence of SSH logins using the `oracle` account in the system logs.
- The CVSS score is provided as Base 6.5, Temporal 5.4 and Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
