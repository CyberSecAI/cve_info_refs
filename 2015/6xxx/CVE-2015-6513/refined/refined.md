Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the `sortby` parameter of the product search functionality and the `manufacturer_ids[]` parameter of the advanced search form. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to both boolean-blind and error-based SQL injection attacks.
    *   The `sortby` parameter in the product search is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
    *   The `manufacturer_ids[]` parameter in the advanced search is also vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, product details, or other confidential data.
*   **Account Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can enumerate users and potentially gain access to user accounts by extracting password hashes.
*  **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files via SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/index.php` endpoint.
    *   For the `sortby` vulnerability, the attacker modifies the `sortby` parameter within the request.
    *   For the `manufacturer_ids[]` vulnerability, the attacker modifies the `manufacturer_ids[]` parameter within the multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance. No special privileges are needed.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities are unauthenticated and can be exploited by any attacker with network access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes Metasploit modules for exploitation which provides more detailed information on how to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on July 7, 2015, and a fix was released on July 8, 2015 (version 3.1.7).
