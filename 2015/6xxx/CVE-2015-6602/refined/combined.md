Following our [discovery](/experts-found-a-unicorn-in-the-heart-of-android/) of vulnerabilities in the Stagefright library in April, Zimperium Mobile Threat Protection, zLabs VP of Research [Joshua J. Drake](https://www.twitter.com/jduck) continued researching media processing in Android. His continued research, which focused on remote attacks against current devices, led to the discovery of yet another security issue.

Meet Stagefright 2.0, a set of two vulnerabilities that manifest when processing specially crafted MP3 audio or MP4 video files. The first vulnerability (in libutils) impacts almost every Android device since version 1.0 released in 2008. We found methods to trigger that vulnerability in devices running version 5.0 and up using the second vulnerability (in libstagefright). Google assigned CVE-2015-6602 to vulnerability in libutils. We plan to share CVE information for the second vulnerability as soon as it is available.

What is the impact of this issue?

* Confirmed remote code execution (RCE) impact via libstagefright on Android 5.0 and later.
* Older devices may be impacted if the vulnerable function in libutils is used (using third party apps, vendor or carrier functionality pre-loaded to the phone).

What is the vulnerability ?

Processing specially crafted MP3 or MP4 files can lead to arbitrary code execution.

How the attack can be triggered ?

The vulnerability lies in the processing of metadata within the files, so merely previewing the song or video would trigger the issue. Since the primary attack vector of MMS has been removed in newer versions of Google’s Hangouts and Messenger apps, the likely attack vector would be via the Web browser.

1. An attacker would try to convince an unsuspecting user to visit a URL pointing at an attacker controlled Web site (e.g., mobile spear-phishing or malicious ad campaign)
2. An attacker on the same network could inject the exploit using common traffic interception techniques (MITM) to unencrypted network traffic destined for the browser.
3. 3rd party apps (Media Players, Instant Messengers, etc.) that are using the vulnerable library.

How is Zimperium responding to these issues?

We notified the Android Security Team of this issue on August 15th. Per usual, they responded quickly and moved to remediate. They assigned CVE-2015-6602 to the libutils issue but have yet to provide us with a CVE number to track the second issue. We would like to thank Google for their cooperation for promptly including the fix in the upcoming Nexus Security Bulletin scheduled to be released next week.

Empowering end users and ZHA partners

At this point, we do not plan to share a proof-of-concept exploit for this new vulnerability with the general public. Once a patch is available, we will update our [Stagefright Detector app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zimperium.stagefrightdetector&hl=en) to  detect this vulnerability.

After reporting this vulnerability to Google we sent an update to our Zimperium Handset Alliance ([ZHA](/zha-zimperiums-initiative-to-fill-the-gaps-in-android-security/)) partners. We are planning to share proof-of-concept code with verified [ZHA](/zha-zimperiums-initiative-to-fill-the-gaps-in-android-security/) members  later this month. We encourage vendors to update their Android devices to incorporate the fix as soon as possible.

Impacting the ecosystem

As more and more researchers have explored various vulnerabilities that exist within the Stagefright library and associated libraries, we expect to see more vulnerabilities in the same area. Many researchers in the community have said Google has replied to their reported bugs saying that they were duplicate or already discovered internally.

The research provided by Zimperium in this area has been a catalyst for change. Following our initial Stagefright announcement, industry-leading vendors made a clear statement that security updates will be provided on a monthly basis. So far, two monthly Nexus Security Bulletins have already posted. Next week will be the third.

Detecting attacks with z9

At the heart of all Zimperium technology is our z9 engine, which has been trained with the capability to detect media processing attacks through all attack vectors. No additional update is required to detect this new pair of vulnerabilities. We are diligently monitoring sources for in-the-wild attacks.

Researchers at Zimperium have reported two new Stagefright vulnerabilities affecting one billion Android devices.

When researcher Joshua Drake published details in August about [critical Android vulnerabilities in the Stagefright media playback engine](https://threatpost.com/android-stagefright-flaws-put-950-million-devices-at-risk/113960/), he promised there would be more issues that he and others would find and report to Google’s Android security team.

Today, Drake, vice president of platform research and exploitation at Zimperium, disclosed two more flaws in Stagefright, one that dates back to the first version of Android, and a second dependent vulnerability that was introduced in Android 5.0. The bugs affect more than one billion Android devices, essentially all of them in circulation.

While the first [Stagefright flaw was patched](https://threatpost.com/google-plans-monthly-security-updates-for-nexus-phones/114148/) in short order by Google and deployed by carriers and handset makers, updates for these two vulnerabilities are not yet available to the general public. A Google spokesperson told Threatpost today that the patches were provided to partners on Sept. 10. The patches will be rolled out to Nexus users and included in the next monthly Android security update scheduled for Oct. 5. The patches were also, inadvertently, pushed to the Android Open Source Project (ASOP), said Zuk Avraham, chairman and founder of Zimperium.

The risks with these vulnerabilities, dubbed Stagefright 2.0, are nearly identical to the original Stagefright flaws; the only difference is that the attack vector for the first bugs has been patched. Successful exploits would enable remote code execution and lead to privilege escalation, putting an attacker in control over a compromised device. They would have access to personal data and photos stored on the phone, be able to take photos, record conversations, exfiltrate email and SMS/MMS messages and load additional apps.

“It’s as dangerous as Stagefright 1.0,” said Avraham, who added that Zimperium is not aware of public exploits of these issues. But given that one of the bugs has been in Android since the very beginning, it’s likely they could have been used in an attack.

Stagefright 1.0, however, was exploited via a specially crafted MMS message which were at the time automatically processed by Stagefright. Google’s patch means Stagefright no longer does so, especially in new versions of Google’s Messenger and Hangouts apps. With Stagefright 2.0, Avraham said the most logical attack vector would be the mobile browser where an attacker tricks the victim via phishing or malvertising to visit a URL hosting the exploit. An attacker could also inject the exploit via a man-in-the-middle attack, or host a malicious third-party app that uses the vulnerable library.

Like the first set of attacks, Stagefright 2.0 exploits are a way onto the phone. Stagefright is granted some system-level privileges, giving the attacker the opportunity to elevate their privileges with additional attacks in order to control the device.

“It’s a library that was written very badly,” Avraham said of Stagefright. “The library itself is pretty vulnerable; it has a lot of code mistakes. The media processing is not as safe as it should be.”

One of the vulnerabilities has been assigned CVE-2015-6602 and was found in a core Android library called libutils; it has been in the Android OS since it was first released and before there were even Android mobile devices. The second vulnerability was introduced into libstagefright in Android 5.0; it calls into libutils in a vulnerable way, Avraham said. An attacker would use a specially crafted MP3 or MP4 file in this case to exploit the vulnerabilities.

The libutils vulnerability is critical because it could extend into many areas of Android.

“Determining all possible ways that a core library component has been used across the Android ecosystem is an insurmountable task,” said a FAQ published by Zimperium. “Every piece of code that uses the vulnerable library needs to be inspected to see if it calls APIs within libutils in a vulnerable way. Then, each potentially vulnerable use would need to be inspected and analyzed individually.”

The libstagefright issue affects apps that utilize Android’s multimedia APIs, which call into the library.

“In each case, the vulnerable code runs inside mediaserver,” Zimperium said.

Stagefright 1.0 was disclosed during presentations given by Drake at Black Hat and DEF CON in August. The original exploits were particularly worrisome given that an attacker need only know the victim’s phone number in order send a crafted MMS message to a phone to trigger the vulnerability without user interaction; an attacker could also delete the MMS before the victim was it aware it was sent.

[Stagefright is an over-privileged application](http://blog.zimperium.com/experts-found-a-unicorn-in-the-heart-of-android/) with system access on some devices, which enables privileges similar to apps with root access. Stagefright is used to process a number of common media formats, and it’s implemented in native C++ code, making it simpler to exploit.

“On some devices, [Stagefright] has access to the system group, which is right next to root—very close to root—so it should be easy to get root from system,” Drake told Threatpost in July. “And system runs a lot of stuff. You’d be able to monitor communication on the device and do nasty things.

“That process, you would think, would be sandboxed and locked down as much as it could because it’s processing dangerous, risky code, but it actually has access to the Internet,” Drake said. “Android has a group enforcement where it allows [Stagefright] to connect to the Internet. This service is on all Android devices. I’d rather not have a service that’s doing risky processing have Internet access.”
