Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6602:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the `libutils` library, a core Android component, due to improper processing of metadata within specially crafted MP3 or MP4 files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of metadata within MP3 or MP4 files.
- The `libutils` library has a code flaw that makes it vulnerable to processing specially crafted media files.
-  The library has "a lot of code mistakes" and is considered "badly written" making the media processing unsafe.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- Privilege escalation: After gaining initial access, an attacker can further escalate privileges to gain more control of the device.
- Full device compromise: Attackers could gain access to personal data, photos, take photos, record conversations, exfiltrate emails and SMS/MMS messages, and install additional apps.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web browser:** An attacker can trick a user into visiting a malicious website hosting the exploit.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** An attacker on the same network could inject the exploit into unencrypted web traffic.
- **Third-party applications:** Apps that use the vulnerable `libutils` library or Android's multimedia APIs can be exploited.
- Initial attack vector of MMS messages (used in the original Stagefright) is no longer effective due to updates in messaging apps.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft malicious MP3 or MP4 files.
- Ability to host the malicious media files or inject them into network traffic.
- For web browser attack, the attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious URL.
- For MITM attacks, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability in `libutils` has existed since the first version of Android.
-  A second vulnerability exists in `libstagefright` (not the primary focus of CVE-2015-6602) that can trigger the libutils issue in Android 5.0 and later.
- The vulnerable code runs inside the `mediaserver` process.
- The `libutils` vulnerability is considered critical because it is a core library used across the Android ecosystem, making it difficult to determine all vulnerable uses.
- The Stagefright library (which includes `libutils`) has access to system level privileges, close to root access.

This information provides more detail than the standard CVE description, outlining the attack vectors, potential impact and the root cause of the vulnerability, as well as the affected components.
