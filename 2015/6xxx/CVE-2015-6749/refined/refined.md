  "CVE-2015-6749": {
    "description": "Buffer overflow in the aiff_open function in oggenc/audio.c in vorbis-tools 1.4.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted AIFF file.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The `aiff_open` function in `oggenc/audio.c` uses `alloca` to allocate a buffer based on the length specified in the AIFF file's 'COMM' chunk. If this length is excessively large, it can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow",
          "Unvalidated Input"
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service (crash) due to a buffer overflow. Potential for arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly stated, the overflow is stack-based and may be exploitable.",
        "attack_vector": "A specially crafted AIFF file must be opened using `oggenc`.",
          "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted AIFF file to the vulnerable `oggenc` program.",
          "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `fread` function attempts to read data into the buffer of the size controlled by the attacker via the crafted AIFF file."
