Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6397:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a default account on the Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W routers being incorrectly granted *root* privileges at authentication time under a specific configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment:** A default account is given excessive *root* privileges upon authentication.
*   **Static Credential:** The advisory title mentions "Static Credential" which implies the use of hardcoded credentials in the vulnerable devices. Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, it can be implied this vulnerability is also related to static, easily exploitable credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain *root* access to the affected device. This means they have complete control over the router.
*   Full control over the router allows attackers to modify configurations, intercept traffic, create backdoors, perform denial of service attacks and potentially use compromised devices as entry points to wider networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, especially if the "remote management" feature of the device is enabled.
*   **Authentication Required:** Although remote, an attacker still needs to authenticate. This likely requires exploiting the weak/static credentials mentioned in the advisory title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device which can be over the internet or local network depending on the device configuration (remote management enabled/disabled).
*   **Authentication Credentials:** The attacker needs the static credentials of the vulnerable default account.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router for all firmware versions before the fix versions.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.0 and a temporal score of 7.4, indicating a critical severity.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability apart from upgrading the firmware
*   **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is resolved in specific firmware releases: RV110W (1.2.1.7), RV130W (1.0.3.16), and RV215W (1.3.0.8)
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by an external researcher, Adam Zielinski.
*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-287: Improper Authentication.
