Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2015-6305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insufficient fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2015-4211). The fix aimed to verify the signature and filename of the `vpndownloader.exe`, however it did not restrict the location from where the executable can be run.
*  This allows a local attacker to perform DLL side-loading attack by placing malicious DLLs in the same directory as a copy of the legitimate `vpndownloader.exe`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL side-loading:** The `vpndownloader.exe` loads DLLs from its working directory, allowing an attacker to inject malicious DLLs that will be loaded with elevated privileges.
*   **Lack of Path Restriction:** The vulnerable process does not check if `vpndownloader.exe` is executed from a secure directory like "Program Files," opening the door to attacks using copies placed in arbitrary directories.
*   **Potential Race Condition:** While not the primary attack vector described, the provided information mentions that symbolic links could potentially be used in a race condition to swap the executable after verification has completed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This means the attacker can completely control the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** The attacker must have write access to a location on the local file system where they can place the malicious DLL along with a copy of the `vpndownloader.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to the local filesystem.
*  **Knowledge of target software**: The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable executable, as well as any libraries that it loads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The specific vulnerable version identified is Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows version 3.1.08009.
*   The exploit was tested on 32-bit Windows but is expected to work on 64-bit systems as well.
*   A proof of concept is available that demonstrates the vulnerability by copying `cmd.exe` to the user's desktop and running it as SYSTEM.
*   The exploit works by copying the original executable to a writable directory, placing a malicious `dbghelp.dll` (or another loaded DLL) in the same directory and running the copied executable.
*   Cisco released bug ID CSCuv01279, available to registered users, with more details and an updated list of affected versions.
