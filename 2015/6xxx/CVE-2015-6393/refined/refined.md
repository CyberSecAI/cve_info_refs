The provided content relates to CVE-2015-6393.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the DHCPv4 relay agent in Cisco NX-OS Software. It's triggered by the processing of malformed DHCPv4 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed DHCPv4 packets by the DHCP relay agent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected Cisco NX-OS device. The device will reload and generate a core file for the DHCP process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can send malformed DHCPv4 packets to the device.
- Attackers can use either the IPv4 broadcast address or the IPv4 unicast address of any interface configured on the device as the destination address of the malicious packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the affected device.
- The device must have DHCPv4 relay agent enabled.
