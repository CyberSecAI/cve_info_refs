Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6734:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cssgen.php` script within the `contrib` directory of the `SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi` extension for MediaWiki. Specifically, the `keywords-1` parameter was not sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious code in the `keywords-1` parameter of the `cssgen.php` script.
   - `/extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/geshi/contrib/cssgen.php?step=3&keywords-1=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on this malicious URL.

**Additional details:**
- The `contrib` directory for GeSHi was inadvertently re-included in MediaWiki 1.25.
- The vulnerable script `cssgen.php` was located in the `contrib` directory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by DAU Huy Ngoc.
- The fix involved removing all scripts from the contrib directory.
- This XSS vulnerability exists in `cssgen.php` file which is not listed in the upstream GeSHi project's commit history, indicating it is a MediaWiki specific issue.
