Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a possible integer overflow in the handling of `extendedHeaderSize` and `paddingSize`. This likely occurs when processing media files or data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code does not properly validate or sanitize the size values (`extendedHeaderSize` and `paddingSize`), which could lead to an integer overflow. This can result in writing beyond allocated memory.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The integer overflow can lead to memory corruption in the `mediaserver` process when processing the crafted media file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability can permit a bypass of security measures in place designed to make exploitation of the platform more difficult. It could also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to gain elevated capabilities such as `Signature` or `SignatureOrSystem` permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Media File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of specially crafted media files.
- **Multiple Attack Methods:** The vulnerability could be exploited via multiple vectors, including email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted Media File:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted media file containing the malicious `extendedHeaderSize` and `paddingSize` values that could cause an integer overflow.
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the various methods like email, MMS, and web browsing. This implies a network-based attack.
