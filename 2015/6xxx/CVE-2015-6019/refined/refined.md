**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker may be able to utilize session information to gain access to the device even after the legitimate user has logged off. This could lead to unauthorized access and modification of system configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to gain access to a valid session after the user has logged off. This could potentially be done by intercepting network traffic or by other means of gaining access to session data.
