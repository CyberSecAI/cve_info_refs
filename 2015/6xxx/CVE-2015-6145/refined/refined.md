- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights, including administrative rights if the user is logged in with such privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise: installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.  Attackers would need to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or control content on a website or send emails/messages to convince a user to visit a malicious site through Internet Explorer.
