Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6402

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the web-based management interface of the Cisco EPC3928 Wireless Residential Gateway.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the web interface. User-supplied data, such as the system name, is not properly validated before being stored and rendered in the interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (CWE-79):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the system through user-provided fields (e.g., when changing the system name) and stored persistently. This code will execute when other users access the affected page in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser when they access the web interface.
- This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies, gaining access to the user's session and potentially the device's administration panel.
    - **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - **Malware Delivery:** Attackers could potentially use the XSS to inject malicious scripts that download and execute malware on the user's machine.
    - **Defacement:** The attacker could modify displayed content or redirect users to different pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web-based management interface of the Cisco EPC3928 Wireless Residential Gateway.
- An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious HTTP POST request containing the XSS payload through a vulnerable field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface. This can be done remotely if the web interface is exposed to the internet, or locally if the attacker is on the same network.
- No authentication is required to exploit the stored XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB Content:**
- The exploit-db content provides example HTTP requests that can be used to trigger the vulnerability, along with example responses.
- It also notes that other vulnerabilities exist in the device.

**CVSS Score:**
- The CVSS v2 Base Score is 4.3 and Temporal Score is 4.1. The vector string is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C which translates to:
    -   AV:N (Network) - The attack can be launched remotely
    -   AC:M (Medium) - The attack requires some level of specific conditions
    -   Au:N (None) - No authentication is required
    -   C:N (None) - There is no impact to confidentiality
    -   I:P (Partial) - There is a partial impact to integrity
    -   A:N (None) - There is no impact to availability
    -   E:F (Functional) - Functional exploit code is available.
    -   RL:U (Unavailable) - There is no solution available or it is impossible to apply
    -   RC:C (Confirmed) - The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor.

**Note:** The content from exploit-db.com contains information on other vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-1337, CVE-2016-1336, CVE-2016-1328, CVE-2015-6401) affecting the same product, but they are not relevant to this CVE (CVE-2015-6402)
