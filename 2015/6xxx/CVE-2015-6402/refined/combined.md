# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 4.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 4.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 4.1 |

========

Summary:
In recent security research, Secorda security team has found multiple vulnerabilities affecting Cisco EPC3928 Wireless Residential Gateway. Variants of this product can also be affected.
Using combination of several vulnerabilities, attacker is able to remotely download and decode boot configuration file, which you can see on PoC video below. The attacker is also able to reconfigure device in order to perform attacks on the home-user, inject additional data to modem http response or extract sensitive informations from the device, such as the Wi-Fi key.

Until Cisco releases workarounds or patches, we recommend verify access to the web-based management panel and make sure that it is not reachable from the external network.

Vulnerabilities:
1) Unauthorized Command Execution
2) Gateway Stored XSS
3) Gateway Client List DoS
4) Gateway Reflective XSS
5) Gateway HTTP Corruption DoS
6) "Stored" HTTP Response Injection
7) Boot Information Disclosure

- "Stored" HTTP Response Injection

It is able to inject additional HTTP data to response, if string parameter of LanguageSelect won't be too long (in that case device will crash).
Additional data will be stored in device memory and returned with every http response on port 80 until reboot.

- Boot Information Disclosure

In early booting phase, for a short period of time some administrator functions can be executed, and it is able to extract device configuration file. We wrote an exploit that crash the modem, and then retrieve and decode config in order to obtain users credentials.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
