Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs when Internet Explorer notifies Mutation Observers of changes to a document's character data. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can cause a CTreePos object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: A memory corruption vulnerability where freed memory is accessed.
- Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer when notifying Mutation Observers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the system, including installing programs, modifying data, or creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a specially crafted webpage.
- User interaction is required; a user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- Attackers may host malicious web pages or inject malicious code into compromised websites or user-provided content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious web page or inject malicious code.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 11 on Windows clients and servers.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the advisory.
- This vulnerability is part of a larger group of memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-124.
