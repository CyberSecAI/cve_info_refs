Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated SQL injection flaw present in the `get_album_item.php` file of the WP Symposium WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `size` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize or properly escape user-supplied input in the `size` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can retrieve all the database content, which includes user details and password hashes.
    *   Cracked password hashes can allow an attacker to log in as legitimate users.
    *   If an administrator's password is compromised, the attacker can gain complete control of the WordPress installation.
    *   The extracted data may enable further attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based, using HTTP requests.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `size` parameter in a request to the `get_album_item.php` file.
    *   The exploit can be initiated by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning no prior login or authorization is needed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
    *   No specific user privileges or prior knowledge are required.
    *   The attacker can be external to the network.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability exists in versions of WP Symposium up to and including 15.5.1.
    *   The exploit works even if the plugin is deactivated.
    *   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to retrieve the MySQL version number, which verifies the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   The vulnerability was patched in version 15.8.
