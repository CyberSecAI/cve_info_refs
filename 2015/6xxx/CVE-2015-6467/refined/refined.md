The provided content is an ICS advisory that details multiple vulnerabilities in Advantech WebAccess, including CVE-2015-6467.

**CVE-2015-6467 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** External Control of File Name or Path
*   **Weakness:** WebAccess can be made to run remote code through the use of a browser plug-in. This means an attacker can control the file path or name, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker may be able to achieve remote code execution by exploiting this vulnerability. However, the CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and availability (C:N/I:L/A:N), meaning the main risk is integrity, with the potential for the attacker to modify data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based (AV:N)
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) on the target system and no user interaction (UI:N) is required to perform the attack.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Identified in the Advisory:**

The advisory also describes other vulnerabilities, with CVEs assigned, including:

*   **CVE-2016-0851:** Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
*   **CVE-2016-0854:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
*   **CVE-2016-0855:** Path Traversal
*   **CVE-2016-0856:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow
*   **CVE-2016-0857:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow
*   **CVE-2016-0858:** Race Condition
*   **CVE-2016-0859:** Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
*   **CVE-2016-0860:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
*  **CVE-2016-0852:** Improper Access Control
*   **CVE-2016-0853:** Improper Input Validation
*   **CVE-2015-3948:** Cross-Site Scripting
*   **CVE-2015-3947:** SQL Injection
*   **CVE-2015-3946:** Cross-Site Request Forgery
*   **CVE-2015-3943:** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

These vulnerabilities range in impact from information disclosure to remote code execution, affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Mitigation:**
The advisory recommends upgrading to Advantech WebAccess version 8.1, which addresses all the vulnerabilities identified in the advisory. It also recommends implementing standard security practices such as minimizing network exposure, isolating control system networks, and using secure remote access methods such as VPNs.

**Exploitability:**

The advisory states that these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by attackers with low skill. No public exploits are known at the time of the advisory.
