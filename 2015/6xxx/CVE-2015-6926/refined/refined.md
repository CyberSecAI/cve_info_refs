The provided content describes a vulnerability in OXID eShop related to OpenID login.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way OXID eSales uses the OpenID attribute exchange extension for user identification. It relies solely on the email parameter provided by the OpenID Identity Provider (IdP), instead of using the `openid.identity` and `openid.claimed_id` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure OpenID implementation:**  OXID eSales trusts the email address provided by the IdP without verifying the user's claimed identity.
- **Lack of proper identity verification:** The system fails to use the correct OpenID parameters (`openid.identity` and `openid.claimed_id`) for authenticating users, allowing for spoofing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **User impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate any user on the system by creating a malicious OpenID IdP that issues tokens with the target user's email address.
- **Unauthorized access:** Once impersonated, the attacker gains access to the victim's account and its associated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious OpenID IdP:** The attacker needs to deploy their own OpenID Identity Provider.
- **Forged email parameter:** The attacker's IdP issues OpenID tokens containing arbitrary email addresses, which allows them to impersonate any user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to set up and control an OpenID Identity Provider.
- Knowledge of the target system's OpenID implementation.
- No interaction with the victim is required.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability was present in older versions of OXID eShop that supported OpenID login.
- OpenID functionality was removed in OXID eShop 4.5.
- A security bulletin was released to inform users about this vulnerability.
