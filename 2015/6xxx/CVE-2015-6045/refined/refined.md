Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles the layout of table cells when the CSS `empty-cells` property is used. Specifically, it involves improper memory management related to CElement-derived objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. A `CElement`-derived object in memory is freed, but the browser attempts to access or reuse it after it has been deallocated. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control over the affected system.
- **System Compromise:**  An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Files:** An attacker can embed the exploit within a malicious file that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:**  Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content (e.g., advertisements)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file. This typically involves social engineering techniques like phishing emails or instant messages with malicious links or attachments.
