Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6039:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft SharePoint does not properly enforce permission levels when the Office Marketplace injects JavaScript code onto a SharePoint page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Security feature bypass, allowing for persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a SharePoint page. This script would run in the security context of the logged-on user.
- This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information, including authentication cookies and recently submitted data.
- The attacker could also use the injected script to perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must have the ability to update the Marketplace instance.
- The attacker adds malicious code to the Marketplace app.
- The malicious app is pushed to the consuming SharePoint instances.
- The injected script will enable the attacker to update code without requiring SharePoint farm/instance-level permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have permissions to update the Office Marketplace instance.
- Specifically, the attacker must be able to manage web site and create subsites on SharePoint. This is typically granted to users with Full Control permission or who are members of the Site Owners group.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is publicly disclosed.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploits at the time the bulletin was released.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying SharePoint farm/instance code to enforce the appropriate permission level for applications and users.
