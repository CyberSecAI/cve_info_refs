Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory within Internet Explorer. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is the corruption of memory due to incorrect handling of objects by the scripting engines.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** This vulnerability can be exploited for remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user.
*   **System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website. This could involve tricking users into clicking malicious links through emails or instant messages.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/advertisements.
*   **ActiveX Controls:** An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" into an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a specially crafted web page.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage, open a malicious attachment, or interact with a malicious ActiveX control.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to create a working exploit for the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
*   The provided document includes mitigation steps to restrict access to the vbscript.dll and jscript.dll files.
* The document also mentions that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited prior to this bulletin release.
