Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the failure of the `/ajax.php` script in Cerb to properly verify the source of incoming HTTP requests. This lack of verification allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (CWE-352):** The core issue is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability, where an attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on the web application. This is due to the application not validating the origin of requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to a variety of unauthorized actions being performed by a logged-in victim, such as adding administrative accounts to the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By adding new administrator accounts, an attacker can gain full control over the Cerb application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker creates a malicious web page containing a crafted form that targets the vulnerable `/ajax.php` script.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in Cerb user (typically an administrator) to visit this malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious page.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in Cerb user to visit the malicious page, but it can be automated by using techniques like sending an email to a victim.
- **No Direct Access:** The attacker does not require direct access to the Cerb server itself, only the ability to send HTTP requests to it via the victim's browser.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code shows a crafted HTML form that automatically submits to the `/ajax.php` endpoint. This form includes hidden fields to configure user creation parameters such as:
- `c` : config
- `a`: handleSectionAction
- `section`: workers
- `action`: saveWorkerPeek
- `is_superuser`: 1 (setting a user to superuser, i.e., admin)
-  `password_new` and `password_verify`: To set the password of the new user.

The exploit uses JavaScript to automatically submit this form when a victim views the malicious web page.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- **Vendor Advisory:** The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- **Vendor Patch:** Cerb version 7.0.4 includes a fix.
- **Mitigation:** Cerb implemented the Synchronizer Pattern, using session-based tokens included in HTML forms and AJAX requests to verify the requests origin.
