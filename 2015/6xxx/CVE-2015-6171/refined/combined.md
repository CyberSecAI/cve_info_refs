## Security Update for Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers to Address Elevation of Privilege (3119075)

Published: December 8, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to a target system and runs a specially crafted application.

This security update is rated Important for supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel and Windows font drivers handle objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3119075](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3119075).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

[1]This update is only available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

[2]Windows 10 updates are cumulative. In addition to containing non-security updates, they also contain all of the security fixes for all of the Windows 10-affected vulnerabilities shipping with the monthly security release. The update is available via the [Windows Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/home.aspx).

Note Windows Server Technical Preview 3 and Windows Server Technical Preview 4 are affected. Customers running these operating systems are encouraged to apply the update, which is available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

\*The Updates Replaced column shows only the latest update in any chain of superseded updates. For a comprehensive list of updates replaced, go to the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/home.aspx), search for the update KB number, and then view update details (updates replaced information is provided on the Package Details tab).

## Update FAQ

**Why is the update listed in this bulletin also denoted in another bulletin releasing this month?**

The update listed in this bulletin is also denoted in another bulletin releasing this month due to the way fixes for vulnerabilities affecting particular products are consolidated. Since bulletins are broken out by the vulnerabilities being addressed, not by the update package being released, it is possible for separate bulletins, each addressing distinctly different vulnerabilities, to list the same update package as the vehicle for providing their respective fixes. This is frequently the case with cumulative updates for products such as Internet Explorer or Silverlight where singular security updates address very different security vulnerabilities that are being discussed in separate bulletins.

Note that identical update files shipping with multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

Does this update contain any additional security-related changes to functionality?
In addition to the changes that are listed for the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin, this update includes defense-in-depth updates to help improve security-related features.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Kernel Memory Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
