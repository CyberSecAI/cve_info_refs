- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the Windows kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would first need to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system and execute code.
