Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of weak default credentials for several accounts on WAGO IO PLC devices. Specifically, the devices are shipped with easily guessable credentials like `admin:wago`, `user:user`, and `guest:guest`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Credential Management:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of weak, default credentials for administrative and user accounts.
*   **Lack of Forced Password Change:** The system does not force a password change upon the first use or at any later point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** Attackers can use the default credentials to gain unauthorized administrative access to the affected WAGO IO PLC devices.
*   **Full Device Control:** With administrative access, attackers can control the device without restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network-based, as the attacker connects to the device's web interface or FTP server to attempt login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WAGO IO PLC devices.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default credentials for the specific device model.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WAGO IO PLC models 750-849, 750-881, and 758-870, with slight variations in default accounts between models.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication using the default credentials, gaining unrestricted access to the device.
