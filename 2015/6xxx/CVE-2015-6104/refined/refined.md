Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6104:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly references "CVE-2015-6104" and describes a vulnerability related to Windows graphics and font handling, which aligns with the CVE description placeholder.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a **pool-based buffer overflow** that occurs within the `win32k.sys` driver, specifically during the processing of malformed TrueType (TTF) font files. 
   - The root cause lies within how the Adobe Type Manager Library in Windows handles embedded fonts, leading to a write operation beyond the bounds of allocated memory when specific TTF glyph programs are processed.
    - Specifically mentioned functions where crashes occur: `win32k!or_all_4_wide_rotated_need_last`, `win32k!or_all_N_wide_rotated_need_last`, `win32k!or_all_N_wide_rotated_no_last`, or `win32k!or_all_N_wide_unrotated`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow where the `win32k.sys` driver writes data beyond the allocated pool memory while processing TrueType font glyphs.
   - **Improper Font Handling:** The Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts, failing to validate the size or content of the data being processed by the above mentioned functions, leading to memory corruption.
   - **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate TTF font data, particularly within the glyph programs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
   - **Full System Control:** An attacker can then install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
   - **System Instability/Crash:** In some cases, the vulnerability leads to system crashes due to pool corruption, even if code execution is not achieved.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **Specially crafted document:**  An attacker can entice a user to open a specially crafted document containing malicious embedded fonts.
    - **Untrusted Webpage:** An attacker can host a webpage with embedded malicious fonts that can trigger the vulnerability upon visit.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a document or visit a webpage containing the malicious font.
   - **Crafted TTF Font:**  The attacker needs to create a specially crafted TTF font that triggers the vulnerable code path within the `win32k.sys` driver.
   - **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system initially, just user level access to trigger a vulnerable code path.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The provided crash logs confirm that the vulnerability occurs within the `win32k.sys` driver during font rendering.
- The crash often occurs during the `EngTextOut` function or functions called by it.
- The overflow is triggered while trying to display the glyphs of the malformed TTF font rather than during the font loading process.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by a Microsoft Security Update (MS15-115) which corrects how the Adobe Type Manager Library handles embedded fonts.

**Exploit Availability:**

- Proof-of-concept TTF files were created and publicly available for testing and analysis.
