The content is related to CVE-2015-6454.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Two separate instances of pointer dereference vulnerabilities in the Everest Software LLC PeakHMI application. These occur when a specially crafted packet is received by the video server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted Pointer Dereference (CWE-822). The application dereferences a pointer provided in a crafted packet without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities can remotely crash the PeakHMI service if the video server is enabled. This could disrupt the functionality of the HMI system and potentially impact industrial control processes.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by sending crafted network packets to the video server on port 49454.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the PeakHMI server and have a low level of skill to exploit the vulnerability. The video server must be enabled.
