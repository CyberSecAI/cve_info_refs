Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Moxa OnCell Central Manager software contains a hard-coded root account with full privilege access and also has a vulnerable servlet which allows for bypassing the authentication mechanism. The specific flaw lies within the `login()` function of the `RequestController` class which uses hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The software has a hard-coded root account.
*   **CWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues:** A vulnerable servlet allows bypassing the authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can bypass authentication.
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution with full control of the product and potentially on all managed hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the Moxa OnCell Central Manager server.
*   No special privileges or authentication is needed initially due to the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) after a lack of response from the vendor.
* A patch was eventually released by Moxa in version 2.2 of the OnCell Central Manager software.
* The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2015-6481, and it has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.3.
* The vulnerability also allows for remote code execution.
