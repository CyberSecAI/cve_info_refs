Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6576

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of arbitrary user input within a resource in Atlassian Bamboo.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted deserialization of user-provided data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
- Lack of input validation on deserialized data, enabling the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server hosting the vulnerable Bamboo instance. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the Bamboo Web Interface is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker must be able to send malicious serialized data to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Bamboo web interface.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned as a requirement, implying that merely having access to the vulnerable endpoint might be sufficient.

**Affected Versions:**
- Bamboo versions 2.2 and later before 5.8.5
- Bamboo versions 5.9.0 and later before 5.9.7

**Fixed Versions:**
- Bamboo 5.8.5
- Bamboo 5.9.7

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical" by Atlassian.
- Atlassian Cloud instances were automatically updated.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Kaiser of Code White.
- The issue is tracked as BAM-16439 in Atlassian's Jira system.
