Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6015:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from both `www.oracle.com` and `www.kb.cert.org` directly references `CVE-2015-6015` and provides detailed information about it, confirming its relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in a stack-based buffer overflow within the Oracle Outside In Technology library when processing Paradox DB files.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable application using the Outside In library. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the system or application processing the file.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user or application to process a specially crafted Paradox DB file.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious Paradox DB file to a system using the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology library. No authentication is required, so the attacker can be remote and does not need credentials.
   - **Affected Products:**
      - Oracle Outside In Technology versions 8.5.0, 8.5.1, 8.5.2
      - Various third party products which use the vulnerable Outside In library, including (but not limited to): Microsoft Exchange, Google Search Appliance, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, and Novell Groupwise.

**3. Additional Details from the Content:**

   - The CERT advisory provides a concise overview of the vulnerability, including the affected file types (WK4, DOC, and Paradox DB) and the affected Oracle Outside In versions.
   - The Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory confirms this vulnerability and the products impacted, also referencing a fix in the January 2016 CPU. It also notes that the CVSS base score for this vulnerability when network protocols are involved is 6.8.
   - It indicates that the risk may be reduced by blocking network protocols or removing the privileges.
   - The CERT advisory also lists numerous vendors whose products use the vulnerable Outside In library, highlighting the widespread potential impact of this vulnerability.

**4. Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in Oracle Outside In Technology that can be exploited remotely by providing a crafted Paradox DB file to a vulnerable system. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application using the library, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system. Multiple vendors are affected due to widespread use of the library.
