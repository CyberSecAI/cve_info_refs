Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6665:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Drupal handles the `Drupal.ajax()` function when invoked on a whitelisted HTML element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser when they interact with a vulnerable Drupal site. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Phishing attacks
    - Other malicious actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to invoke `Drupal.ajax()` on a whitelisted HTML element. This could potentially be achieved by crafting malicious links or by injecting malicious code within other parts of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to somehow trigger the execution of `Drupal.ajax()` on the vulnerable element in the victim's browser. This could be done remotely via crafted links or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow code injection on the Drupal site.
