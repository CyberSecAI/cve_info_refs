Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6098:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure in Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) to properly validate the length of a buffer before copying memory into it. Specifically, the issue lies within the `ndis!ndisNsiGetIfNameForIfIndex` function and its handling of the IOCTL 0x170034.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Pool buffer overflow:** Due to the lack of proper length validation, a specially crafted input can cause a buffer overflow in the kernel pool.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the targeted system. This means an attacker can execute code with kernel level access.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service by crashing the system due to a bad pool header if not triggered correctly, effectively rendering the machine unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required, since an attacker needs to log on to the system.
- A specially crafted application needs to be run. This application sends a specific IOCTL to the vulnerable driver to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account and be able to log on to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a custom-crafted application that interacts with NDIS.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `ndis.sys` driver.
- The vulnerability is addressed by security update KB3101722, which corrects how NDIS validates buffer lengths.
- The vulnerability was discovered through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- The vulnerability affects Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof of concept (PoC) that crashes Windows 7 32-bit.
