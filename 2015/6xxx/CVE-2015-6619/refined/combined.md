# Nexus Security Bulletin - December 2015

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published December 07, 2015 | Updated March 7, 2016*

We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).
Builds LMY48Z or later and Android 6.0 with Security Patch Level of
December 1, 2015 or later address these issues. Refer to the [Common Questions and Answers](#common_questions_and_answers) section for more details.

Partners were notified about and provided updates for these issues on November
2, 2015 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been released to
the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

## Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
  SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
  installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
  users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
  enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
  Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
  applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
  application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
  attempt to remove any such applications.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
  pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

## Security Vulnerability Details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2015-12-01 patch level.
There is a description of the issue, a severity rationale, and a table
with the CVE, associated bug, severity, updated versions, and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP change that addressed the issue to the
bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP
references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Mediaserver

During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps cannot normally access.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Skia

A vulnerability in the Skia component may be leveraged when processing a
specially crafted media file, that could lead to memory corruption and remote
code execution in a privileged process. This issue is rated as a Critical
severity due to the possibility of remote code execution through multiple
attack methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media
files.

| CVE | Bug(s) with AOSP links | Severity | Updated versions | Date reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2015-6617 | [ANDROID-23648740](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/skia/%2B/a1d8ac0ac0af44d74fc082838936ec265216ab60) | Critical | 6.0 and below | Google internal |

### Elevation of Privilege in Kernel

An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the system kernel could enable a
local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the device root
context. This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of a
local permanent device compromise and the device could only be repaired by
re-flashing the operating system.

| CVE | Bug(s) with AOSP links | Severity | Updated versions | Date reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2015-6619 | [ANDROID-23520714](https://android.googlesource.com/device/htc/flounder-kernel/%2B/25d3e5d71865a7c0324423fad87aaabb70e82ee4) | Critical | 6.0 and below | Jun 7, 2015 |

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Display Driver

There are vulnerabilities in the display drivers that, when processing a media
file, could cause memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution in
the context of the user mode driver loaded by mediaserver. This issue is rated
as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote code execution through
multiple attack methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing
media files.

| CVE | Bug(s) with AOSP links | Severity | Updated versions | Date reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2015-6633 | ANDROID-23987307\* | Critical | 6.0 and below | Google Internal |

\*The patch for this issue is not in AOSP. The update is contained in the
latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Bluetooth

A vulnerability in Android's Bluetooth component could allow remote code
execution. However multiple manual steps are required before this could occur.
In order to do this it would require a successfully paired device, after the
personal area network (PAN) profile is enabled (for example using Bluetooth
Tethering) and the device is paired. The remote code execution would be at the
privilege of the Bluetooth service. A device is only vulnerable to this issue
