Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Semantic Forms extension of MediaWiki. Specifically, multiple reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities were present due to insufficient escaping of parameters in Special:CreateForm and Special:FormEdit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected XSS:** The extension failed to properly sanitize user-provided parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.
  - Vulnerable parameters include `section_foo`, `target`, `alt_form`, `template_foo`, `label_foo`, and `new_template` in `Special:CreateForm` and `Special:FormEdit`.
- **Stored XSS:** The extension also had stored XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, a template label created via Special:CreateTemplate could store malicious code, which is later executed when the template is used with Special:FormEdit. Also, the `wpSummary` parameter of `Special:FormEdit` was vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they view or interact with a vulnerable page or component.
- **Session Hijacking:** Exploitation can lead to session hijacking if the attacker injects malicious code to steal session cookies or other sensitive information, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
- **Defacement:** Malicious scripts could alter the content of the page, defacing it and potentially spreading misinformation.
- **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially steal user data from the page and transmit it to a remote server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URLs:**  An attacker can create specially crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads embedded in vulnerable parameters, which, when clicked by a victim, would execute the malicious script.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers can leverage social engineering to trick victims into clicking on malicious links.
- **Stored Input:** An attacker can use `Special:CreateTemplate` to create a malicious template, which injects XSS on the `Special:FormEdit` page when the template is included on a form. Additionally, using `Special:FormEdit`, an attacker could inject XSS by using the `wpSummary` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to be physically close to the target and can perform the attack remotely via the internet.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to have an understanding of the vulnerable parameters used by the Semantic Forms extension.
- **Ability to Create Malicious Links/Input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious links or input (like malicious templates) containing JavaScript code.
