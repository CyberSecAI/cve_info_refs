Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office software, specifically Excel, handles objects in memory when processing binary Excel files (.xlsb).
- A malformed .xlsb file can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. This is a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is the use-after-free vulnerability, where a memory location is accessed after it has been deallocated. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The vulnerability stems from improper memory management within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The code execution happens in the context of the current user, meaning if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains those privileges.
- **Full System Control:** With administrative rights, the attacker can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker can send a specially crafted .xlsb file to the victim via email and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based Attack Scenario:** An attacker can host a malicious website or compromise an existing site to host a specially crafted .xlsb file. The victim would need to visit the website and then be convinced to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a malformed .xlsb file:** The attacker needs the technical skills to create an Excel file that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to open the malicious file, whether it's through email or by luring them to a website.
- **No specific access needed:** The attacker does not require prior access to the target system.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft Office, including Office 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016, along with related software like Excel Viewer and Office Compatibility Pack.
- Microsoft released a security update to address this issue by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the coordinated release by Microsoft and the reporting party.
