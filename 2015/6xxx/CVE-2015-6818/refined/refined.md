Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6818:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The provided content from `ffmpeg.org` and `lists.debian.org` explicitly mentions **CVE-2015-6818** and provides details about the vulnerability. The ubuntu page also lists the CVE as related to a libav vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of enforcement regarding the uniqueness of the IHDR (Image Header) chunk within a PNG image file, specifically in the function `decode_ihdr_chunk` in `libavcodec/pngdec.c`. This allows a maliciously crafted PNG file to contain multiple IHDR chunks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The decoder did not check for and prevent multiple IHDR chunks within a PNG file.
*   **Out-of-bounds Array Access:** The decoder attempts to process these multiple chunks, leading to an out-of-bounds array access, which can result in a crash or other unspecified issues.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a crafted PNG file with multiple IHDR chunks. This can lead to a crash of the application attempting to decode the image.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** The descriptions mention a "possibly have unspecified other impact", which indicates that the vulnerability could potentially be exploited for other forms of attack such as arbitrary code execution, although not definitively confirmed from the information at hand.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a user being tricked into opening a maliciously crafted PNG file.
*   The attacker would need to create a specially crafted PNG file containing more than one IHDR chunk.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted PNG file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into opening the specially crafted file.
*   No specific position in the network is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix is to enforce uniqueness of the IHDR chunk, preventing multiple chunks from being processed.
*   The Debian LTS advisory notes that this issue is addressed in libav version `6:11.12-1~deb8u2` and recommends upgrading the libav packages.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice states that by updating the affected packages (`libavformat53`, `libavcodec53`) to version `4:0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2` and higher, the vulnerability is resolved.
*   The fix to this issue was implemented by only allowing one IHDR chunk. Multiple IHDR chunks are forbidden in PNG.
*  The description in lists.debian.org provides a greater level of technical detail into the nature of this vulnerability than the placeholder description.

In summary, CVE-2015-6818 describes an out-of-bounds array access vulnerability caused by a lack of input validation when processing IHDR chunks in PNG files. Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, and potentially to arbitrary code execution on vulnerable systems.
