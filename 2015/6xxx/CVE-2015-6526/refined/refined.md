Based on the information provided, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6526:

*   **Vulnerability:** The Linux kernel's perf subsystem on PowerPC 64-bit architectures did not properly bound callchain backtraces, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, the `perf_callchain_user_64` function could enter an infinite loop when processing a specially crafted stack layout.
*   **Root Cause:** Missing stack depth limit for 64-bit userspace backtraces in the perf subsystem on PowerPC. The code capped 32-bit backtraces but not 64-bit ones.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local, unprivileged user can create a special stack layout.
*   **Impact:** Local denial of service (CPU exhaustion). The affected CPU core becomes tied up in an infinite loop, rendering it unusable and potentially impacting overall system performance. The process cannot be killed, requiring a reboot to resolve the issue.
*   **Affected Systems:** PowerPC64 kernels that support perf. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is listed as affected in one of the bugzilla entries. Ubuntu 12.04 is also affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Apply the patch that caps the maximum user-level stacktrace collected by perf to `PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH` on 64-bit PowerPC architectures. This patch limits the number of stack frames that `perf_callchain_user_64` will process, preventing the infinite loop.

The patch commit message and the Ubuntu USN entry provide similar information. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and its impact. The key aspect is the unbounded callchain backtrace, which the fix addresses by introducing a limit.
