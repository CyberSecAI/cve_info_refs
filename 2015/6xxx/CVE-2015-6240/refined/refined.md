Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a symlink vulnerability present in Ansible's chroot, jail, and zone connection plugins. When transferring files to these restricted environments, the file copying was performed outside the restricted environment, relying on prepending a path prefix. This did not account for symbolic links present inside the restricted environment, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths and escape the restricted context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink vulnerability:** The core weakness was that file transfers were not executed from within the chroot, jail, or zone. Instead, the ansible control process outside the restricted environment performed the file copy using paths that were modified by simply prepending a string, making it susceptible to symlink attacks. An attacker could create a symbolic link inside the restricted environment to point outside it, and then a file transfer operation would write data to the target outside of the restricted environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Restricted environment escape:** A local user with control over a chroot, jail, or zone managed by Ansible could escape the restricted environment and gain access to the managing host's filesystem.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By using symlinks, an attacker could write files to arbitrary locations on the managing host.
- **Potential for privilege escalation:** An attacker could potentially escalate their privileges if they could write to privileged locations via the symlink vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires a user to have local access to a chroot, jail, or zone managed by Ansible.
- **Symlink creation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link within the restricted environment.
- **File transfer:** The attacker exploits the file transfer functionality (put_file) in Ansible to copy files to the path indicated by their symlink, thus escaping the restricted environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over restricted environment:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create files and symlinks within the chroot, jail, or zone managed by Ansible.
- **Ansible execution:** The attacker does not directly control the execution of Ansible, but depends on the Ansible administrator using file transfer capabilities with the vulnerable connection plugins.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Ansible version 1.9.2.
- The fix involved ensuring file copying was performed from within the restricted environments using `dd` command inside the jail/zone instead of `shutil.copyfile` from the host.
- The commits that directly addressed the symlink issue are:
    - `952166f48eb0f5797b75b160fd156bbe1e8fc647` (for chroot)
    - `ca2f2c4ebd7b5e097eab0a710f79c1f63badf95b` (for jail/zone)
- Other commits, such as `548a7288a90c49e9b50ccf197da307eae525b899` and `270be6a6f5852c5563976f060c80eff64decc89c` were related to performance improvements and fixing command execution issues which are not directly related to this specific vulnerability.
