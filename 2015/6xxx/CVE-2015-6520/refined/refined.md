{
  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2015-6520",
    "Description": "The ippusbxd daemon in cups-filters before 1.22 listens on all network interfaces, allowing remote attackers to print to a locally-connected printer.",
    "Root cause": "The ippusbxd daemon was binding to the IPv6 wildcard address (in6addr_any) instead of the loopback address (in6addr_loopback), which resulted in the service listening on all available network interfaces.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect network socket binding",
      "Lack of proper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to a printer connected via USB to a vulnerable machine running the ippusbxd daemon. This access allows for remote printing and potentially accessing the printer's web configuration interface.",
     "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can connect to the exposed port through any of the machine's network interfaces.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable machine or have network access to it."
