Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-6729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's `thumb.php` script failing to properly sanitize error messages. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code via user-controlled parameters within the error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because error messages are generated based on user-supplied input without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to malicious actions on the user's browser such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting to malicious sites, or other browser-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a URL that triggers an error in `thumb.php`. The crafted error message will contain malicious JavaScript which will then be executed within the victim's browser when the error is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the parameters passed to the `thumb.php` script. This could be through crafting malicious links that the victim clicks, or by exploiting another vulnerability in the application.
*   The attacker has to be an external actor.
