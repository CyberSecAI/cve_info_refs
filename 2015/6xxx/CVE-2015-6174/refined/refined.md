- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would first need to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to the target system and be able to execute code on the system.
