Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6407:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the web framework of Cisco Emergency Responder (CER). It allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to a restricted location on the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The core issue is the ability to upload files without proper validation or restriction.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The advisory mentions CWE-20, indicating that the system fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input (in this case, uploaded files).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload arbitrary files to a restricted location on the filesystem.
- While the advisory doesn't specify the exact consequences of arbitrary file upload, it generally means the attacker can:
    - Potentially overwrite existing files.
    - Introduce malicious code or scripts to be executed on the server.
    - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - Disrupt the normal operation of the system.
    - Deface the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The advisory specifies the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Cisco Emergency Responder system over the network.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a request with malicious file content to be uploaded.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) indicates:
    - Network access vector (AV:N)
    - Low attack complexity (AC:L)
    - Single authentication is required (Au:S), this is incorrect based on the advisory description, it should be AU:N.
    - No confidentiality impact (C:N)
    - Partial integrity impact (I:P)
    - No availability impact (A:N)
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Emergency Responder Release 10.5(3.10000.9).
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability and users are advised to upgrade to the fixed version.
- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploits or malicious use.
