# [Security vulnerabilities in RT](/blog/2015/08/security-vulnerabilities-in-rt)

[August 12, 2015](/blog/2015/08/security-vulnerabilities-in-rt)

[Shawn Moore](/blog?author=56b4ec420c4a68f5ea9258bb)

We have discovered security vulnerabilities which affect both RT 4.0.x and RT 4.2.x.  We are releasing RT versions [4.0.24](https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/download.html?file=/rt/release/rt-4.0.24.tar.gz) and [4.2.12](https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/download.html?file=/rt/release/rt-4.2.12.tar.gz) to resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all released versions of 4.0 and 4.2.

The vulnerabilities addressed by 4.0.24, 4.2.12, and the below patches include the following:

RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the user and group rights management pages.  This vulnerability is assigned [CVE-2015-5475](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5475).  It was discovered and reported by Marcin Kopeć at Data Reliance Shared Service Center.

RT 4.2.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the cryptography interface.  This vulnerability could allow an attacker with a carefully-crafted key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected.

[Patches for all releases of 4.0.x and 4.2.x](https://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/security-2015-08-12.tar.gz) are available ([signature](https://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/security-2015-08-12.tar.gz.asc)). Versions of RT older than 4.0.0 are unsupported and do not receive security patches; please contact sales@bestpractical.com if you
need assistance with an older RT version.

The README in the tarball contains instructions for applying the patches.  If you need help resolving this issue locally, we will provide discounted pricing for single-incident support; please contact us at sales@bestpractical.com for more information.

Escape message crypt status as we insert it into the DOM

```
The ->{'Value'} part of each message is inserted into the DOM with no
escaping (to accommodate MakeClicky and callbacks using HTML). Values RT
receives from other systems must be escaped or they leave us vulnerable to
an XSS injection attack.

This also happens to fix a bug where email addresses of senders would in
some cases not be shown in the browser.

Package        : request-tracker4
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5475

It was discovered that Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket
tracking system is susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack via the
user an group rights management pages (CVE-2015-5475) and via the
cryptography interface, allowing an attacker with a carefully-crafted
key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which
use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-5+deb7u4. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by CVE-2015-5475.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
