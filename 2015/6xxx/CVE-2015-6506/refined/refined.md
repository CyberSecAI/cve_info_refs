Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-6506:

**CVE-2015-6506:**

*   **Status:** UNRELATED. None of the provided documents mention CVE-2015-6506. However, the content discusses two related vulnerabilities with the CVE IDs CVE-2015-5475, and one without a CVE ID that was fixed in the same releases. The following analysis is based on the XSS vulnerabilities described in the content.

**Vulnerability 1 (CVE-2015-5475):**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The user and group rights management pages in RT are vulnerable to XSS.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious Javascript into the user and group rights management pages.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the user and group rights management pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to find a way to insert malicious script into user and group right management pages that would be executed by the browsers of other users.

**Vulnerability 2 (No CVE ID):**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the cryptography interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The cryptography interface in RT is vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with a carefully crafted key can inject Javascript into RT's user interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the cryptography interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need the ability to create and use a malicious cryptographic key within RT.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The second XSS vulnerability specifically affects installations that use GnuPG or S/MIME. Installations that do not use either are not affected.
*   Patches and new releases (4.0.24 and 4.2.12) were released to address both vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities affect RT versions 4.0.0 and above, and 4.2.0 and above, respectively.
*   The github commit 36a4619 addresses an issue where unescaped data from RT was being inserted into the DOM leading to an XSS vulnerability. The commit message also notes that this also fixed a bug where email addresses of senders would not always be shown in the browser. This is likely related to the second XSS vulnerability.
