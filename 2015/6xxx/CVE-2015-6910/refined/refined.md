Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-6910:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Command Injection:** Improper handling of the `subtitle_codepage` parameter in the `subtitle.cgi` script allows for the execution of arbitrary system commands.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Vulnerabilities in the `watchstatus.cgi` and `audiotrack.cgi` scripts allow for the execution of arbitrary SQL statements due to improper handling of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `subtitle_codepage` in `subtitle.cgi`
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization/validation allows for command injection.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `id` in both `watchstatus.cgi` and `audiotrack.cgi`.
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization/validation allows for SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   Arbitrary system command execution with `root` privileges.
    *   Full compromise of the Synology DiskStation NAS, including all stored data.
    *   Potential use of the compromised NAS as a stepping stone to attack other systems.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Arbitrary SQL statement execution with DBA privileges.
    *   Compromise of the PostgreSQL database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `subtitle.cgi` with a crafted `subtitle_codepage` parameter.
    *   Vulnerable when 'public share' option is enabled, allowing unauthenticated remote exploitation.
*  **SQL Injection**
    * HTTP POST requests to vulnerable cgi scripts, with crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   Network access to the Synology NAS.
    *   If 'public share' is enabled, no authentication is required.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Network access to the Synology NAS.
    *   For `watchstatus.cgi`, a valid `X-SYNO-TOKEN` header might be required (though this can be obtained).

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory from Securify provides detailed proof-of-concept exploit examples for each vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities were found in Synology Video Station versions up to and including 1.5-0757.
*   Synology released patches to address these issues, specifically in Video Station versions 1.5-0757 for `audiotrack.cgi` and 1.5-0763 for `watchstatus.cgi` and `subtitle.cgi`.
