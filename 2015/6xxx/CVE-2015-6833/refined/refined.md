```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of relative paths within zip archives by the phar extension when extracting files. This allows an attacker to craft a zip archive containing relative paths (e.g., "../somefile.ext"), enabling files to be placed outside the intended destination directory during extraction.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper validation of relative paths in zip archives during file extraction.
    - The phar extension does not adequately sanitize file paths in zip archives before extraction, thus it is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could overwrite files outside of the intended destination directory, potentially causing various impacts depending on the files overwritten.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted zip archive containing relative paths that is processed by PHP's phar extension during extraction.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious zip archive to be processed by a vulnerable version of PHP.
