Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the "WP Limit Login Attempts" WordPress plugin. The plugin uses user-supplied HTTP headers (`HTTP_CLIENT_IP` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`) to determine the user's IP address, which is then directly embedded into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin directly incorporates untrusted data from HTTP headers into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Manipulation: By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker could potentially manipulate the database. This could include reading sensitive data, modifying existing records, inserting new records, or deleting data.
- Data Breach: An attacker might gain access to sensitive information stored in the WordPress database.
- Complete Compromise: In a worst-case scenario, a successful SQL injection attack could lead to full control of the WordPress site, potentially enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Headers: The attack vector is through manipulated HTTP headers, specifically the `HTTP_CLIENT_IP` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` headers. By modifying these headers, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Send HTTP Requests: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, including the ability to modify HTTP headers.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring user authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:

```php
 function getip(){
           if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
        } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
        } else {
            $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
             if($ip=='::1'){
                 $ip = '127.0.0.1';
             }
        }
        return $ip;
    }

    $ip = getip();
    $tablename = $wpdb->prefix."limit_login";
    $tablerows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT `login_id`, `login_ip`,`login_attempts`,`attempt_time`,`locked_time` FROM  `$tablename` WHERE `login_ip` =  '$ip'  ORDER BY `login_id` DESC LIMIT 1 " );
```

The `getip()` function retrieves the IP address from the HTTP headers, and that IP is then directly inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization. This creates the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Scott Arciszewski on the oss-security mailing list.
- The plugin author addressed the vulnerability in a new version of the plugin.
- The WordPress security team advises reporting vulnerabilities via email instead of public forums to ensure timely patching and to prevent exploitation by malicious actors before fixes are available.
