Subject: Some Wordpress Plugin Stuff

Hi OSS Sec,

I took a quick glance through some Wordpress plugins tagged with security.
I don't imagine anyone would be surprised that I found vulnerabilities.

-------------------------------

SecurityMoz Security Audit

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/securemoz-security-audit/>

file_get_contents() + explicitly HTTP (no TLS) -> unserialize()

-------------------------------

WP Limit Login Attempts

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-limit-login-attempts/>

Trivial SQL injection via HTTP headers.

     $ip = getip();
     $tablename = $wpdb->prefix."limit_login";
     $tablerows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT `login_id`,
`login_ip`,`login_attempts`,`attempt_time`,`locked_time` FROM  `$tablename`
  WHERE `login_ip` =  '$ip'  ORDER BY `login_id` DESC LIMIT 1 " );

     // ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~

    function getip(){
           if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
        } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
        } else {
            $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
             if($ip=='::1'){
                 $ip = '127.0.0.1';
             }
        }
        return $ip;
    }

-------------------------------

I'm not sure if it's even worth assigning a CVE to any of these. Maybe the
SQLi one? I leave that decision in MITRE's capable hands.

Also, Tor Blocker (link below) uses HTTP to grab the list of IP addresses
to block. It's telling and appropriate that the person who developed a
plugin to oppose a privacy technology would fail to use TLS.

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/tor-exit-nodes-blocker/>

(Surely no one would ever think to hack an upstream router and MitM the
connection to block the blog administrator from their own blog or allow Tor
nodes through!)

That's all from me. I might keep poking at some of the fatter plugins to
see what I can find.

We don't think that we can assign a CVE ID for this. The product
relies on data at the <http://pike.hqpeak.com/api/free.php> URL; that
data is not currently available at the
<https://pike.hqpeak.com/api/free.php> URL or any other HTTPS URL that
we know about. Apparently the risk in using HTTP is
incorrect/incomplete data, not code execution. If MITM attacks occur,
the product user could typically recover from them by deleting
unwanted postings and by establishing their own administrative login
from a different IP address. MITM attacks aren't likely to occur
continuously. Given that the data is only available via HTTP (not
HTTPS) and the product user wants the data, we're unable to reach a
conclusion that the <http://pike.hqpeak.com> URL is necessarily a
vulnerability without knowing the vendor's perspective. One possible
example is that the vendor didn't want to support HTTPS in case the
plugin became very popular and the pike.hqpeak.com server was unable
to support all of the load of cryptography calculations.

# SQL Injection Vulnerability

  So, you have this query here:

  ```
  $tablerows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT <code>login_id</code>, <code>login_ip</code>,<code>login_attempts</code>,<code>attempt_time</code>,<code>locked_time</code> FROM  <code>$tablename</code>   WHERE <code>login_ip</code> =  '$ip'  ORDER BY <code>login_id</code> DESC LIMIT 1 " );
  ```

  The variable $ip is populated by this function

  ```
  function getip(){
                     if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {
                      $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
                  } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
                      $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
                  } else {
                      $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
                       if($ip=='::1'){
                           $ip = '127.0.0.1';
                       }
                  }
                  return $ip;
              }
  ```

  So if someone sends an X-Forwarded-For HTTP header with a malicious SQL injection payload, they could overwrite your query and hack your database.

  While we appreciate you informing plugin developers of this, we ask you not publicly disclose security issues like this in the public venue of the forums for a couple reasons.

  1) We can’t actually promise that anyone will notice it in a reasonable time.

  2) Not all developers are responsible and monitor the forums regularly.

  3) Public disclosure runs a higher risk of the hack being let loose in the wild before the developer has a reasonable chance to validate and patch the issue.

  Because of that, we ask you contact the plugin review team at plugins@wordpress.org – If you chose to publicly release on your own site, we’re not about to try and stop you. At the same time, we have the ability to email developers directly and, if needed, patch their plugin for them. So you will actually get a faster result than you would posting here and hoping someone notices promptly.

  From <https://wordpress.org/about/security/>

  > When a plugin vulnerability is discovered by the WordPress Security Team, they contact the plugin author and work together to fix and release a secure version of the plugin. If there is a lack of response from the plugin author or if the vulnerability is severe, the plugin/theme is pulled from the public directory, and in some cases, fixed and updated directly by the Security Team.

  We understand the concept of ‘my bug, I decide how to report it’ but in this case, it’s not going to get things patched faster.

  Please review our documentation on how to report security issues with WP (and plugins): <https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#where-do-i-report-security-issues>

  We prioritize ALL security reports above everything else in plugin land, and we directly contact developers pretty much daily. Furthermore, we take the extra step of giving the plugin a full re-review for any thing else we might have missed, just in case. Obviously it’s not perfect, but we try.

  Please. Email us. We will make SURE the developer gets the memo and it gets addressed. We have the power. Let us wield it for you.

  Okay. I’ll email you 24 hours before public disclosure. My previous coordinated disclosure time table of 30 days was counter-productive, but maybe immediate full disclosure isn’t the right answer.

  Or, maybe give them the time they need to fix the issue before you become the one who releases it to the wild, thus creating the danger you hoped to avoid by identifying the vulnerability in the first place?

  Publicly disclosing a security vulnerability doesn’t make code spontaneously happen, all it does is immediately endanger everyone using it.

  When you publicly disclose a security vulnerability, you aren’t the hero saving the day, you’re the villain who has just put everyone’s site (and sometimes their livelihoods) in the line of fire.

  Please don’t be the villain, be the hero. Disclose responsibly by disclosing privately. 🙂

  Every security expert disagrees.

  I’m afraid that’s not the case, almost all reputable security experts want and advocate responsible disclosure.

  Yes, Bruce Schneier is one of the top experts and among the most knowledgable and experienced. But cherry picking your favorite doesn’t change a simple fact: just finding and spilling the beans without taking into account the result doesn’t help anyone.

  I’m glad that’s something that you do seem to get.

  > Okay. I’ll email you 24 hours before public disclosure. *My previous coordinated disclosure time table of 30 days was counter-productive, but maybe immediate full disclosure isn’t the right answer.*

  Emphasis is mine. 😉 Thank you for trying to disclose responsibly.

  Emphasis: Immediate. I’m still going to disclose publicly.

  Also, can we please 86 the meme that coordinated disclosure is responsible? Full disclosure can be responsible too, as can non-disclosure. Context matters a lot here.

  Right. We get that and all you’re being asked to do is be responsible.

  This was disclosed and I’m 86’ing this topic by closing it.
