  "CVE-2015-6000": {
    "description": "Vtiger CRM version 6.3 and lower are vulnerable to Authenticated Remote Code Execution. Multiple flaws in the Settings_Vtiger_CompanyDetailsSave_Action class allow attackers to upload files with arbitrary file names and (almost) arbitrary contents, including, but not limited to, PHP code passing commands to the underlying operating system.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and sanitization in the file upload functionality.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The file type check is based solely on the MIME type ('Content-Type') sent by the client.",
        "Insufficient check for PHP code inside the uploaded file, which can be circumvented by using PHP short tags instead of '<?php '.",
        "Lack of protection against uploads of code written in scripting languages other than PHP.",
        "The application saves the uploaded file with a client-specified filename in the publicly accessible test/logo directory."
      ],
       "impact": "Remote code execution on the server hosting Vtiger CRM.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP POST request with a file upload to the 'Company Logo' functionality, an attacker can upload arbitrary code (e.g., PHP) to the server.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires valid Vtiger CRM user credentials with administrative privileges to access the CRM Settings page."
