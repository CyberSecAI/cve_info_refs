{
  "CVE-2015-6820": {
    "root cause": "The `ff_sbr_apply` function in `libavcodec/aacsbr.c` did not check for a matching AAC frame syntax element before proceeding with Spectral Band Replication calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Out-of-bounds array access."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (out-of-bounds array access), possibly other unspecified impact",
    "attack vector": "Crafted AAC data",
    "attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker, ability to provide a crafted audio file.",
    "additional notes": "This vulnerability can be triggered by providing specially crafted AAC data to libav library. The vulnerable function `ff_sbr_apply` will attempt to perform Spectral Band Replication calculations without checking the element type, resulting in an out-of-bounds array access, leading to a denial-of-service."
