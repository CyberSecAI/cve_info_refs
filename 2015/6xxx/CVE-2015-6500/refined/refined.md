Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insufficient validation of the `dir` parameter within the `index.php/apps/files/ajax/scan.php` script in ownCloud. This script is responsible for indexing user files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is information exposure through directory listing. By manipulating the `dir` parameter, an attacker can traverse the directory structure of the underlying file system beyond the intended scope of the application.
- **Path Traversal:** The ability to use `../` sequences in the `dir` parameter allows an attacker to access directories outside the user's designated file storage area.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `dir` parameter, allowing arbitrary directory paths to be provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to the file system structure, potentially exposing sensitive file paths, configuration files, and other users' directories.
- **Denial of Service:** By selecting very deep directory structures, an attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service attack by consuming excessive computational resources as the application attempts to index the specified directories.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `scan.php` script.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `dir` parameter in the request to traverse directories outside the user's scope using `../` sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** A standard user account on the ownCloud instance is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ownCloud server.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory indicates the vulnerability affects version 8.1.0 of ownCloud.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-07-24 and a fix was released on 2015-08-11.
- The public disclosure occurred on 2015-08-25 with the release of the ownCloud Security Advisory oc-sa-2015-014.

In summary, CVE-2015-6500 is a path traversal vulnerability in ownCloud that allows an authenticated user to enumerate the file system structure and potentially cause a denial of service.
