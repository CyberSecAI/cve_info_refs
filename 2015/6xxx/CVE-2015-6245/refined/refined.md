Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the GSM RLC/MAC dissector in Wireshark.
- The dissector used incorrect integer data types while processing GSM RLC/MAC packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Data Types:** The use of improper integer types in `epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_rlcmac.c` leads to incorrect calculations or processing of data related to GSM RLC/MAC packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can craft a malicious packet that triggers an infinite loop within the GSM RLC/MAC dissector. This leads to excessive consumption of CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Packet:** The attacker needs to craft a specifically malformed GSM RLC/MAC packet.
- **Network Injection or Trace File:** The attacker can either inject the crafted packet onto a network that Wireshark is monitoring, or convince the victim to open a malicious packet trace file containing such packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely.
- **Packet Injection or Trace File Delivery:** The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic or deliver a crafted packet capture file to a user running Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 1.12.x before 1.12.7.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.12.7
- The vulnerability was discovered by Antti Levom√§ki and Christian Jalio.
