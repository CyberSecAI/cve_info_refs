**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow located in the `AGM.dll` file of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A specially crafted PDF with multiple layers can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. This leads to a heap buffer overflow condition, where data is written beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The code will execute under the context of the current user process. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by the user.
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious PDF file on a website and trick a user into visiting the page. Opening the file through the browser (or downloading and opening) will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
