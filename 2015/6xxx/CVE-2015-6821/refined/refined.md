Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-6821:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly mentions `CVE-2015-6821` and provides context of the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `ff_mpv_common_init` function in `libavcodec/mpegvideo.c` not properly maintaining the encoding context.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of the encoding context.
*   Stale/invalid pointer access due to insufficient initialization/reset in the code

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS) due to an invalid pointer access.
*   Possibly unspecified other impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   Crafted MPEG data is used as input to trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MPEG file as input to the FFmpeg library.

**7. Technical details:**

*   The `ff_mpv_common_init` function's handling of the encoding context was incomplete. Pointers in the function were not being cleared, which resulted in stale pointers.
* The fix for this issue was to add code that clears pointers in ff_mpv_common_init(). This prevents stale pointers from leaking through any execution path.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

* The fix for this vulnerability involves clearing the pointers in the `ff_mpv_common_init()` function to prevent stale pointers.
* The content states "possibly have unspecified other impact" which suggests that the full scope of potential impact might not be completely understood but is not limited to DoS.
