Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw that occurs within the handling of `CTableLayout` objects in Microsoft Internet Explorer. By manipulating document elements, an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after the memory it points to has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition. This happens when a program accesses memory that has already been freed, which can lead to crashes or, more critically, arbitrary code execution.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability results in memory corruption, which can allow an attacker to overwrite memory and take control of the process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This code runs with the privileges of the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, a successful exploit could grant the attacker full control over the system. They could install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability. The victim must visit this malicious page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **Malicious File:** It is also mentioned that the vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious file.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may inject the malicious code into compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerability and how to trigger it through specific document manipulations of `CTableLayout` objects.
