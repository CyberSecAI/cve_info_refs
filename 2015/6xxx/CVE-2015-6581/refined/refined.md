Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6581:

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-6581 is a vulnerability affecting the OpenJPEG library, a JPEG 2000 image compression/decompression library. The vulnerability, along with others (CVE-2015-8871, CVE-2016-1924, and CVE-2016-7163), can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution if a malformed JPEG 2000 file is processed.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to flaws in the way OpenJPEG handles malformed JPEG 2000 files. The specific nature of the flaws is not described in the provided text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper handling of malformed JPEG 2000 files:** This is the core weakness, allowing attackers to trigger vulnerabilities through crafted files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malformed file can cause the application using OpenJPEG to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In more severe cases, exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious JPEG 2000 files:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file to a vulnerable application using OpenJPEG.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG 2000 file to a system processing it with the vulnerable version of OpenJPEG. This might involve:
    *   Uploading the file to a website that processes it.
    *   Sending the file as an email attachment.
    *   Placing the file in a location where it will be processed by an application.

**Additional details:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3665-1) indicates that the issue was fixed in version `2.1.0-2+deb8u1` for the stable distribution (jessie).
*   The advisory also mentions other CVEs fixed in the same update, suggesting multiple vulnerabilities within OpenJPEG.

This analysis is based on the provided content. For a full understanding of the specifics of the vulnerability, further details of the flaws within OpenJPEG would be required.
