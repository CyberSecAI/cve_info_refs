  "CVE-2015-6695": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the value attribute. By setting the value attribute to a specially crafted array an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the 'value' attribute, allowing a dangling pointer to be reused after being freed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious page or file containing a specially crafted array within the 'value' attribute. User interaction is required."
