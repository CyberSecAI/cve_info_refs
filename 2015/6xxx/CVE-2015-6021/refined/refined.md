- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtering of SNMP agent supplied data before it's stored and displayed by the Spiceworks Desktop web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker on the same network segment as the scanned device can execute arbitrary code in a logged-in user's browser session. This can lead to cookie theft and other actions within the application, potentially causing further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker utilizes an SNMP agent to inject malicious code into the `sysDescr` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1) or `sysName` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5) OIDs in response to SNMP GetRequest messages during a network scan.
    - The code injected via `sysDescr` is limited to 50 characters and executes when the user navigates to the inventory page.
    - The code injected via `sysName` is limited to 255 characters, truncated at the first period, and executes both during the network scan and when the user navigates to the inventory page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the scanned device and be able to respond to SNMP GetRequest messages using an SNMP agent. No authentication is required.
