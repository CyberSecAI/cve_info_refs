Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- OpenSSH versions 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set the permissions of TTY (teletypewriter) devices to be world-writable. This means any local user can write to these devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the setting of world-writable permissions on TTY devices by sshd.
- **Race Condition**: The exploit relies on a race condition between the attacker and the sshd process in creating the pty.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Terminal disruption:** Local users can write arbitrary data, including terminal escape sequences to the TTY devices of logged-in users. This can lead to denial of service scenarios by disrupting the terminal.
- **Privilege escalation:** As demonstrated by the provided exploit, this can be leveraged to gain root privileges. By writing specific escape sequences to the TTY device before the SSH session is fully established, the attacker can manipulate the terminal to execute commands as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **TTY manipulation:** Attackers need to be able to write to TTY devices, which is possible because of the incorrect permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable OpenSSH version is running.
- They don't need any special privileges initially.

**More Details:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates a race condition to gain root access by writing shell commands to a TTY device just after it is created by sshd.
- The exploit first creates a child process and then opens the new TTY device created by sshd.
- It then duplicates the file descriptor for the TTY to standard in/out/err.
- The child process uses ioctl with TIOCSCTTY to make the TTY the controlling terminal and then writes the shell command to create a SUID shell.
- The parent process waits for child to complete and then indicates that the SUID shell is created.
- The official CVE description mentions that this could allow a denial of service but doesn't fully cover that it can be used for local priv esc.
- The openssh release notes describe this issue as "OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences."
- The gentoo security advisory for this vulnerability shows that it affects versions of OpenSSH < 7.1_p1-r2
