OpenSSH 7.0 was released on 2015-08-11. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in the next release
including:
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
\* Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
for AES.
\* MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.1 when it is released.
Changes since OpenSSH 6.9
=========================
This focus of this release is primarily to deprecate weak, legacy
and/or unsafe cryptography.
Security
--------
\* sshd(8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-
writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages
to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.
Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.
\* sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could successfully
compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
impersonate other users. Reported by Moritz Jodeit.
\* sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could
compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.
\* sshd(8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request
the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in
a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in sshd(8) and any
authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication
mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.
Potentially-incompatible Changes
--------------------------------
\* Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
default at compile time.
\* Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
\* Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-\* host and user keys is disabled
by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
\* Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
\* The default for the sshd\_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
\* PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
were enabled).
New Features
------------
\* ssh\_config(5): add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes option to control which
public key types are available for user authentication.
\* sshd\_config(5): add HostKeyAlgorithms option to control which
public key types are offered for host authentications.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): extend Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgorithms,
HostKeyAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and HostbasedKeyTypes
options to allow appending to the default set of algorithms
instead of replacing it. Options may now be prefixed with a '+'
to append to the default, e.g. "HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss".
\* sshd\_config(5): PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of
'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-
password'.
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): add compatability workarounds for Cisco and more
PuTTY versions. bz#2424
\* Fix some omissions and errors in the PROTOCOL and PROTOCOL.mux
documentation relating to Unix domain socket forwarding;
bz#2421 bz#2422
\* ssh(1): Improve the ssh(1) manual page to include a better
description of Unix domain socket forwarding; bz#2423
\* ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): skip uninitialised PKCS#11 slots, fixing
failures to load keys when they are present. bz#2427
\* ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): do not ignore PKCS#11 hosted keys that wth
empty CKA\_ID; bz#2429
\* sshd(8): clarify documentation for UseDNS option; bz#2045
Portable OpenSSH
----------------
\* Check realpath(3) behaviour matches what sftp-server requires and
use a replacement if necessary.
Checksums:
==========
- SHA1 (openssh-7.0.tar.gz) = a19ff0bad2a67348b1d01a38a9580236120b7099
- SHA256 (openssh-7.0.tar.gz) = 4F6HV/ZqT465f3sMB2vIkXO+wrYtL5hnqzAymfbZ1Jk=

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to
the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

>> <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0>

>> Attackers who could successfully compromise the pre-authentication
>> process for remote code execution

As far as we know, what this means is that the attacker has the
ability to execute arbitrary code (or, specific unintended pieces of
code) with the uid of the sshd account. During a normal
pre-authentication phase, some code runs with this uid, and other code
runs as root. The phrase "pre-authentication process" is potentially
ambiguous, i.e., it could mean either "the sequence of steps that
occur during the pre-authentication phase" or "the UNIX process that
is intentionally running with the sshd uid."

We don't understand why "for remote code execution" was mentioned. A
case where a local attacker, who has access only to the sshd uid, can
exploit a bug in the monitor component seems completely relevant for
purposes of CVE.

In other words, we think the CVE IDs below apply to two types of
threat models: either there is a security-relevant bug in the code
that runs with the sshd uid, or the attacker happens to have access to
the sshd uid for a reason unrelated to the OpenSSH source code (e.g.,
administrative error). In the former case, there would be a separate
CVE ID for any such bug.

Subject: Re: OpenSSH: CVE-2015-6565 (pty issue in 6.8-6.9) can lead to
	local  privesc on Linux

Hi list,

I know I'm late to the party, but I was bored, so I decided to write
an exploit for CVE-2015-6565 which affects OpenSSH 6.8-6.9
It is mostly considered to be a "DoS", even though Jann Horn publicly
told how it could be exploited for local privilege escalation, but I
guess its either PoC||GTFO for users to update.

 From <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6565>

"sshd in OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 uses world-writable permissions for TTY
devices, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(terminal disruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
writing to a device, as demonstrated by writing an escape sequence."

I think the description should be updated.

$ gcc not_an_sshnuke.c -o not_an_sshnuke
$ ./not_an_sshnuke /dev/pts/3
[*] Waiting for slave device /dev/pts/3
[+] Got PTY slave /dev/pts/3
[+] Making PTY slave the controlling terminal
[+] SUID shell at /tmp/sh
$ /tmp/sh --norc --noprofile -p
# id
euid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Thanks,
Federico Bento.
