Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-6008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `install.php` file in Web Reference Database (refbase) versions 0.9.6 and earlier is vulnerable to OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application uses the `exec()` function to execute a command constructed using user-supplied input, specifically the `pathToMYSQL` and `databaseStructureFile` POST parameters. There is insufficient sanitization of this input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server process.
*   **Compromise of Server:** This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data, installation of malware, or further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `install.php` with crafted `pathToMYSQL` and `databaseStructureFile` parameters.
*   **Remote File Paths:** The attacker can provide remote file paths for `pathToMYSQL` and `databaseStructureFile`.
*   **Remote SMB Share (Windows Specific):** On Windows, an attacker can specify a path to an executable on a remote SMB share, which will be executed by the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is present in `install.php` which is accessible without authentication.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs knowledge of the path where `mysql.exe` (or an equivalent executable on other OS) is stored to execute command.
*   **Windows Specific:** If using a remote SMB share for code execution, it is only applicable to the Windows environment.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db content provides a specific example of how to exploit the vulnerability on Windows by providing a remote SMB share path to an executable file via the `pathToMYSQL` parameter
* The vendor has not provided a patch for this specific vulnerability.
* It is suggested to remove `install.php` to prevent the exploit.

This vulnerability is considered high risk due to the potential for remote code execution.
