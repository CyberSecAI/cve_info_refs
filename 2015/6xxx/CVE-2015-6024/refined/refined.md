Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `ping.cgi` script of the NetCommWireless HSPA 3G10WVE Wireless Router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `DIA_IPADDRESS` parameter within the `ping.cgi` script is vulnerable to command injection. This means an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the operating system through this parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The router fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `DIA_IPADDRESS` parameter, allowing for the injection of shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System/Network Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router, leading to a complete system and potentially network compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker may be able to cause the device to become unstable or inoperable.
*   **Lateral Movement:** By compromising the router, an attacker could potentially use it as a stepping stone to reach other devices in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP/HTTPS requests to the router's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable router's web interface. This could be achieved through direct connection, or if the router is exposed to the internet, through the internet.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper authentication checks combined with command injection, meaning that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability without any authentication.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `DIA_IPADDRESS`
*   **Vulnerable Page:** `ping.cgi`
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC) URL:** `http(s)://<victim_IP>/ping.cgi?DIA_IPADDRESS=4.2.2.2;cat%20/etc/passwd`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that this vulnerability is often paired with CVE-2015-6023, which allows for unauthorized access to the `ping.cgi` page, making exploitation easier.
*   The CVSS score is 10.0, which is critical.
*   A firmware patch is available to address this issue: `ftp://files.planetnetcomm.com/3G10WVE/3G10WVE-L101-S306ETS-C01_R05.bin`
