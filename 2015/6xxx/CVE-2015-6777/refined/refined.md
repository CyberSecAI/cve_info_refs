  "CVE-2015-6777": {
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the ContainerNode::notifyNodeInsertedInternal function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp in the DOM implementation in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to DOMCharacterDataModified events for certain detached-subtree insertions.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is located in the ContainerNode::notifyNodeInsertedInternal function, specifically related to how it handles DOMCharacterDataModified events when inserting detached subtrees.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially have other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a crafted website that triggers the vulnerability when inserting detached subtrees, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a crafted website. The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is exploitable through the web browser."
