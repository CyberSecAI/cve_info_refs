Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the `apply` method of Function objects in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. By manipulating Javascript instructions within a PDF file, it's possible to bypass the intended restrictions on Javascript API execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Javascript API Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent the security measures put in place to limit what Javascript code can do within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This means the attacker could potentially take full control of the affected machine, install malware, steal data, etc.
* **Information Disclosure:** Although not the primary impact, security bypass could potentially lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can embed malicious Javascript instructions within a specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that contains code which exploits this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction. A user must either:
    *   Open a malicious PDF file
    *   Visit a malicious web page

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is specifically related to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
