Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the web GUI of the Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System. Specifically, a user with a *Monitor-Only* role can perform limited configuration changes which they are not supposed to be authorized to do.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The primary weakness is the ability for a user with a *Monitor-Only* role to escalate their privileges and make configuration changes beyond what is intended for their role. This indicates a flaw in access control and role-based permission implementation in the web GUI.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the web GUI, allowing unauthorized actions by users with limited roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Configuration Changes:** An attacker can perform limited configuration changes, which could potentially disrupt network operations or compromise the system's integrity. While the impact is not complete system compromise, it could still cause operational issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web GUI.
*   **Authenticated Attacker:** Exploitation requires an attacker to be authenticated to the system, although with the *Monitor-Only* role, which suggests an insider threat is a key aspect of this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System.
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with at least the *Monitor-Only* role.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Connected Grid Network Management System versions 3.0(0.35) and 3.0(0.54).
*   **CVSS Score:** Base Score of 4.0, Temporal Score of 3.3 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
*   **No Public Exploits:** The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   **No Workarounds:** No workarounds are available; a software update is necessary.
