Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way phpMyAdmin handled the reCAPTCHA verification process. It appears that once a user successfully completed the reCAPTCHA, the application would store a session variable (`last_valid_captcha`) indicating the successful verification. This variable was then improperly used which allowed bypassing subsequent reCAPTCHA checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Session Management:** The core issue was the use of a session variable to skip subsequent captcha checks after the initial successful verification, without proper validation in place for subsequent login attempts.
- **Bypass of Security Control:** The vulnerability effectively bypassed the intended security measure of reCAPTCHA, which is designed to prevent automated login attempts and brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Brute-force attacks:**  Attackers could bypass the reCAPTCHA check after solving it once, making it possible to launch automated brute-force attacks to guess user credentials without being blocked by the reCAPTCHA.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** Successful brute-force attacks could lead to the compromise of phpMyAdmin user accounts, potentially giving attackers access to databases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack would be performed through the phpMyAdmin login page, where the reCAPTCHA is normally displayed.
- **Automated Requests:**  After solving the reCAPTCHA once, an attacker could automate the process of login attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the phpMyAdmin web interface.
- **Initial reCAPTCHA Solution:** The attacker would need to solve the reCAPTCHA at least once to trigger the session variable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The phpMyAdmin team considered the vulnerability to be non-critical, as reCAPTCHA is an opt-in security measure, and is not enabled by default.
- The fix involved modifying the logic of how `last_valid_captcha` is checked and used in the authentication process.
- The vulnerability affected phpMyAdmin versions 4.3.x (prior to 4.3.13.2) and 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.14.1).
- The vulnerability is also related to CWE-661 (Incorrect Security Bypass) and CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts)
