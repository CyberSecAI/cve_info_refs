Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the CVE-2015-6485 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of Ethernet frame padding in Schneider Electric's Telvent SAGE 2300 and 2400 remote terminal units (RTUs). Specifically, when packets are smaller than the required minimum size of 56 bytes, the Ethernet driver is expected to pad the data field with null bytes (zeros). However, the affected devices were using data from a known memory region for padding instead of zeros.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Ethernet Frame Padding:** Instead of padding with zeros, the device uses data from memory.
- **Information Leakage:** The memory data used for padding could contain sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially eavesdrop on network traffic and extract sensitive information leaked through the improperly padded Ethernet frames.
- **Passive Attack:** The attacker can only view the data sent out by the affected device and cannot inject or modify traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable device can capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker positioned between the device and its intended recipient can intercept and analyze traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable RTU, or in a position to intercept its traffic.
- **Low Skill:** The attack is considered to be of low difficulty.
