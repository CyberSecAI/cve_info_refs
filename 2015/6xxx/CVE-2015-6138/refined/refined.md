- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer disables HTML attributes via the XSS filter. It incorrectly disables HTML attributes, creating a condition where malicious scripts can run in the wrong security context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS filter bypass vulnerability. The XSS filter incorrectly disables HTML attributes in filtered HTTP response data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause scripts to run on another user's system in the guise of a third-party website, potentially leading to information disclosure. The malicious script can take any action that the third-party website is permitted to take on the user's system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to post specially crafted content on a website designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince the user to view the content on the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to post content on a website and convince users to visit the page. The user must also click on a malicious hypertext link to trigger the vulnerability.
