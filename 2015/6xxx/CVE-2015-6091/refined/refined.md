- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. This could be achieved through email attachments or by enticing users to visit a website hosting the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted file and then either convince a user to open the file, or host the file on a website and convince users to visit the website and open the file. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access beyond the ability to send files or host websites.
