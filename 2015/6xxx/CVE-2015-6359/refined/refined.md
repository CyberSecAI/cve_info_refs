Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco IOS XE Software handles IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets. Specifically, it seems there is a buffer overflow in processing ND messages, which allows attackers to cause a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-119:**  Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. This indicates a buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation can cause the affected Cisco device to crash, leading to a denial of service. This disrupts network operations and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device. They don't need to be directly connected, but rather within the same broadcast domain or VLAN.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to send malicious IPv6 ND packets.
*   **No Credentials Required:**  No authentication or user interaction is required to send the malformed packets and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft IPv6 ND Packets:**  The attacker must be able to craft or manipulate IPv6 ND packets to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**  Cisco IOS XE Software releases prior to 15.5(2)S2 (3.15.2S) and 15.5(3)S1 (3.16.1S) are vulnerable.
*   **Workaround:** Cisco provides a workaround to limit the amount of IPv6 neighbors an interface will learn using the `ipv6 nd cache interface-limit` command.
*   **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS v2 score is Base 6.1 and Temporal 5.0, with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C, which indicates an adjacent attack vector, low complexity, no authentication required and a complete impact on availability. The 'F' exploitability means there is functional exploit code.
*   **Mitigation**: Software updates to versions including and above  15.5(2)S2 (3.15.2S) and 15.5(3)S1 (3.16.1S) are available to fix the vulnerability.
