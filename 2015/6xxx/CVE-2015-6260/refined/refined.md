Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-6260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) within SNMP packets processed by Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of sufficient validation of SNMP PDU content within received packets. This allows a malformed packet to trigger an error.
*   **Denial of Service:** Sending crafted SNMP packets exploits the improper input validation, resulting in the SNMP application unexpectedly restarting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SNMP Application Restart:** An attacker can cause the SNMP application to restart by sending malformed SNMP packets.
*   **System-Level Restart:** Repeated restarts of the SNMP application can lead to a system-level restart of the affected device, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Crafted SNMP Packets:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted SNMP packets to the vulnerable devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco device.
*   **SNMP Protocol Knowledge:** An understanding of the SNMP protocol is needed to craft the malicious packets.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform Switches
*   Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches
*   Cisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches
*   Specifically, devices running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.1(1)N1(1)

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to a version of NX-OS Software specified in the advisory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-20, which relates to improper input validation.
*   The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   Exploitation of this vulnerability can generate an SNMP core file.
*   There are no known workarounds that address this vulnerability.
