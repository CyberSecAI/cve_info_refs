{
  "CVE-2015-6908": {
    "description": "The ber_get_next function in OpenLDAP 2.4.42 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reachable assertion and application crash) via crafted BER data, as demonstrated by an attack against slapd.",
    "vulnerability": "An input validation issue exists in OpenLDAP's ber_get_next function, causing a reachable assertion and application crash.",
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated client can cause a denial of service by crashing the OpenLDAP server (slapd).",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the OpenLDAP server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target OpenLDAP server.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of BER data in the ber_get_next function. The root cause is that production binaries were built with assertions enabled instead of compiling with -DNDEBUG. The issue is fixed by removing the assert statement in the ber_get_next method, ensuring that even with crafted BER data, no crash occurs."
