Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6149

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of `CTableCell` objects with manipulated `colspan` attributes within Microsoft Internet Explorer. Specifically, it involves the incorrect use of an internal array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper indexing within an internal array when processing `CTableCell` objects with manipulated `colspan` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This could lead to the attacker gaining the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking full control of the system if the user has administrative privileges.
- The attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability via Internet Explorer, convincing the user to visit it.
- Malicious file: An attacker could embed malicious content within a file which, when opened by a user using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, could lead to code execution.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-content accepting websites to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website containing the malicious code, or deliver a malicious file via other means.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file. This typically involves social engineering, like enticement via email or instant message.
- No special privileges are needed initially as the code execution occurs within the context of the current user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (specifically, IE 8 and IE 9).
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2015-09-08, and the advisory was publicly released on 2015-12-08.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID (20828).
