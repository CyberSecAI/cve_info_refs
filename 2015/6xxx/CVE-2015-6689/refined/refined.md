Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC handles the `WillSave` document action. A specially crafted `WillSave` action can lead to a dangling pointer being reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This leads to a dangling pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process (the user's). This could allow the attacker to gain control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is remote, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the user's system.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that contains the crafted `WillSave` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious document or page containing a specially crafted `WillSave` document action that triggers the use-after-free.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page containing the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2015-06-11, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2015-10-13
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "critical" by Adobe and given a CVSS score of 6.8.
*   The advisory also acknowledges AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative for reporting this vulnerability.
