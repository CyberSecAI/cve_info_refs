Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how VBScript improperly discloses the content of its memory. Specifically, the VBScript `CreateObject` function is flawed in its implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-After-Free (inferred):** The ZDI advisory mentions a use-after-free, but does not go into detail on the exact nature of the issue.
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is that VBScript exposes memory contents, which could reveal sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to the contents of memory, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application or system.
- **Secondary Exploitation:** The disclosed memory information can be used by attackers to chain with other vulnerabilities for further exploitation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** Attackers can host a malicious website containing specially crafted VBScript code to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious file:**  Attackers can deliver a malicious file (e.g. via email or other methods) that, when opened using a vulnerable application such as Internet Explorer, will execute the malicious VBScript.
- **Compromised/User-provided content:** An attacker can leverage compromised websites or websites that host user provided content (or advertisements) to host malicious VBScript to exploit this vulnerability.
- **ActiveX controls:** An attacker could embed an ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Internet Explorer rendering engine. This control can redirect the user to a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a web server.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the exploit.
- **Knowledge of Memory Addresses:** The attacker needs knowledge of the memory address where the vulnerable object was created to trigger the vulnerability, which can be done through malicious crafting of the VBScript code.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is located in `vbscript.dll` which is part of the Windows Operating System.
- Microsoft has released security updates (MS15-126 and MS15-124) to address this vulnerability by modifying how VBScript handles objects in memory.
- The ZDI advisory identifies Simon Zuckerbraun as the discoverer of the vulnerability.
-  This vulnerability is also addressed by Internet Explorer cumulative update 3104002 for systems with Internet Explorer 8 or later versions.
-  For IE 7 or earlier, and systems without IE, the vulnerability is addressed by update 3105579.
