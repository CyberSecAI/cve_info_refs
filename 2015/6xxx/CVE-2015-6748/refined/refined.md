Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in how the jsoup library handles HTML tags that are not properly closed with a ">" before the end of the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Tag Handling:** jsoup incorrectly parses HTML when tags lack a closing ">" character at the end of the input.
*   **XSS Vector:** This incorrect parsing can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where malicious HTML snippets can bypass sanitization and be interpreted as valid by the browser, leading to arbitrary script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code that can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser.
*   **Compromise of User Data:** This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** The vulnerability allowed malicious input to pass through the `@SafeHtml` annotation provided by Hibernate Validator (which uses JSoup for sanitization).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML Injection:** Attackers would inject specially crafted HTML containing incomplete tags at the end of the input.
*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when user-provided HTML is processed by the vulnerable JSoup library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by the vulnerable JSoup library.
*   The attacker does not require any special permissions or privileges in the vulnerable system; this is a client-side issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered during a security review and was found to bypass the validation provided by Hibernate Validator's `@SafeHtml` annotation.
*   The fix was to upgrade jsoup to version 1.8.3, which corrected the parsing behavior related to unclosed tags.
*   The issue was addressed in various Red Hat products, including JBoss BRMS and JBoss BPM Suite.
*   Debian also released a security update (DLA 2075-1) for jsoup to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists in the processing of client-provided HTML and thus is client side.
