### @fazerish **[fazerish](/fazerish)** commented [May 27, 2015](#issue-81324312)

We use Hibernate Validator (HV) and the @SafeHtlm annotation to validate input from users. During a security review we discovered that an unsafe XSS vector slipped by the validator. During debugging HV we discovered that the source of the problem was related to how Jsoup handled tags without a closing > when reaching EOF.

[Code reference to SafeHtmlValidator in HV](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/dfa65141d63cbfbb33f79522f6ba40a6d2b29b5c/engine/src/main/java/org/hibernate/validator/internal/constraintvalidators/hv/SafeHtmlValidator.java#L75)

Use CVE-2015-6748 for this jsoup vulnerability.

(Although the <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/28/3>
message mentions "We use Hibernate Validator (HV) ..." in its quoted
text, this does not mean that the Hibernate Validator product is used
by the jsoup product. The actual relationship is that jsoup is used by
Hibernate Validator (and jsoup is used by WildFly).)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1258310#c0)  Timothy Walsh    2015-08-31 04:42:26 UTC  ``` We have identified a small vulnerability in Hibernate Validator which is used in at least WildFly and JBoss EAP.  <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-5223> [Open URL] <https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1012> [Open URL] The vulnerability is in the dependency jsoup. Our understanding is that the likely vector OS that : - an app developer guards a field as safe html via Hibernate Validator - a malicious user sends a non safe html snippet not properly detected - the application then uses the html believing it is safe.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1258310#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-31 12:11:51 UTC  ``` CVE assignment:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/28/5>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1258310#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-07 20:47:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2015:2560 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2560.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1258310#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-07 20:49:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2015:2559 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2559.html>   ``` |  |

An issue has been found in jsoup, a Java HTML parser that makes sense of
real-world HTML soup. Due to bad handling of missing '>' at EOF a
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability could appear.
