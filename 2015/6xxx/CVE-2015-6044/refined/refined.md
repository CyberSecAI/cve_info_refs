- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This can potentially allow a script to run with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper permission validation in Internet Explorer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. This could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) to run arbitrary code at a higher integrity level.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability. They could also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content. The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website, usually by tricking them into clicking a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject content into a website that an Internet Explorer user will visit. They also need to trick the user into taking an action like clicking a link.
