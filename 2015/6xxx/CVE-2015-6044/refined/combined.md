## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3096441)

Published: October 13, 2015 | Updated: January 27, 2016

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer, JScript, VBScript and certain functions handle objects in memory
* Adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3096441](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3096441).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer, render. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2482](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2482) | No | No |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6055](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6055) | No | No |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6056](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6056) | Yes | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Restrict access to VBScript.dll and JScript.dll**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N
    cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```

  **Impact of Workaround.** Websites that use VBScript or JScript may not work properly.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```

## Multiple Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing a script to be run with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

The vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit the vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding permission validations to Internet Explorer.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6044](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6044) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6047](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6047) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6051](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6051) | No | No |

     Regedit.exe /e rdpfile_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File
     Regedit.exe /e rdp_HKCU_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp

     ```
  2. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (that is Delete\_rdp\_file\_association.reg):

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File]
     [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp]

     ```
  3. Run the registry script that you created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /s Delete_rdp_file_association.reg

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Double-clicking an .rdp file will no longer start mstsc.exe.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  Restore the registry key by using Regedit to restore the settings saved in the .REG files.

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6053

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly discloses the contents of its memory.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could provide the attacker with information to further compromise the userâs system.

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way certain functions handle objects in memory. Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## VBScript and JScript ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-6052

A security feature bypass exists when the VBScript and JScript engines fail to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, and browses to a malicious website. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from ASLR bypasses. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses this ASLR bypass by helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
