Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-6961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect issue in web2py. The application was not properly validating the `_next` parameter, which is intended to redirect users after login or other actions. Specifically, it was only checking for open redirects within the `login()` function, but not in other areas that use the `_next` parameter, like the `get_vars_next` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacked proper validation of the `_next` parameter, failing to restrict the redirection to only internal URLs.
- **Inconsistent Handling:** The check for open redirects was implemented in the `login()` function, but not consistently applied in other parts of the application where the `_next` parameter was used, creating an inconsistency.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Open Redirection:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing a `_next` parameter that redirects the user to an arbitrary external domain.
- **Phishing:** This vulnerability could be leveraged in phishing attacks, where users are redirected to malicious websites that mimic the legitimate application, potentially leading to credential theft or other security breaches.
- **Malware Distribution:** Users could also be redirected to sites that distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a URL containing a `_next` parameter with a malicious URL as its value.
- This malicious URL is sent to the victim user, often via social engineering.
- When the user clicks on the link, they are redirected to the attacker's controlled site instead of the intended resource, especially if the user is not already logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and send them to the victim.
- No prior access to the web2py application is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker leverages the fact that the `_next` parameter isn't properly validated. The issue was discovered by a user submitting a malicious link containing `_next` to `admin/default/index` and a password. If the password was valid, the user was redirected to the site specified in the `send` parameter (which was used as the value for `_next`).

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The commit message `Security fix: Validate for open redirect everywhere, not just in login()` clearly states the scope of the fix.
- The code diff shows that validation for open redirects has been added to the `get_vars_next()` function, which retrieves the `_next` variable. The code checks to ensure that the host in the `_next` parameter matches the server's `http_host`.
- The original issue report notes that the redirection happens if a user is not already authenticated.
- The issue was initially reported through Google Code.
- A medium severity was assigned to this issue by the reporter, due to the requirement of an administrative password to trigger the redirection. However, this is incorrect, as the redirection is triggered for all users that are not authenticated, with a crafted `_next` URL.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and its implications.
