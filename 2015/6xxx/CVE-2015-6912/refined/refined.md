Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-6912:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Command Injection:** A vulnerability in the `subtitle.cgi` script due to insufficient sanitization of the `subtitle_codepage` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in `watchstatus.cgi` and `audiotrack.cgi` scripts due to insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** Allows execution of arbitrary system commands with root privileges.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows execution of arbitrary SQL statements with DBA privileges, potentially compromising the PostgreSQL database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** Complete compromise of the Synology DiskStation NAS, including all stored data and using the NAS as a stepping stone for attacks on other systems.
*   **SQL Injection:** Compromise of the PostgreSQL database server, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   By sending a crafted GET request to `/webapi/VideoStation/subtitle.cgi` with a malicious payload in the `subtitle_codepage` parameter.
    *   Can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers if the 'public share' option is enabled.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   By sending crafted POST requests to `/webapi/VideoStation/watchstatus.cgi` and `/webapi/VideoStation/audiotrack.cgi` with malicious SQL payloads in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NAS device.
    *   For unauthenticated exploitation, the 'public share' option of the Synology Video Station needs to be enabled.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NAS device.
    *   Requires knowledge of the API endpoints and parameters, though this information is fairly straightforward to obtain.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory details specific vulnerable scripts: `subtitle.cgi`, `watchstatus.cgi`, and `audiotrack.cgi`.
*   The `subtitle.cgi` vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication if the 'public share' setting is enabled.
*   The advisory provides proof-of-concept exploits for each vulnerability, including commands to establish a reverse shell via the command injection.
*   The SQL injection vulnerabilities are exploitable through `id` parameters within the respective CGI scripts.
*   The advisory mentions that `X-SYNO-TOKEN` provides CSRF protection which might be a limiting factor if the attacker is not able to get the token. However, it can be bypassed by exploiting a different vulnerability which allows the attacker to grab the token.

This information provides a more in-depth understanding of the vulnerabilities than the typical CVE description, which is a placeholder in this case.
