Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6828:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `file_get_contents()` to fetch data over HTTP without TLS, followed by an `unserialize()` operation on the retrieved content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` on data fetched over an unencrypted channel allows for the potential injection of malicious code through crafted serialized objects.
- **Plaintext Communication:** The use of HTTP instead of HTTPS makes the data transmission vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the communication and inject malicious data, which would then be unserialized, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious serialized data, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the webserver, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the system and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP request between the WordPress server and the external URL (`http://api.tweetmeme.com/url_info.php?url=$url`).
- **Data Injection:** The attacker injects malicious serialized data in the response to the HTTP request.
- **Exploitation via `unserialize()`:**  The vulnerable plugin uses `unserialize()` on the manipulated data, leading to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MitM attack, typically by having access to the network path between the vulnerable server and the external server or control over a network device involved in that path.
- **Understanding of serialized PHP objects:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PHP serialized object that will execute desired code upon unserialization.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the presence of the vulnerable plugin and its reliance on `unserialize()` of external data.
