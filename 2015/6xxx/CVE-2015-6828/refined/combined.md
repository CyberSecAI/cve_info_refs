Subject: Some Wordpress Plugin Stuff

Hi OSS Sec,

I took a quick glance through some Wordpress plugins tagged with security.
I don't imagine anyone would be surprised that I found vulnerabilities.

-------------------------------

SecurityMoz Security Audit

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/securemoz-security-audit/>

file_get_contents() + explicitly HTTP (no TLS) -> unserialize()

-------------------------------

WP Limit Login Attempts

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-limit-login-attempts/>

Trivial SQL injection via HTTP headers.

     $ip = getip();
     $tablename = $wpdb->prefix."limit_login";
     $tablerows = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT `login_id`,
`login_ip`,`login_attempts`,`attempt_time`,`locked_time` FROM  `$tablename`
  WHERE `login_ip` =  '$ip'  ORDER BY `login_id` DESC LIMIT 1 " );

     // ~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~8<~

    function getip(){
           if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
        } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
            $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
        } else {
            $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
             if($ip=='::1'){
                 $ip = '127.0.0.1';
             }
        }
        return $ip;
    }

-------------------------------

I'm not sure if it's even worth assigning a CVE to any of these. Maybe the
SQLi one? I leave that decision in MITRE's capable hands.

Also, Tor Blocker (link below) uses HTTP to grab the list of IP addresses
to block. It's telling and appropriate that the person who developed a
plugin to oppose a privacy technology would fail to use TLS.

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/tor-exit-nodes-blocker/>

(Surely no one would ever think to hack an upstream router and MitM the
connection to block the blog administrator from their own blog or allow Tor
nodes through!)

That's all from me. I might keep poking at some of the fatter plugins to
see what I can find.

In a brute force attack, аutоmаtеd software iѕ uѕеd tо gеnеrаtе a lаrgе numbеr оf соnѕесutivе guesses аѕ to thе value of thе desired data. Brute force attack may bе uѕеd by сriminаlѕ tо crack еnсrурtеd dаtа, оr bу security аnаlуѕtѕ to tеѕt an оrgаnizаtiоn’ѕ nеtwоrk security.

## Installation

1. Download and extract plugin files to a wp-content/plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface.
3. Done !

## FAQ

### Why I am seeing an, “Please wait 10 minutes” error message when I try to login?

You are tried to login with wrong password or username more than five times.

So please wait 10 minutes, then reset password by clicking “lost your password” link.

### Is it working in localhost ?

Yes.. It will work in your local machine also.

### Captcha image is not working, How to solve it ?

Just make captcha.php file accessible in .htaccess file located in root or wp-contet or plugin folder then try.

Enable GD extention in php.ini

Uncomment this line in php.ini file: extension=php\_gd2.dll (remove the leading 😉

Or just contact hosting provider (They will enable GD extension)

We don't think that we can assign a CVE ID for this. The product
relies on data at the <http://pike.hqpeak.com/api/free.php> URL; that
data is not currently available at the
<https://pike.hqpeak.com/api/free.php> URL or any other HTTPS URL that
we know about. Apparently the risk in using HTTP is
incorrect/incomplete data, not code execution. If MITM attacks occur,
the product user could typically recover from them by deleting
unwanted postings and by establishing their own administrative login
from a different IP address. MITM attacks aren't likely to occur
continuously. Given that the data is only available via HTTP (not
HTTPS) and the product user wants the data, we're unable to reach a
conclusion that the <http://pike.hqpeak.com> URL is necessarily a
vulnerability without knowing the vendor's perspective. One possible
example is that the vendor didn't want to support HTTPS in case the
plugin became very popular and the pike.hqpeak.com server was unable
to support all of the load of cryptography calculations.
