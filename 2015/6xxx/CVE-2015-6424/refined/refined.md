Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the boot process of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC). Specifically, it's due to insecure credentials during the boot process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Credentials (CWE-255):** The primary weakness is the presence of insecure credentials that are accessible during the boot process. This allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication procedures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Access:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain access to the APIC as the *root* user, which grants them complete control over the system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, the attacker can perform any action on the system, including but not limited to:
    *   Modifying configurations
    *   Accessing sensitive data
    *   Installing malicious software
    *   Disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the APIC device. The attacker needs to be physically present or have some form of local access to the device.
*   **Boot Process Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited during the boot process, meaning the attacker needs to interfere with the boot procedure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local (physical or remote, if possible) access to the affected Cisco APIC device.
*   **Authentication:** While the CVE description mentions "authenticated, local attacker", this is in contrast to the root level access the attacker gains from exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a good understanding of the APIC boot process and how to exploit the insecure credentials present.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** Cisco APIC release 1.1(0.920a) is specifically identified as vulnerable.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
*  **CVSS Score:** Base score is 6.8, temporal score is 5.9 which corresponds to the vector AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
