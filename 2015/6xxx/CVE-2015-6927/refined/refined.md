{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how vzctl determines the virtual environment (VE) layout. It relies on the presence of `root.hdd/DiskDescriptor.xml` within the VE's private directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure determination of VE layout",
      "Reliance on file presence for critical decisions",
      "Symlink attack vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with root privileges in a simfs-based container can gain control over ploop-based containers, potentially allowing them to change the root password and access control panels.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to a simfs container",
      "Exploitation of insecure VE layout detection",
      "Symlink attack on the ploop container's root.hdd file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
        "Root privileges within a simfs-based container",
        "Ability to create symlinks"
