Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the `contrib` directory of GeSHi (Generic Syntax Highlighter) within the MediaWiki's SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi extension. This directory contained scripts that were not thoroughly vetted for performance and security within the MediaWiki environment. Specifically, the `langcheck.php` script was identified as a potential resource consumption DoS vector due to its slow execution time without any throttling mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource Consumption DoS:** The `langcheck.php` script, when executed, could consume significant server resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This script took 5-6 seconds to execute without any means to limit its execution, making it a stealthy DoS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger the execution of the vulnerable scripts, such as `langcheck.php`, causing the server to become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, potentially unauthenticated:** An attacker could send crafted requests to execute the vulnerable scripts via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access and trigger the execution of the vulnerable scripts within the MediaWiki environment. They do not need specific user privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `contrib` directory was unintentionally re-included in MediaWiki 1.25, highlighting a policy error in how the GeSHi integration was managed.
- The fix involved removing the entire `contrib` directory from the MediaWiki extension.
- While this CVE is focused on the resource-consumption DoS, other files in the `contrib` directory were also found to have other vulnerabilities like XSS, which were assigned separate CVEs (e.g. CVE-2015-6734).

In summary, CVE-2015-6733 addresses a DoS vulnerability caused by poorly vetted scripts included within the GeSHi extension's contrib directory in MediaWiki, specifically the resource consumption through `langcheck.php`.
