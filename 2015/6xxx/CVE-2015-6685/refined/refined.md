Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the handling of fields in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- Specifically, a specially crafted PDF file with specific fields containing a "Format" action can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after the memory it points to has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is the re-use of memory after it has been freed, leading to a dangling pointer.
- **Memory Corruption:** This dangling pointer and subsequent access leads to memory corruption, as noted in the Adobe Security Bulletin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user's process.
- **Control of Affected System:** The Adobe Security Bulletin notes that this and other vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file with specific fields and a "Format" action.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction - the target must either visit a malicious page or open the malicious PDF file.
- **Network:** The attack can be launched remotely via a malicious website or by delivering the crafted PDF through network means (e.g email attachment)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PDF file to include the specially crafted fields with format actions to trigger the use-after-free condition.
- **Ability to Deliver PDF to Target:** The attacker must be able to get the malicious PDF in front of the target user (through a website, email, or another vector).
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Reader DC on Windows and Macintosh platforms.
-  The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative
-  Adobe released a security update to address this vulnerability as part of a larger set of fixes.
