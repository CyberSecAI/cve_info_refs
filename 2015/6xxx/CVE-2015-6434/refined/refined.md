**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is due to improper input validation (CWE-20).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute an XFS attack. The impact is only on integrity, as reflected in the CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N). Successful exploitation could potentially lead to the attacker injecting malicious content in the web interface.

- The attack is carried out through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes a link to an Applied Mitigation Bulletin about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which is relevant to understanding the nature of the attack but the vulnerability itself is described as XFS, not XSS.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The advisory does not mention any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
