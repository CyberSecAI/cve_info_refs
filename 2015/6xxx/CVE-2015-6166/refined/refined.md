- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Silverlight incorrectly handles certain open and close requests, leading to read- and write-access violations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect handling of open and close requests resulting in read- and write-access violations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote code execution, potentially granting the attacker the same permissions as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector involves an attacker hosting a website with a specially crafted Silverlight application. The attacker then needs to convince the user to visit this compromised website. This can be achieved through various means, such as enticing the user to click a link in an email or instant message, or by exploiting websites that accept or host user-provided content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a website with a malicious Silverlight application and convince the user to visit the site. No additional special capabilities are mentioned beyond this.
