Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in several parameters of the Bedita CMS, specifically in the `cfg[projectName]`, `data[stats_provider_url]`, and `data[description]` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into these fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is persistent (stored) XSS. Malicious scripts injected via the vulnerable parameters are stored in the application's database and executed whenever a user views the affected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of users who interact with the application. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
   - **Data Theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
   - **Content Modification:** Changing the appearance or content of the website, potentially redirecting users to phishing sites.
   - **Session Hijacking:** Impersonating legitimate users and performing actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted POST request to the server with malicious JavaScript payload injected in the vulnerable parameters.
    - `cfg[projectName]` parameter in `/admin/saveConfig`
    - `data[stats_provider_url]` parameter in `/areas/saveArea`
    - `data[description]` parameter in `/areas/saveSection`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject these scripts as they will be executed within other user's sessions.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that can be used to gain access or control over the website or the users of the website.
