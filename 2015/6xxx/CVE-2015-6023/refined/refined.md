Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-6023:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the `ping.cgi` page of the NetCommWireless HSPA 3G10WVE Wireless Router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the router's network troubleshooting page (ping.cgi).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the `ping.cgi` page without authentication. This access, combined with a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-6024) in the same page, allows for complete system/network compromise. This includes the potential for:
   - Unauthorized access to router settings
   - Execution of arbitrary commands on the router
   - Potential control over network traffic

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2015-6023 describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the `ping.cgi` page of the NetCommWireless HSPA 3G10WVE Wireless Router. This vulnerability, when chained with a command injection vulnerability, allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to achieve full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered via a specifically crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `ping.cgi` page.
