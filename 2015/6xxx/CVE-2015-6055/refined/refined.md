Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6055, extracted from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `Filter` function (as per ZDI advisory) or `Join` function (as per another ZDI advisory) in VBScript. By passing unexpected arguments to these functions, an attacker can cause an integer to be incorrectly interpreted as a pointer to an object in memory. This allows for memory corruption

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion**: The VBScript engine misinterprets an integer value as a memory pointer, leading to type confusion.
- **Memory Corruption**: By controlling the integer that is treated as a pointer, the attacker can manipulate memory in a way that leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could potentially take full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:**
  - An attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. They then need to convince the user to visit the malicious page using Internet Explorer.
  - Attackers can also leverage compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements, by embedding malicious code.
- **File-Based Attack:**
    - An attacker can embed a malicious VBScript in a file that is opened by the user.
- **ActiveX Control:** Embedding an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote**: The attacker can be remote, delivering the exploit via a website or malicious file.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The target must visit a malicious page, open a malicious file, or interact with content containing a malicious ActiveX control.
- **Knowledge of VBScript Vulnerability:** The attacker must be able to craft the exploit by providing unexpected arguments to the vulnerable VBScript function.
