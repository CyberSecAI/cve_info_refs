There's an integer overflow issue in sanity checking section lengths when parsing the vcdiff format (used in SDCH content encoding). This results in the parser parsing outside of sane memory bounds when parsing the contents of a vcdiff window - see attached crash PoC.

(/src/sdch/open-vcdiff/src/headerparser.cc)

bool VCDiffHeaderParser::ParseSectionLengths(
    bool has_checksum,
    size_t* add_and_run_data_length,
    size_t* instructions_and_sizes_length,
    size_t* addresses_length,
    VCDChecksum* checksum) {
  ParseSize("length of data for ADDs and RUNs", add_and_run_data_length); //     <---- user controlled
  ParseSize("length of instructions section", instructions_and_sizes_length); // <---- user controlled
  ParseSize("length of addresses for COPYs", addresses_length); //               <---- user controlled
  if (has_checksum) {
    ParseChecksum("Adler32 checksum value", checksum);
  }
  if (RESULT_SUCCESS != return_code_) {
    return false;
  }
  if (!delta_encoding_start_) {
    VCD_DFATAL << "Internal error: VCDiffHeaderParser::ParseSectionLengths "
                  "was called before ParseWindowLengths" << VCD_ENDL;
    return_code_ = RESULT_ERROR;
    return false;
  }
  const size_t delta_encoding_header_length =
      UnparsedData() - delta_encoding_start_;
  if (delta_encoding_length_ !=
          (delta_encoding_header_length +
           *add_and_run_data_length +
           *instructions_and_sizes_length +
           *addresses_length)) {  //                     <---- Integer overflow here (32-bit systems only)
    VCD_ERROR << "The length of the delta encoding does not match "
                 "the size of the header plus the sizes of the data sections"
              << VCD_ENDL;
    return_code_ = RESULT_ERROR;
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

These returned lengths are subsequently used to initialise length-checked buffer objects for continuing the parsing (vcdecoder.cc:1024)

size_t add_and_run_data_length = 0;
  size_t instructions_and_sizes_length = 0;
  size_t addresses_length = 0;
  if (!header_parser->ParseSectionLengths(has_checksum_,
                                          &add_and_run_data_length,
                                          &instructions_and_sizes_length,
                                          &addresses_length,
                                          &expected_checksum_)) {
    return header_parser->GetResult();
  }
  if (parent_->AllowInterleaved() &&
    // snip...
  } else {
    // If interleaved format is not used, then the whole window contents
    // must be available before decoding can begin.  If only part of
    // the current window is available, then report end of data
    // and re-parse the whole header when DecodeChunk() is called again.
    if (header_parser->UnparsedSize() < (add_and_run_data_length +
                                         instructions_and_sizes_length +
                                         addresses_length)) {
      return RESULT_END_OF_DATA;
    }
    data_for_add_and_run_.Init(header_parser->UnparsedData(),
                               add_and_run_data_length);
    instructions_and_sizes_.Init(data_for_add_and_run_.End(),
                                 instructions_and_sizes_length);
    addresses_for_copy_.Init(instructions_and_sizes_.End(), addresses_length);

This issue only affects 32-bit builds, since ParseSize is parsing a positive int32_t; on 64-bit builds it cannot be large enough to wrap a size_t.

It's unclear if this is exploitable as a browser-process infoleak; the results of SDCH decoding will be returned to a renderer process, but the way that the returned values are used mean that it is likely that the process will have to survive reads at opposite ends of the address space, which *should* be guaranteed to crash with a 2:2 address space split. It is possible that on 32-bit Windows with a 1:3 address space split this can be survived, or with careful crafting of the input file these reads can be avoided; I've not investigated further at this point.

It appears to be necessary to host the PoC on a legitimate domain; as localhost is not supported for SDCH.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/10/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, October 13, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 46 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 46.0.2490.71 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/45.0.2454.101..46.0.2490.71?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 46.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [24 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M46&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[542517](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=542517)] CVE-2015-6763: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* [[529489](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=529489)] CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182, CVE-2015-7183: NSS and NSPR memory corruption issues.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.6 branch (currently 4.6.85.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Details

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would

incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-6755](/security/CVE-2015-6755))

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6757](/security/CVE-2015-6757))

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of

LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-6759](/security/CVE-2015-6759))

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-6761](/security/CVE-2015-6761))

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use

CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6762](/security/CVE-2015-6762))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6763](/security/CVE-2015-6763))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-7834](/security/CVE-2015-7834))

## Details

USN-2770-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Oxide in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

15.04. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 15.10.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would

incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-6755](/security/CVE-2015-6755))

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6757](/security/CVE-2015-6757))

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of

LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-6759](/security/CVE-2015-6759))

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-6761](/security/CVE-2015-6761))

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use

CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6762](/security/CVE-2015-6762))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6763](/security/CVE-2015-6763))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-7834](/security/CVE-2015-7834))
