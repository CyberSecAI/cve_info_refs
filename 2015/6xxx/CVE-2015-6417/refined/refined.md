*   **Unauthorized Database Access:**  Authenticated users, who should not have such privileges, can gain read and write access to an internal database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  An attacker can read sensitive information stored within the internal database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can also write to the database, potentially altering data, and impacting the integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Authentication Required:** An attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for the Cisco VDS-SM system.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a network connection.
