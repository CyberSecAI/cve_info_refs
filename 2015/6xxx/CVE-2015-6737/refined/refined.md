Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Widgets` extension's insecure handling of base64 encoded content. It trusts the base64 encoded content on the page, decodes it, and outputs it without proper sanitization. This approach is fundamentally flawed as the content is user-controlled, making it susceptible to injection attacks. The extension also includes a secret key along with the encoded content, which is easily obtainable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Handling of Base64 Encoded Content:** The `Widgets` extension directly decodes and outputs base64 encoded content from the page, leading to a potential HTML injection vulnerability.
*  **Easily Obtainable Secret Key:** The secret key used for "defense" is easily obtained by anyone who can view the page source and examine the encoded content.
*   **Reliance on Hiding the Content:**  The extension attempts to hide the content with a UNIQ marker in the parser, but this is not a robust security measure. It was previously possible to retrieve the content behind the UNIQ marker using Scribunto's `mw.text.unstrip` function, and any method to reveal this content would expose the vulnerability again.
*   **Incorrect Integrity Protection:** The primary vulnerability is not just the HTML injection itself, but the overall flawed approach to integrity protection, trusting client-side data and encoding instead of proper server-side validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the page, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected HTML contains Javascript.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** Depending on the context and if the injected HTML includes Javascript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
*   **Vandalism:** An attacker can modify the appearance of the page or add malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously Crafted Base64 Encoded Content:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML by crafting base64 encoded content and embedding it into the page using the `Widgets` extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Edit Pages:** An attacker needs the ability to edit pages where the `Widgets` extension is used to inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves changing how the extension handles content by storing an index on the page and using that to retrieve the content from an array, rather than trusting content from the page itself. This new approach will prevent the need to encode and decode the content and fix the flawed integrity protection.
*   The issue was initially a private security bug, and the patch was initially uploaded publicly by mistake.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable in the latest versions of Scribunto that doesn't allow the `mw.text.unstrip` function to work on the UNIQ marker, but it's still present in the extension logic.
*   CVE-2015-6737 is specifically assigned to the HTML injection vulnerability in the `Widgets` extension as reported by MediaWiki developer Majr.
