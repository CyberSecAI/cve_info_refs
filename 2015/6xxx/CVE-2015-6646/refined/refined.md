  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "SysV IPC is not supported in any Android Kernel. This was removed from the OS because it exposes additional attack surface that doesn't add functionality to the system. The allocated resources are also not freeable by the memory manager leading to global kernel resource leakage.",

      "Unnecessary attack surface in kernel.",
      "Global kernel resource leakage."
