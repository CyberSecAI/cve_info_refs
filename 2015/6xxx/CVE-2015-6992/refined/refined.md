**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory corruption issues due to insufficient bounds checking in the CoreText framework while handling font files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted font file. This can be achieved by:
1. Visiting a maliciously crafted webpage containing the malicious font.
2. Opening/processing the malicious font file directly by an application using CoreText.
