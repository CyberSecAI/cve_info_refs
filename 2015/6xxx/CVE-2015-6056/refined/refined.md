Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the VBScript and JScript engines handle objects in memory within Internet Explorer. Specifically, there is a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The scripting engines (VBScript, JScript) improperly manage memory, leading to potential corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convinces a user to view the website via Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious code can be injected into compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content.
- **ActiveX controls:** Embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" into an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine is another attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted webpage or other malicious content (ActiveX control, etc.).
- The attacker must trick the user into viewing this malicious content using Internet Explorer. This often involves social engineering tactics, like sending links in messages or via email.
- No user interaction is needed beyond the victim navigating to the attacker controlled content.
