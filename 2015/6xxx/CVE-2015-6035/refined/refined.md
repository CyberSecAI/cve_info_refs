Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-6035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient filtering of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) data before it is stored and displayed by the Opsview web application. This leads to both stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious code injected via SNMP traps is stored within the application and executed when a user views the relevant page (SNMP Trap Exceptions).
*  **Reflected XSS:** Malicious code is injected via SNMP agent responses during SNMP Walk operations. The code is executed immediately when the results are displayed to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution within an authenticated user's browser session.
*   The attacker can gain access to the authenticated user's cookies and perform actions with the user's privileges within the web application. This can lead to:
    *   Configuration changes.
    *   Data compromise.
    *   Taking control of the product.
    *   Launching attacks against the user's host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   An attacker sends a malicious SNMP trap to the Opsview server. The trap contains malicious JavaScript code within a trap variable.
    *   The Opsview software processes the trap and stores the malicious code as a trap exception.
    *   When an authenticated user navigates to the SNMP Trap Exceptions page, the stored code is executed in their browser.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   An attacker registers a host with a malicious SNMP agent.
    *   When an authenticated user performs an SNMP Walk operation against this host, the malicious code is included in the agent's response.
    *  The malicious code is executed within the user's browser as the SNMP Walk results are displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP traps to the Opsview server. This might require knowledge of the SNMP community string if access control is enforced on the snmptrapd process.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to register a host with the Opsview system and control the SNMP agent responses for that host.

**Additional Details:**
*   The stored XSS vulnerability occurs on the "/admin/snmptrapexception/list/unique" page
*   The reflected XSS vulnerability occurs during the SNMP walk operation on the "/admin/servicecheck/new" page
*   The vulnerability affects Opsview version 4.6.3.
*   The vendor released fixes in versions 4.5.4 and 4.6.4.
