{
  "CVE-2015-6772": {
    "Description": "The DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, does not prevent javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code that improperly interacts with a plugin.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the DOM implementation within Blink, specifically how it handles javascript: URL navigations during document detachment. The system fails to prevent these navigations while a document is being detached.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The core weakness is the lack of proper enforcement against javascript: URL navigations during the document detachment process. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation enables remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy. This could lead to unauthorized access to data or the ability to perform actions on behalf of the user within a different origin.",
    "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through specially crafted JavaScript code that interacts with a plugin in an improper way, triggering a javascript: URL navigation during document detachment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a specially crafted website that contains the malicious JavaScript code. The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. A network position allowing the attacker to serve the malicious page is necessary."
