Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the `vertica-udx-zygote` process in Hewlett-Packard Vertica. This process listens on a random port in the ephemeral range.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Command Execution:** The `vertica-udx-zygote` process accepts unauthenticated command packets. This means an attacker doesn't need any credentials to interact with the vulnerable process.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
*   **Privileged Context:** The arbitrary commands are executed under the context of `dbadmin`, a highly privileged user, which allows the attacker to gain substantial control over the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker gains control over the server with `dbadmin` privileges, potentially leading to data theft, system manipulation, or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based since the `vertica-udx-zygote` process is listening on a network port.
*   **Unauthenticated Command Packets:** The attacker sends crafted command packets to the vulnerable process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable Vertica instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Process:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `vertica-udx-zygote` process and the format of the vulnerable command packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   A patch or update has been issued by Hewlett-Packard to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific Digital Vaccine filter.
