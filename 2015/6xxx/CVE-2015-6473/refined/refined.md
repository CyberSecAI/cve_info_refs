Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of privilege separation in the WAGO IO PLC devices. All default user accounts (admin, user, guest) have full administrative privileges, regardless of their assigned user role.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:**  There is no distinction in access rights between the different user accounts. All accounts can manage the device via HTTP(S) with full privileges.
*   **Default Accounts with Full Access:** The affected devices come configured with multiple default accounts that have administrative access without any restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** Attackers can gain complete control over the PLC using any of the default accounts (admin, user, guest) due to the absence of privilege separation.
*   **Unauthorized Changes:** Attackers can perform any configuration changes or other actions on the device without any restrictions.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to the disruption of operations, alteration of processes, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the device's HTTP(S) web interface.
*   **Exploitation Method:** Attackers can use any of the default accounts' credentials to login and gain administrative access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device's web interface.
*   **Default Credentials:** The attacker must know or have access to one of the default credentials (e.g. admin/wago, user/user, guest/guest) for the relevant WAGO device model.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content details additional vulnerabilities in the same devices such as weak credential management (CVE-2015-6472) and insecure ftp configuration, however, these are separate from CVE-2015-6473.
*   The content gives a more in depth explanation than the official CVE description which only states that there is a "Missing Authorization" vulnerability.
