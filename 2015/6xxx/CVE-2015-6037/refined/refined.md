{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Office Web Apps Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of web requests leading to cross-site scripting (XSS)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. This could lead to unauthorized access to content, actions on behalf of the victim (e.g., changing permissions, deleting content), stealing sensitive information (e.g., browser cookies), and injecting malicious content into the victim's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email: Attacker sends an email with a specially crafted URL to a user of a targeted Office Web App site.",
      "Web-based: Attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted URL to the target Office Web App site. Compromised websites or those with user-provided content could also host such malicious URLs."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click the specially crafted URL. This can be done through social engineering in emails or instant messages.  The attacker needs no specific permissions other than the ability to send a crafted URL to a user who has access to an affected Office Web Apps server."
