Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6317

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-264):** The system does not properly restrict access to certain web resources, allowing low-privileged authenticated users to access pages intended for higher-privileged administrative users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A low-privileged authenticated remote attacker could gain unauthorized access to specific web resources, which should only be accessible to administrative users. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, modification of configurations, or other actions that the attacker is not authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privileged user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to authenticate to the Cisco ISE.
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco ISE instance.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) versions prior to 2.0.
*   **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in ISE versions 2.0 and later. A patch is also available for version 1.4.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base Score 6.3, Temporal Score 5.2 (CVSS v2)
*   **Exploitability:** Functional exploit code is available (E:F)
*   **Remediation Level:** Official fix is available (RL:OF)
*   **Report Confidence:** Confirmed (RC:C)
