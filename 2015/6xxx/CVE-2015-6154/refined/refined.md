Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-6154:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are vulnerable to memory corruption when handling objects in memory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Webpages:** An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability when accessed through Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content/ads to trigger the vulnerability.
*    **Email/Instant Messenger Enticement**: Attackers may attempt to convince users to view the malicious webpage via links in email or instant messenger messages, or through malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host/Compromise Web Content:** The attacker needs to host or compromise websites with specially crafted content to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website through various means such as phishing, social engineering, or by exploiting a compromised website. The user must browse to the malicious site in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows clients and **Moderate** for Windows servers.
*   The updates address the vulnerability by modifying how the browsers handle objects in memory.
*   No mitigating factors or workarounds have been identified by Microsoft for this specific vulnerability.
* The vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
