Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6128

**Root Cause:** Improper input validation by Windows before loading libraries. This allows an attacker to plant a malicious DLL which is then loaded by a vulnerable application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **DLL Planting:** The vulnerability is a DLL planting issue, where an attacker can place a malicious DLL (elsxt.dll in this specific instance) in the same directory as a document or application, and the application will load the attacker-controlled DLL instead of the legitimate one.
- **Insecure Library Loading:** The vulnerable applications load libraries from the current working directory, rather than a secure, pre-defined path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer privileges would be less impacted than admin users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted OLE Object in Microsoft Office:** By embedding a specially crafted OLE object with a modified CLSID that points to a vulnerable DLL (els.dll), an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the document is opened.
- **Specially Crafted RTF Document:** The exploit can also be triggered by opening a specially crafted RTF document that references the vulnerable CLSID.
- **User Interaction:** The attack can be triggered by single-clicking on the crafted OLE object embedded in the document, or automatically when the document is opened when using an RTF document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local system to place the malicious DLL (elsxt.dll) in the directory where the vulnerable document will be opened.
- **Ability to Execute a Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to have the ability to get the user to open the crafted document either by tricking the user or by other means.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit-db content provides a specific example using an OLE Packager object, where the CLSID is modified to point to `els.dll`.
- It also gives the specific vulnerable CLSIDs: `{394c052e-b830-11d0-9a86-00c04fd8dbf7}`, `{975797fc-4e2a-11d0-b702-00c04fd8dbf7}`, and `{f778c6b4-c08b-11d2-976c-00c04f79db19}`.
- A call stack leading up to the vulnerable `LoadLibraryW()` call is provided in the exploit-db article for els.dll.
- A proof-of-concept is also provided that contains a document with a crafted OLE object and the malicious `elsxt.dll` file needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The Exploit-DB entry clarifies that the vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction when using a specially crafted RTF document.

**Summary**

This vulnerability is a classic DLL planting attack that allows for remote code execution by exploiting insecure library loading practices in Windows applications.  The attacker needs to get the user to open a specially crafted document. By using OLE objects in Office documents or RTF documents, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to load a malicious DLL from the same directory as the document, giving the attacker code execution on the victim's machine.
