If you create a new folder in the iPython file browser and set
Javascript code as its name the code injected will be executed. So, if I
create a folder called "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> and
then I access to it, the cookies will be prompted.

The XSS code is also executed if you access a link pointing directly at
the folder.

# CVE Request : CSRF in IPython/Jupyter notebook Tree.

*From*: Matthias Bussonnier <bussonniermatthias () gmail com>

```

Email addresses of requester: security () ipython org; rgbkrk () gmail com; bussonniermatthias () gmail com; thebrowfc
() gmail com; jkamens () quantopian com

Software name: IPython notebook / Jupyter notebook

Type of vulnerability: CSRF

Attack outcome: Possible remote execution
Patches:
  3.x: `3ab41641cf6fce3860c73d5cf4645aa12e1e5892`
(<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/3ab41641cf6fce3860c73d5cf4645aa12e1e5892>)
  4.0.x: `dd9876381f0ef09873d8c5f6f2063269172331e3`
(<https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/dd9876381f0ef09873d8c5f6f2063269172331e3>)
  4.x: `35f32dd2da804d108a3a3585b69ec3295b2677ed`
(<https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/35f32dd2da804d108a3a3585b69ec3295b2677ed>)

Affected versions: 0.12 ≤ version ≤ 4.0

(Note, software change name between 3.x and 4.0)

Summary: Local folder name was used in HTML templates without escaping, allowing CSRF in said pages by carefully
crafting folder name and URL to access it.

URI with issues:

* GET /tree/**

Mitigations:

Start notebook server with the following flag:

--NotebookApp.jinja_environment_options='{"autoescape":True}'

Or set the following configuration option:

c.NotebookApp.jinja_environment_options = {"autoescape": True}

Upgrade to IPython/Jupyter notebook 4.0.5, 4.1 or 3.2.2 once available.
If using pip,

    pip install --upgrade `ipython[notebook]<4.0`  # for 3.2.2
    pip install --upgrade notebook # for 4.1

For conda:

    conda update conda
    conda update ipython 'ipython-notebook<4.0' # for 3.2.2
    conda update notebook # for 4.1 or 4.0.5

Vulnerability was found by Juan Broullón, and reported by Jonathan Kamens at Quantopian.

Thanks !

Reported to Quantopian by Juan Broullón <thebrowfc@gmail.com>...

If you create a new folder in the iPython file browser and set
Javascript code as its name the code injected will be executed. So, if I
create a folder called "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> and
then I access to it, the cookies will be prompted.

The XSS code is also executed if you access a link pointing directly at
the folder.
