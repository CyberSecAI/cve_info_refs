Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause stems from multiple design and implementation flaws in the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne software, particularly in how it handles user authentication, access control, and the storage of sensitive banking information. These flaws allow for the circumvention of security measures and unauthorized access to financial data and systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Hard-coded account for account management:**
    *   A static account ("ANCO" in initial versions) with a known password is used across all installations for account management. This account has elevated privileges to manage other user accounts and audit trails.
    *   Later versions change the account name and password per installation, but this information can be retrieved using another hardcoded account (same username/password for all installations).

2.  **Client-side access control and auditing:**
    *   Login verification, audit trail creation, and account locking are performed client-side. This means that by disrupting network traffic related to these functions, critical security features are bypassed.
    *   Account locking is handled client-side, and the server does not lock the accounts. User accounts are added to a "locked" table which the client checks. This table can be manipulated by the client, allowing users to delete their own lockouts.

3.  **Unprotected storage of private keys:**
    *   Private keys used for banking transactions are stored in plain text (or trivially protected) in the SQL database, accessible to all users, regardless of access control settings. This allows for bypassing control mechanisms and impersonating valid users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Financial fraud:** Attackers can use compromised banking keys to make unauthorized transactions and bypass bank security controls.
*   **Data modification:** Attackers can modify all records in the software, including transaction records and pending payments, leading to data corruption and fraudulent activities.
*   **Impersonation and account takeover:** Attackers can impersonate valid users to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Bypass of security measures:** Attackers can bypass client-side login verification, audit trails, and account locking mechanisms.
*   **Economic crimes:** The vulnerabilities enable "undetectable" economic crimes against user organizations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** Man-in-the-middle attacks on communications between the client and SQL server.
*   **Internal access:** Attackers with internal access to the SQL database, or through the application can obtain sensitive data.
*   **Replay attacks:** Attackers can reuse captured login messages to gain access to the banking server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** Ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or access to the internal network.
*   **Software access:** Ability to access the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne client application or SQL database.
*   **Technical skills:** Ability to analyze network traffic and manipulate data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report states that the vulnerabilities were initially reported in 2012 and demonstrated to the vendor and CERT-FI in 2014, yet were still not fully resolved as of the report date (July 2015).
*   The report mentions that at least one vulnerability has been partially fixed. However, it remains possible to duplicate user security keys, modify all records, and bypass access restrictions.
*   The affected software is used by at least 1,500 organizations in the Nordic and Baltic regions.
