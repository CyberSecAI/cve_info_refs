Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-6835:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content includes a changelog for PHP versions, explicitly mentioning "Fixed bug [#70219](http://bugs.php.net/70219) (Use after free vulnerability in session deserializer). (CVE-2015-6835)". This confirms the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error during session deserialization. This occurs because the session deserializer (`php_var_unserialize`) can free memory and then later attempt to access that same memory using references (R: or r:) within the crafted serialized data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary weakness is a use-after-free condition, where a memory location is accessed after it has been freed.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:**  The vulnerability lies in how PHP deserializes session data, which allows a malicious user to craft serialized strings that cause a use-after-free condition.
*  **Lack of Proper Validation:**  The session deserialization process does not properly validate the integrity of the provided serialized data, failing to detect the unsafe references and allowing the process to continue after an initial failure.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** The content mentions that a successful use-after-free attack can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution remotely. While this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided PoC, this is a common outcome of use-after-free vulnerabilities.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** It is implied that a DoS condition may be created through the same attack vector.
*   **Session Data Corruption:**  By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could corrupt or manipulate session data, potentially leading to application logic flaws or access control bypass.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is by providing a maliciously crafted serialized string to a PHP application that uses session deserialization. This string could contain references to freed memory that causes use-after-free.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted serialized data to the vulnerable PHP application. This implies some level of remote access, possibly through user-controlled input fields or other mechanisms that influence the data that gets passed to `session_decode()`.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the correct malicious serialized string.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the use-after-free vulnerability.
*   The content also presents various code patches targeted at fixing this vulnerability. These patches attempt to prevent use-after-free by adding checks or deallocating the zval as early as possible and throwing exceptions upon encountering corrupted serialized data.
*   The content details how the patch was refined to account for situations involving different levels of unserialization and use of Serializable::unserialize().
*   It further emphasizes that the session code should just bail out and not continue to decode rest of the session, since it is already broken.
*   The content discusses, specifically, the vulnerability and attempts to remediate it in PHP versions 5.4.44, 5.5.12, 5.5.29, 5.5.33, 5.5.35, 5.6.11, 5.6.13, and a more generic fix that was backported to 5.6. It is made clear that a correct fix to this vulnerability is difficult, and will introduce breaking changes to the session handler.

In summary, CVE-2015-6835 is a use-after-free vulnerability in PHP's session deserialization, allowing an attacker with control over session data to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service attack. The vulnerability is caused by the reuse of memory locations freed during session unserialization. The official patch attempts to mitigate this by deallocating the zval and by throwing an exception to abort the deserialization process, and by considering the situation where nested levels of unserialization are taking place. The provided patches showcase the difficulty in remediating this issue completely.
