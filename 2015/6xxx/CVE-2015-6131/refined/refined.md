{
  "CVE-2015-6131": {
    "Root cause": "Windows Media Center improperly handles certain resources in a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially leading to system control. Workstations are primarily at risk.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "User interaction is required. In a web-browsing scenario, a user would have to navigate to a compromised website that an attacker is using to host a malicious .mcl file.",
       "In an email attack scenario, an attacker would have to convince a user who is logged on to a vulnerable workstation to click a specially crafted link in an email."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious .mcl file and lure the victim into opening it, either through a compromised website or email."
