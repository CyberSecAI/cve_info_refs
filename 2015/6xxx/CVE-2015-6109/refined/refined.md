Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-6109:

**Vulnerability:** Windows Kernel Memory Information Disclosure Vulnerability

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Windows not properly initializing memory addresses. This flaw allows an attacker to potentially retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper memory initialization.
    *   Information disclosure that can facilitate a KASLR bypass.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve the base address of the kernel driver from a compromised process. This information can be used to bypass KASLR.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a valid account on the target system.
    *   The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
    *  The attacker needs to run a specifically crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was publicly disclosed, but not yet exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
* The bulletin also notes that a security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2015-6113) exists due to the Windows kernel failing to properly validate permissions and multiple other vulnerabilities are addressed in the same bulletin.
