Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to how Microsoft Silverlight fails to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling allows an attacker to more reliably predict pointer values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is an information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **ASLR Degradation:** The vulnerability weakens the effectiveness of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a security feature designed to prevent exploitation by randomizing memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass ASLR, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.
*   **Facilitation of Further Attacks:** While the ASLR bypass alone doesn't grant arbitrary code execution, it enables attackers to compromise a targeted system when used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack Scenario:** An attacker can host a website with specially crafted Silverlight content.
*   **Compromised Websites:**  Websites that host user-provided content (or advertisements) can be exploited if they contain specially crafted Silverlight content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Host a Website:** The attacker needs the ability to host a website or inject content into one.
*  **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious site, typically via a link in an email or instant message.
*   **Crafted Silverlight Content:** The attacker needs to create or inject malicious Silverlight content.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided text also includes information for CVE-2015-6114 and CVE-2015-6166.
* The update corrects memory handling to maintain the integrity of ASLR in Silverlight
* There are also workarounds provided to temporarily prevent Microsoft Silverlight from running, including disabling the plugin in Internet Explorer and Firefox, and by removing the configuration executable.
