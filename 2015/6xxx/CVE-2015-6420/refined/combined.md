## Apache Commons Collections Java library insecurely deserializes data

#### Vulnerability Note VU#576313

Original Release Date: 2015-11-13 | Last Revised: 2018-08-27

---

### Overview

The Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library is vulnerable to insecure deserialization of data, which may result in arbitrary code execution. Java applications that either directly use ACC, or contain ACC in their classpath, may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

### Description

| [**CWE-502**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data -** CVE-2015-6420  In January 2015, at AppSec California 2015, researchers [Gabriel Lawrence and Chris Frohoff](http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/) described how many Java applications and libraries using Java Object Serialization may be vulnerable to insecure deserialization of data, which may result in arbitrary code execution. Any Java library or application that utilizes this functionality incorrectly may be impacted by this vulnerability.In November 2015, [Stephen Breen of Foxglove Security](http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/) identified the [Apache Commons Collections](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/) (ACC) Java library as being vulnerable to insecure deserialization of data; specifically, the ACC InvokerTransformer class may allow arbitrary code execution when used to deserialize data from untrusted sources. According to the researcher, this issue affects several large projects that utilize ACC including WebSphere, JBoss, [Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2015-11-11), [WebLogic](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2015-4852-2763333.html?elq_mid=31793&sh=&cmid=WWSU12091612MPP001C179), and OpenNMS. Unify also reports that [OpenScape](https://networks.unify.com/security/advisories/OBSO-1511-01.pdf) software is affected. In addition, [Cisco](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20) has released an advisory for their products.Both [versions 3.2.1 and 4.0](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_commons_statement_to_widespread) of the Apache Commons Collections library have been identified as being vulnerable to this deserialization issue.The Apache Software Foundation has released a [statement](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_commons_statement_to_widespread) regarding this issue, which contains advice for mitigating the issue, as well as further references and links. A [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-580) tracker entry has been filed to track progress toward a full solution.Other libraries, such as Groovy and Spring, are currently being investigated for similar flaws. Lawrence and Frohoff's presentation describes how applications and libraries written in other languages, such as Python and Ruby, may also be vulnerable to the same type of issue. It is generally up to software designers to follow best practices for security when handling serialized data, no matter the programming language or library used. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A Java application or library with the Apache Commons Collections library in its classpath may be coerced into executing arbitrary Java functions or bytecode.While many applications do not actively use serialization or deserailization, they often rely on libraries that do. If a class uses deserialization on some input stream (either a file or socket), and an attacker can send malicious data down that stream, the attacker can cause the program to construct objects of any class on its classpath (whether it uses those classes or not). And some classes, such as those in the ACC automatically execute code based on attacker-supplied deserialization input.An application that neither uses deserialization, nor employs any libraries that use deserialization, would not be vulnerable to this problem. Such an application should also lack a plugin architecture, or any mechanism for loading code that might use deserialization. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a full solution to this problem, but you may consider the following:**Apply an update**Apache Commons Collections [version 3.2.2](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/download_collections.cgi) and [version 4.1](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/download_collections.cgi) has been released. These new releases mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the insecure functionality.**Developers need to re-architect their applications, and should be suspicious of deserialized data from untrusted sources**Developers will need to make further architectural changes to secure their applications before they can re-enable functionality in ACC version 3.2.2 and later. From Apache's statement:*However, to be clear: this is not the only known and especially not unknown useable gadget. So replacing your installations with a hardened version of Apache Commons Collections will not make your application resist this vulnerability.* Developers should in general be very suspicious of deserialized data from an untrusted source. For best practices, see the [CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27492407) guidelines for Serialization, especially rules [SER12-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER12-J.%2BPrevent%2Bdeserialization%2Bof%2Buntrusted%2Bclasses) and [SER13-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER13-J.%2BTreat%2Bdata%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bdeserialized%2Bas%2Bpotentially%2Bmalicious%2Bby%2Bdefault).**Use firewall rules or filesystem restrictions**System administrators may be able to mitigate this issue for some applications by restricting access to the network and/or filesystem. If an affected application, such as Jenkins, utilizes an open port accepting serialized objects, restricting access to the application may help mitigate the issue. |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  13 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2379675.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2379675.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

# [R1] Cisco Security Manager and Prime LMS Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

In late 2015, Cisco generated a [long list](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151209-java-deserialization) of products that *might* be vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks. The list was, and still is, broken down into three categories: **Under Investigation**, **Confirmed Affected**, and **Confirmed Not Affected**.

Due to the severity of these vulnerabilities Tenable began investigating as well. While investigating *Cisco Security Manager* researchers came upon this code in *SecretServiceServlet.class*:

```

public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException
{
    boolean debug = false;
    HttpSession session = request.getSession();
    String context = session.getId();
    if (debug)
    {
        System.out.println("SecretService: Context = " + context);
    }

    DataBlob blob = null;
    ServletInputStream sin;
    if ((sin = request.getInputStream()) != null)
    {
        try
        {
            ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(sin));
            blob = (DataBlob)ois.readObject();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            if (debug)
            {
                System.out.println("SecretService: Exception thrown deserializing data blob: " + e);
             }
        }
    }
}

```

This code handles HTTP POST requests to:

```

https://<target>/CSCOnm/servlet/com.cisco.nm.cmf.servlet.SecretServiceServlet

```

The above is a classic example of deserialization of untrusted data. The method loads the HTTP payload into an *ObjectInputStream* and executes *readObject()*. Because Apache Commons Collection 3.2 is on the classpath an unauthenticated remote attacker can gain execution using one of [ysoserial's](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) Commons Collections gadgets.

Interestingly, this exact same code and HTTP endpoint also exists in *Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution*. However, the LMS version we were analyzing had an ancient version of Commons Collections on the classpath. Making remote code execution impossible. Further investigation into LMS revealed that it exposes an RMI Registry that *does* have Apache Commons Collections 3.2 on the classpath. Therefore, we were able to [exploit](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/exploit/RMIRegistryExploit.java) LMS by a deserialization attack through the RMI registry.

Tenable immediately informed Cisco of these vulnerabilities.

### Solution

No solution exists for PMS. Cisco has elected not to patch this vulnerability.

Security Manager was patched in November, 2016

# [R1] Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

The Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal has a HTTP server running on TCP port 9443 if “Operations Console” is installed. From this website, under the “Device Management” menu, we can add/delete/edit Unified CVP Call Servers (among other types of servers) that need to be managed. Adding a second server hosted on the same LAN, and observing the two servers communicating across port 2099 shows the unencrypted communication between the servers was full of serialized Java objects (among other interesting things like the username "`wsadmin`" and the hash of `wsadmin`’s password). The servers communicate with each other using unauthenticated Java RMI. What does that mean for an attacker?

1. It is trivial to get remote code execution on either server using the unserialization of a Commons-Collections gadget as described in CVE-2015-6420. An attacker only needs to download ‘`ysoserial`’, build it, and execute it. Like so:

```

albino@lobster:~$ git clone https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial.git ./ysormi
albino@lobster:~$ cd ./ysormi
albino@lobster:~/ysormi$ mvn install
albino@lobster:~/ysormi$ cd target
albino@lobster:~/ysormi/target$ java -cp ysoserial-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT-all.jar ysoserial.RMIRegistryExploit 192.168.1.6 2099 CommonsCollections1 "cmd /C mkdir C:\test"

```

2. Not only is there an RMI server on TCP port 2099, but also on TCP port 10001 and 10002 (We believe a couple others are configurable as well). All of these RMI servers expose a variety of MBeans that an unauthenticated remote user can invoke. We only found two MBeans that we felt were interesting (ignoring basic information gathering):

a. `HotSpotDiagnostic` offers the function “`dumpHeap`” which allows the user to write a file anywhere on the system. Two caveats: the invoker doesn’t control the contents of the file and the invoker can’t overwrite anything, making this an annoyance or potentially a low-end DoS for filling up drive space.

b. `DiagnosticPortal` contains functions for stopping and starting a packet sniffer. The `pcap` gets written to the root log directory. Basically, a way to fill up drive space again, with no critical impact.

### Solution

Cisco has released Unified Customer Voice Portal version 11.5 which addresses this issue.

## TP-Link EAP Controller lacks RMI authentication and is vulnerable to deserialization attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#581311

Original Release Date: 2018-09-26 | Last Revised: 2018-11-08

---

### Overview

The TP-LINK EAP Controller is TP-LINK's software for remotely controlling wireless access point devices. EAP Controller for Linux lacks user authentication for RMI service commands, as well as utilizes an outdated vulnerable version of Apache commons-collections, which may allow an attacker to implement deserialization attacks and control the EAP Controller server.

### Description

| [**CWE-306**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function -** CVE-2018-5393EAP Controller for Linux utilizes a Java remote method invocation (RMI) service for remote control. The RMI interface does not require any authentication before use. Remote attackers can implement deserialization attacks through the RMI protocol. Successful attacks may allow a remote attacker to remotely control the target server and execute Java functions or bytecode.[**CWE-502**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data -** CVE-2015-6420 EAP Controller for Linux bundles a vulnerable version of Apache commons-collections v3.2.1 with the software, which appears to be the root cause of the vulnerability. Therefore, EAP Controller v2.5.3 and earlier are vulnerable to CVE-2015-6420 as documented in [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313).EAP Controller v2.5.3 and earlier for Linux are affected by both vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A Java application or library with the Apache Commons Collections library in its classpath may be coerced into executing arbitrary Java functions or bytecode. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The Omada Controller software v3.0.2 and later are not affected by this issue. Software download is available on the TP-Link [support](https://www.tp-link.com/en/support.html) website. If older software must be used, users can help mitigate and reduce risk by updating the vulnerable libraries does not necessarily eliminate the vulnerability in all scenarios, as described in As described in [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313). |
| --- |

| **Update Apache commons-collections**Affected users should update the system Apache commons-collections library to at least version 3.2.2 or 4.1. For details, please see [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313).**Update the JRE version of EAP**Affected users should also update the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by EAP to the latest available version. Recent versions of JRE have improved deserialization protection features. |

A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization.

[![logo](/frohoff/ysoserial/raw/master/ysoserial.png)](/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/ysoserial.png)

## Description

Originally released as part of AppSecCali 2015 Talk
["Marshalling Pickles: how deserializing objects will ruin your day"](https://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/)
with gadget chains for Apache Commons Collections (3.x and 4.x), Spring Beans/Core (4.x), and Groovy (2.3.x).
Later updated to include additional gadget chains for
[JRE <= 1.7u21](https://gist.github.com/frohoff/24af7913611f8406eaf3) and several other libraries.

**ysoserial** is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java
libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing **unsafe deserialization** of
objects. The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then
serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes
this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

It should be noted that the vulnerability lies in the application performing unsafe deserialization and NOT in having
gadgets on the classpath.

The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to an application on a targeted system that uses the ACC library. After the vulnerable library on the affected system deserializes the content, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system, which could be used to conduct further attacks.      On November 6, 2015, Foxglove Security Group published information about a remote code execution vulnerability that affects multiple releases of the ACC library. The report contains detailed proof-of-concept code for a number of applications, including WebSphere Application Server, JBoss, Jenkins, OpenNMS, and WebLogic. This is a remotely exploitable vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject any malicious code or execute any commands that exist on the server. A wide range of potential impacts includes allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information.      Object serialization is a technique that many programming languages use to convert an object into a sequence of bits for transfer purposes. Deserialization is a technique that reassembles those bits back to an object. This vulnerability occurs in Java object serialization for network transport and object deserialization on the receiving side.      Many applications accept serialized objects from the network without performing input validation checks before deserializing it. Crafted serialized objects can therefore lead to execution of arbitrary attacker code.      Although the problem itself is in the serialization and deserialization functionality of the Java programming language, the ACC library is known to be affected by this vulnerability. Any application or application framework could be vulnerable if it uses the ACC library and deserializes arbitrary, user-supplied Java serialized data.
