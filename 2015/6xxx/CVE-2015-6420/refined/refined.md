  "cveId": "CVE-2015-6420",
  "description": "Serialized-object interfaces in certain Cisco Collaboration and Social Media; Endpoint Clients and Client Software; Network Application, Service, and Acceleration; Network and Content Security Devices; Network Management and Provisioning; Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider; Unified Computing; Voice and Unified Communications Devices; Video, Streaming, TelePresence, and Transcoding Devices; Wireless; and Cisco Hosted Services products allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Java object, related to the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Insecure deserialization of Java objects using the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library. The vulnerability occurs because the affected products deserialize untrusted data without proper validation, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-502",
        "CWE-306"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "HTTP POST requests with crafted serialized Java objects",
        "Java RMI calls with crafted serialized Java objects"
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object. No special privileges are required."
    },
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of Java objects, particularly through the use of the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library which, when combined with other exploitable classes (gadget chains), allows for arbitrary code execution.",
     "weaknesses": [
         "CWE-502"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to gain remote control of affected servers by executing arbitrary Java bytecode or functions. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, system compromise, and potentially a full takeover of the affected systems.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted serialized objects via HTTP POST requests.",
         "Leveraging RMI services to exploit vulnerable deserialization points."
        ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted serialized Java objects to a vulnerable service. The attacker does not need to have credentials or prior access to the system."
    },
    {
      "rootCause": "The TP-Link EAP Controller software uses a vulnerable version of the Apache Commons Collections library, and lacks authentication for its RMI service.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-306",
        "CWE-502"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can gain remote code execution on the server by sending specially crafted serialized objects through the RMI interface, without any authentication required. This could allow complete control of the affected EAP Controller.",
      "attackVectors": [
         "Exploiting the unauthenticated RMI service to send malicious serialized objects"
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "A remote attacker needs to be able to send crafted serialized data to the RMI interface, no authentication is needed."
