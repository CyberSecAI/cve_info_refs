  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-6244",
    "description": "The dissect_zbee_secure function in epan/dissectors/packet-zbee-security.c in the ZigBee dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 improperly relies on length fields contained in packet data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.",
    "affected_components": [
      "ZigBee dissector in Wireshark"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The ZigBee dissector improperly relies on length fields within the packet data. When these length fields are crafted to be incorrect, a crash can be triggered.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Denial of service"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted ZigBee packet that exploits the improper length field validation, leading to a crash of the Wireshark application.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted ZigBee packet needs to be sent.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to craft and send network packets. They don't need authentication.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located within the `dissect_zbee_secure` function in the `packet-zbee-security.c` file. This was originally reported as bug 11389 in the old Wireshark bug tracker. The issue arises from how the dissector handles length fields within the ZigBee packets, making it vulnerable to malformed packets."
