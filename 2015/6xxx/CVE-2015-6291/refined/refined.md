Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA). Specifically, certain message filter rules, when triggered, can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when message filters use any of these rules: `body-contains`, `attachment-contains`, `every-attachment-contains`, `attachment-binary-contains`, `dictionary-match`, or `attachment-dictionary-match`.
- The affected filtering logic, when processing specific inputs matching the configured rules, leads to a resource exhaustion or failure that causes the ESA to become unavailable.
- The vulnerability is related to improper input handling or resource management within the filter processing logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit causes the ESA device to become unavailable, impacting email traffic processing. Specifically, the work queue fails to mount, indicating a severe disruption of service. This could block email delivery.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without the need for prior authentication.
- **Email-Based Attack:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted emails that trigger the vulnerable message filter rules on the ESA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send emails to an ESA.
- No special privileges or credentials are required as the attack can be triggered remotely and without authentication.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the existence of vulnerable filters.
