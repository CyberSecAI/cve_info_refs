    "description": "Cloudera Manager is designed to transmit certain diagnostic data (or \"bundles\") to Cloudera. These diagnostic bundles are used by the Cloudera support team to reproduce, debug, and address technical issues for our customers. Cloudera internally discovered a potential vulnerability in this feature, which could cause any sensitive data stored as \"advanced configuration snippets (ACS)\" (formerly called \"safety valves\") to be included in diagnostic bundles and transmitted to Cloudera.",
     "root_cause": "Cloudera Manager was not redacting sensitive data from diagnostic bundles before transmission to Cloudera.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inclusion of sensitive data in diagnostic support bundles."
    ],
    "impact": "Possible logging and transmission of sensitive data, including data stored in advanced configuration snippets.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when Cloudera Manager transmits diagnostic bundles to Cloudera.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities or positions are required for exploitation. This is an internal issue within the Cloudera system."
