The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-6092, which is a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

**CVE-2015-6092 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office handles objects in memory. Specifically, when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory, it leads to a memory corruption issue.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.

    *   **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker could send the malicious file to the user and convince the user to open it.
    *   **Web-Based Attack Scenario:** An attacker could host the malicious file on a website (or compromised website), then trick the user into visiting it and opening the file. The attacker would need to convince the user to click a link to this website.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file.
    *   The attacker needs to deliver the file to the victim via email or website.
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the file.
