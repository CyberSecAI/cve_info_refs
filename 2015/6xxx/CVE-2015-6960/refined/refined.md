The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the edx-platform, identified as CVE-2015-6960.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-submitted content, specifically within the "Teams" feature of the edx-platform. User-provided team names were not correctly escaped before being displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code could be injected into a team's name and persistently stored in the platform's database. This injected code would then execute in the browsers of other users who viewed the team name.
- Improper Output Encoding: The lack of proper escaping of user-provided data when rendering it on a web page was the core issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to a range of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking and account compromise
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Data theft

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via the "Teams" feature, specifically by crafting a malicious team name containing JavaScript.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious team name is displayed within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create a team within the edx-platform. No special privileges are needed.
- The attacker's malicious code will execute in the browsers of users who view the team listing, regardless of their privilege level.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was self-reported during an internal code review
- The fix involved correctly escaping Javascript in team names before displaying them.
- The specific commit fixing this vulnerability is referenced: `https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/commit/0f7898922051c8069258d35d5d280badcae61ee3`.
