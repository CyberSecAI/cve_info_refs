The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-6997, which is described in the security content of both iOS 9.1 and watchOS 2.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `kSecRevocationRequirePositiveResponse` flag was specified but not implemented. This flag is intended to ensure that revocation checking for certificates is successful, and a failure should not allow the trust evaluation to proceed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of implementation of the `kSecRevocationRequirePositiveResponse` flag within the Security component. This means that even if revocation checks fail, a trust evaluation could still be considered successful, leading to the acceptance of revoked certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make a revoked certificate appear valid. This can lead to various security issues, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and the bypassing of security measures that rely on valid certificates.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing a revoked certificate. If the trust evaluation is configured to require revocation checking, the system should reject the certificate; however, due to the missing implementation, it might be accepted as valid.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to provide or manipulate the certificate being evaluated. This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack or the ability to supply certificates directly to the affected system.
