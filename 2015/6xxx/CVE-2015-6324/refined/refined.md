Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6324

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the DHCPv6 relay feature of Cisco ASA software. Specifically, a crafted DHCPv6 packet can cause the device to reload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, specifically a system crash/reload.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of IPv6 traffic, DHCPv6 packets directed to the ASA interface with DHCPv6 relay enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a device reload, causing a denial of service. This impacts the availability of the ASA device and its security functions.
- The reload could cause interruptions in network connectivity, potentially affecting critical systems protected by the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to send malicious DHCPv6 packets.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the packets to an ASA interface where DHCPv6 relay is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 traffic towards the targeted ASA device.
- The attacker does not need specific credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA software when the DHCPv6 relay feature is enabled. This feature is not enabled by default.
*   The vulnerability affects various Cisco ASA products, including ASA 5500 series, 5500-X series, ASA services module, ASA 1000V, and ASAv.
*   The advisory provides details on how to check if the DHCPv6 relay feature is enabled (using the command `show running-config ipv6 dhcprelay`).
*   A reload of the ASA device with thread name `DHCPv6 Relay` may be an indicator of exploitation.
*   There are no workarounds available, disabling the DHCPv6 relay feature mitigates the vulnerability, but at the cost of the intended functionality.
*   Cisco released software updates to address this vulnerability.
