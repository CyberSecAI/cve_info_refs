Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-6251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a double free error within the `_gnutls_x509_dn_to_string()` function in the GnuTLS library. This function is responsible for converting a certificate's Distinguished Name (DN) into a string format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:**  The core issue is that under certain conditions when decoding a certificate, memory allocated for the DN is freed twice. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double free vulnerability leads to a crash of applications that utilize the vulnerable GnuTLS library. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Certificate:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially crafted X.509 certificate.
*   **Long Distinguished Names (DN):** The crafted certificate must contain very long Distinguished Name (DN) entries, which trigger the double free during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker does not require any local access.
*   **Certificate Generation:** The attacker needs the ability to generate a malicious X.509 certificate with long DN entries. This certificate can then be presented to a vulnerable system through any TLS connection.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable function, `_gnutls_x509_dn_to_string()`, was introduced in GnuTLS version 3.1.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in GnuTLS versions 3.4.4 and 3.3.17. The fix involves ensuring that the output string's data pointer is set to NULL on errors.

**Summary of the vulnerability**
The vulnerability occurs in the `_gnutls_x509_dn_to_string` function which is responsible for converting the DN of certificates to string format. If a crafted certificate with very long DN entries is processed by this function, then double free can occur leading to crash and denial of service.
