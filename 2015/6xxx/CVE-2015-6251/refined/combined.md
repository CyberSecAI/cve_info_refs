We consider this a potentially complex question. There are multiple
ways to think about a case in which a client or server bug has the
possible side effect of an algorithm choice that should not have
occurred. The perspective from which the CVE project thinks about
these cases is not necessarily the same as the perspective from which
a protocol designer, or a cryptographic-library author, would think
about these cases.

We think that the implied perspective here is "the actual security is
weaker than the intended security, and therefore the bug must be
categorized as a vulnerability in the cryptographic library."

An alternative perspective is:

  The issue does not cross any privilege boundary. Regardless of
  whether this bug exists, the server was already able to weaken
  security to any extent that it chose. The server could, for example,
  automatically publish the cleartext of all sessions to pastebin.com.
  The attacker role in the described scenario is a server operator who
  has intentionally decided to modify OpenSSL code to always sign with
  RSA-MD5. The server operator may, equivalently, have decided to use
  a non-OpenSSL product that is only capable of signing with RSA-MD5.
  Similarly, the server operator may have accidentally enabled a
  product configuration that signs with RSA-MD5 even though the server
  operator hadn't wanted that. In general, an observation that a
  server implements the TLS protocol does not mean that the client
  user is entitled to conclude anything about the ultimate
  confidentiality or integrity of any data supplied by the client
  user. The ultimate confidentiality and integrity depends, to a very
  large extent, on how the server site is operated and maintained. An
  especially concerned client user could choose to participate in TLS
  sessions only in cases where operations on the server side had
  passed a satisfactory third-party audit. Indeed there is a bug in the
  _gnutls_session_sign_algo_enabled function within the client code,
  but a bug cannot be categorized as a vulnerability unless it enables
  an attacker to accomplish a type/severity of impact that the
  attacker was not already able to accomplish.

The 007572.html message doesn't discuss an attack scenario for "GnuTLS
servers still accept RSA-MD5 in the ClientCertificateVerify" but we
think the alternative perspective may be similar. No privilege
boundary is crossed, because the client was already able to weaken
security to any extent that it chose, e.g., by publishing its client
certificate and the associated private key to pastebin.com.

Going back to the "all GnuTLS clients still accept RSA-MD5 in the
ServerKeyExchange" bug for the entire remainder of this message, it
may be possible to argue that the attacker role is not the server
operator, and instead the attacker role is a man in the middle. The
argument here is "because there might be server code somewhere with a
bug that causes an unintentional choice of RSA-MD5 for signing, the
client has a vulnerability unless the client is able to detect that
and refuse to let the session happen." In this scenario, the "server
code somewhere with a bug that causes an unintentional choice" issue
could have a CVE ID for that server-side vulnerability (i.e., if the
code is generally available rather than in-house code). Before
assigning a CVE ID for the client's _gnutls_session_sign_algo_enabled
bug, it may be reasonable to require that the "server code somewhere
with a bug that causes an unintentional choice" actually exists.

In other words, if the only known relevance of the
_gnutls_session_sign_algo_enabled bug is in situations where the
server has chosen to have weak security, then ultimately no privilege
boundary is crossed, and no CVE ID is needed. If the relevance of the
_gnutls_session_sign_algo_enabled bug is in an actual (not
hypothetical) situation where an in-the-wild server bug is causing
accidental RSA-MD5 signing, and the _gnutls_session_sign_algo_enabled
bug means that the intended client-side countermeasure is missing,
then a CVE ID is needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1251902#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-10 09:22:00 UTC  ``` A use-after-free flaw was found in GnuTLS's _gnutls_x509_dn_to_string() function. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted certificate with very long DistinguishedName (DN) entries that, when processed by an application compiled against GnuTLS, could cause that application to crash.  This issue was fixed in upstream versions 3.4.4 and 3.3.17 of GnuTLS:  <https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-devel/2015-August/007707.html> <https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-devel/2015-August/007708.html>  The following patch fixes this issue:  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/272854367efc130fbd4f1a51840d80c630214e12>  The affected function, _gnutls_x509_dn_to_string(), was first introduced in version 3.1.10 via commit:  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6be35136333b5d6289f23209cf896e741462909a>  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier include GnuTLS versions 2.x or 1.x and are therefore not affected by this issue.

## Advisories before 2018

| Tag | Other identifiers | Description | Information || GNUTLS-SA-2017-4 |  | Crash | It was found using the [TLS fuzzer](https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer) tools that decoding a status response TLS extension with valid contents could lead to a crash due to a null pointer dereference. The issue affects GnuTLS server applications. The issue was fixed in 3.5.13. **Recommendation:** To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.5.13 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-3 | [CVE-2017-7869](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7869) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted OpenPGP certificates could lead to (**A**) an integer overflow, resulting to an invalid memory write, (**B**) a null pointer dereference resulting to a server crash, and (**C**) a large allocation, resulting to a server out-of-memory condition. These affect only applications which utilize the OpenPGP certificate functionality of GnuTLS. The issues were fixed in 3.5.10. **Recommendation:** The support of OpenPGP certificates in GnuTLS [is considered obsolete](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/102). As such, it is not recommended to use OpenPGP certificates with GnuTLS. To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.5.10 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-2 | [CVE-2017-5335](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5335) [CVE-2017-5336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5336) [CVE-2017-5337](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5337) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted OpenPGP certificate could lead to heap and stack overflows. This affects only applications which utilize the OpenPGP certificate functionality of GnuTLS. This issue was fixed in GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8. **Recommendation:** The support of OpenPGP certificates in GnuTLS [is considered obsolete](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/102). As such, it is not recommended to use OpenPGP certificates with GnuTLS. To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.26, 3.5.8 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-1 | [CVE-2017-5334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5334) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted X.509 certificate with Proxy Certificate Information extension present could lead to a double free. This issue was fixed in GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.26, 3.5.8 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2016-3 | [CVE-2016-7444](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7444) | OCSP validation issue | Stefan BÃ¼hler discovered an issue that affects validation of certificates using OCSP responses, which can falsely report a certificate as valid under certain circumstances. That issue affects gnutls 3.3.24, 3.4.14, 3.5.3 and previous versions. [Write-up by Stefan BÃ¼hler](http://lists.gnutls.org/pipermail/gnutls-devel/2016-September/008146.html) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS versions 3.4.15, 3.5.4 or apply the patch referenced in the mail above. |

| GNUTLS-SA-2016-2 |  | Certificate verification issue | We discoverd a vulnerability that affects certificate verification when GnuTLS is used in combination with the p11-kit trust module. That issue affects gnutls 3.3.23, 3.4.12 and later versions.  **Who is affected by this vulnerability?**  * GnuTLS installations which are configured to utilize the p11-kit trust store (i.e., when compiled with --with-default-trust-store-pkcs11).  **How to mitigate the vulnerability?**  * Disable the trust store verification or upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.24, 3.4.14 and later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2016-1 | [CVE-2016-4456](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4456) | File overwrite by setuid programs | Setuid programs using GnuTLS 3.4.12 could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite and corrupt arbitrary files in the filesystem. This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12 with the GNUTLS\_KEYLOGFILE environment variable handling via getenv() and fixed in GnuTLS 3.4.13 by switching to secure\_getenv() where available. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-4 | [CVE-2015-3308](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3308) | Double free in CRL distribution points decoding of a certificate | Robert ÅwiÄcki reported that decoding a specially crafted certificate with certain CRL distribution points format can lead to a double free. This issue was fixed in GnuTLS 3.3.14. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.14, or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-3 | [CVE-2015-6251](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6251) | Double free in certificate DN decoding | Kurt Roeckx reported that decoding a specific certificate with very long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free, which may result to a denial of service. Since the DN decoding occurs in almost all applications using certificates it is recommended to upgrade the latest GnuTLS version fixing the issue. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-2 | [No CVE assigned](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/374) | ServerKeyExchange signature issue | [Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/8132) that a ServerKeyExchange signature sent by the server is not verified to be in the acceptable by the client set of algorithms. That has the effect of allowing MD5 signatures (which are disabled by default) in the ServerKeyExchange message. It is not believed that this bug can be exploited because a fraudulent signature has to be generated in real-time which is not known to be possible. However, since attacks can only get better it is recommended to update to a GnuTLS version which addresses the issue. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.1, or 3.3.15. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-1 | [CVE-2015-0282](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0282) | Signature forgery | This issue only affects versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.1.0 (released in 2012). These versions don't verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential downgrade to a disallowed algorithm, such as MD5, without detecting it. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.1.0, or later. A patch will be included in gnutls\_2\_12\_x branch for the users of that version that cannot upgrade. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-5 | [CVE-2014-8564](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8564) | Denial of service | Sean Burford reported that the encoding of elliptic curves parameters GnuTLS 3 is vulnerable to a denial of service (heap corruption). It affects clients and servers which print information about the peer's public key, e.g., the key ID, and can be exploited via a specially crafted X.509 certificate. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.10, 3.2.20 or 3.1.28. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-4 | [CVE-2014-3566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566) | Possible plaintext recovery | This is a vulnerability on the SSL 3.0 protocol (called POODLE), which can be exploited when TLS clients use a non-standard insecure protocol negotiation (it affects mostly browsers). Clients performing the standard TLS handshake as documented by GnuTLS are not affected. [Write-up by Nikos](http://nmav.gnutls.org/2014/10/what-about-poodle.html) **Recommendation:** For clients using the documented handshake process no action is required. Clients that use the non-standard insecure negotiation should not negotiate SSL 3.0. In all cases it recommended to disable SSL 3.0 using a priority string such as "NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0". |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-3 | [CVE-2014-3466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466) | Memory corruption | This vulnerability affects the client side of the gnutls library. A server that sends a specially crafted ServerHello could corrupt the memory of a requesting client. [Analysis at radare.today](http://radare.today/technical-analysis-of-the-gnutls-hello-vulnerability/) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest gnutls version (3.1.25, 3.2.15 or 3.3.4) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-2 | [CVE-2014-0092](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0092) | Certificate verification issue | A vulnerability was discovered that affects the certificate verification functions of all gnutls versions. A specially crafted certificate could bypass certificate validation checks. The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of GnuTLS for Red Hat.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Anyone using certificate authentication in any version of GnuTLS.  **How are past sessions affected?**  * The vulnerability to be exploited it requires an active man-in-the-middle attacker.   Past sessions are not affected unless they were under such an attack.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version ([3.2.12](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/7341) or 3.1.22), or   apply the patch for [GnuTLS 2.12.x](https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6aa26f78150ccbdf0aec1878a41c17c41d358a3b). |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-1 | [CVE-2014-1959](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1959) | Certificate verification issue | Suman Jana reported a vulnerability that affects the certificate verification functions of gnutls 2.11.5 and later versions. A version 1 intermediate certificate will be considered as a CA certificate by default (something that deviates from the documented behavior).  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Anyone who has a CA that issues X.509 version 1 certificates in his   trusted list.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Apply [this   patch](https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/b1abfe3d182d68539900092eb42fc62cf1bb7e7c) or upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version (3.2.11 or 3.1.21). |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-3 | [CVE-2013-4466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4466) | Denial of service | This vulnerability affects the DANE library of gnutls 3.1.x and gnutls 3.2.x. A server that returns more 4 DANE entries could corrupt the memory of a requesting client. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest gnutls version (3.1.16 or 3.2.6) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-2 | [CVE-2013-2116](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2116) | Denial of service | This vulnerability affects gnutls 2.12.23 and its TLS record decoding. **Recommendation:** Apply [the patch](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6754) or upgrade to gnutls 3.x. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-1 | [TLS CBC padding timing attack](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/) [CVE-2013-1619](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1619) | Possible plaintext recovery | Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson devised an attack that recovers some bits of the plaintext of a GnuTLS session that utilizes that CBC ciphersuites, by using timing information.  In order for the attack to work the client must operate as follows. It connects to a server, it sends some (encrypted) data that will be intercepted by the attacker, who will terminate the client's connection abnormally (i.e. the client will receive a premature termination error). The client should repeat that, multiple times.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Clients that repeatedly reconnect and transfer the same data, after   a TLS fatal error occurs.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Do not enable the CBC ciphersuites, prefer ARCFOUR or GCM modes. * Upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version (3.1.7, 3.0.28, or 2.12.23).  [Write-up by Nikos](http://nikmav.blogspot.be/2013/02/time-is-money-for-cbc-ciphersuites.html) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 | ["CRIME" attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/) [CVE-2012-4929](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4929) | Possible plaintext recovery | There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain circumstances.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Clients or servers that use compression and provide the ability to   an adversary to inject data (multiple times) in their session.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Do not enable compression (GnuTLS doesn't enable it by default) * When using compression use the CBC ciphers that include a random   padding up to 255 bytes. That would increase the number of trials an   attacker needs to perform significantly. Note that using compression provides [information to an attacker](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ecrypt/provpriv2012/abstracts/barghavan.pdf) on the plaintext.  [Security advisory](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6304)  [A description of the attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/)  [Another analysis of the attack](http://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2012/09/tls-crime-beast-and-you-programmer.html) |

Clients that perform session resumption using the same steps as in [the example code of GnuTLS documentation](http://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Client-with-Resume-capability-example.html#Client-with-Resume-capability-example) are not vulnerable. A preliminary analysis found no vulnerable clients. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.7 or 2.12.14. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2011-1 | [Rizzo attack on TLS](http://www.ekoparty.org/2011/juliano-rizzo.php) | Plaintext recovery | [Mailing list discussion](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2011-09/msg00064.html)  **Recommendation:** Make use of TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 protocols that are not vulnerable to the attack. TLS 1.1 is enabled by default in GnuTLS since version 2.0.0 (released in 2007). If this is not possible, disable CBC ciphers. |

Subject: CVE request: GNUTLS-SA-2015-3 double free in certificate DN decoding

Hi,

GnuTLS released versions 3.4.4 and 3.3.17 that fix one security issue:

<http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2015-3>

"Kurt Roeckx reported that decoding a specific certificate with very
long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free, which may
result to a denial of service. Since the DN decoding occurs in almost
all applications using certificates it is recommended to upgrade the
latest GnuTLS version fixing the issue. Recommendation: Upgrade to
GnuTLS 3.4.4, or 3.3.17."

The upstream patch that fixes this issue is available at:

<https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/272854367efc130fbd4f1a51840d80c630214e12>

Can a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Also, there is still no CVE for the issue before this one. The CVE
request was sent on May 5:

<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/367>

Can a CVE be assigned to this as well?

Thank you!

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3334-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : gnutls28
CVE ID         : not yet available
Debian Bug     : 795068

Kurt Roeckx discovered that decoding a specific certificate with very
long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw by creating a specially crafted
certificate that, when processed by an application compiled against
GnuTLS, could cause the application to crash resulting in a denial of
service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-6+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.
