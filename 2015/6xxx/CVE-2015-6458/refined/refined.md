Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability present in Moxa's SoftCMS software. Specifically, the application has a flaw in how it handles input, leading to a buffer copy operation without proper size checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120):** The software copies data to a buffer without validating the size of the input, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Application Crash:** Exploitation could also cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Medium Skill:** An attacker with a medium skill level would be able to develop and execute an exploit for this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the system running the vulnerable SoftCMS software.
