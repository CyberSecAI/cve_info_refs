Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-6086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `CDOMStringDataList::InitFromString` function within Microsoft Internet Explorer. This function improperly handles new line and white space characters which leads to out-of-bounds read. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read when `CDOMStringDataList::InitFromString` processes the document's data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `CDOMStringDataList::InitFromString`.
- Improper handling of newline and whitespace characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can read arbitrary memory, potentially leaking sensitive information.
- Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Bypass: By leaking the base address of `MSHTML.DLL`, an attacker can bypass ASLR, making further exploitation more reliable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by convincing a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
-  Specifically, the attacker needs to manipulate the document's elements to trigger the out-of-bounds read within `CDOMStringDataList::InitFromString`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page or have the user open a malicious file.
- The attacker needs to manipulate specific document elements to trigger the vulnerability
- User interaction is required to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer versions 9, 10 and 11.
- The exploit code included in the Exploit-DB content, demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and leak the base address of `MSHTML.DLL`.
- The exploit utilizes heap spraying with "MsGestureEvent" objects and creates holes in memory allocation to position vulnerable buffer adjacent to the sprayed memory chunks. The exploit also uses a trick to bypass allocation on OLEAUT32 Cached Heap and uses `requiredFeatures` property to trigger the OOB read.
- The exploit is unreliable due to dependence on specific heap layout, and the page may need to be reloaded to achieve the right heap layout for successful exploitation.
