Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the password recovery mechanism of CubeCart. The application fails to properly validate the "Validation Key" during the password reset process. Specifically, the SQL query used to check the key doesn't handle empty strings correctly, treating them as NULL, which allows password resets to be performed without a valid key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Password Reset:** The password reset process can be bypassed due to a flaw in SQL query construction.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the user-supplied "Validation Key," allowing an attacker to use a space which is then converted to an empty string.
*   **SQL Query Flaw:** The SQL query used to look up the user for password reset doesn't explicitly check for NULL values, causing an empty string to match with users who haven't requested a password reset and therefore have a NULL value in the 'verify' column.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Account Hijacking:** An attacker can reset the password of an administrator account if they know the email address.
*   **Complete Control Panel Access:** Gaining access to the admin account allows an attacker to take full control of the store's control panel, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of store settings, or malicious actions on the store.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/admin.php?_g=recovery` endpoint.
*   **Web Interface:** The attacker interacts with the password reset page, providing a space character as the validation key and knowing the admin's email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Admin Email:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the administrator account they wish to compromise.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target CubeCart instance.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about this specific vulnerability to exploit it successfully.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The password recovery page at `/admin.php?_g=recovery` requests a Validation Key, Email, and the new password.
2.  The validation key is stored in the `CubeCart_admin_users` table in the `verify` column (varchar(32)) after a reset email is sent.
3.  If a password reset email is not sent, the default value for this field is `NULL`.
4.  The vulnerability occurs in the `database.class.php` file.
5.  The `where()` function calls `sqlSafe()` which quotes the space character resulting in an empty string (' ').
6.  The SQL query `SELECT admin_id,username WHERE email='admin@email.com' AND verify = ' ';` interprets the empty string as `NULL`, thus bypassing the validation.
7.  The attacker sends the crafted POST request with an empty space (%20) in the "validate" field along with the admin email, a new password, and a valid token.

**Affected Versions:**

*   CubeCart versions 5.2.12 to 6.0.6 are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**

*   CubeCart versions 5.2.17 and 6.0.7 include the fix for this issue.
