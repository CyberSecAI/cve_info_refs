Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the web interface access authentication of the Cisco EPC3928 Wireless Residential Gateway. Specifically, the device does not properly authenticate web requests, allowing for the execution of a subset of commands without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication for certain web requests, allowing unauthenticated access to administrative commands.
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** Due to the authentication bypass, an attacker can execute commands on the device as an administrator without providing credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can remotely execute a subset of administrative commands on the affected device without authentication. The content does not explicitly specify which commands can be executed but states that a variety of attacks are possible when combined with other vulnerabilities
- The provided exploit-db content suggests this can be used to download and decode the boot configuration file, reconfigure the device to inject data, extract sensitive information such as Wi-Fi keys, or perform attacks on the home user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Network:** The attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated attacker over a network connection to the vulnerable device.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting specific HTTP requests to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco EPC3928 device.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoints to send unauthenticated requests to.
