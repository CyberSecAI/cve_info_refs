The provided content is related to CVE-2015-6028.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the Castle Rock Computing SNMPc product, specifically within the "sc" parameter of the `WrFreeFormText.asp` URL. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. This includes database password hashes, which could be used to further compromise the system or access other related systems using the same credentials. The attacker can gain access to sensitive information and potentially modify data within the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by injecting malicious SQL code into the `sc` parameter of a specific URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated as a regular user to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
