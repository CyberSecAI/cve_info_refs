Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6574

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the SNAP Lite component of SISCO's MMS-EASE and AX-S4 ICCP products. A specially crafted packet can cause the SNAP Lite component to consume all available CPU cycles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper resource management, specifically CPU cycles. A malicious packet can trigger the component to consume all available CPU, leading to a denial-of-service. This is classified as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.
- **Remote Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a malicious packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition. The communication stack becomes unresponsive, disrupting the normal operation of the affected system.
- **Loss of Availability:** The system becomes unavailable for further communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over a network by sending a crafted packet to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple platforms including RedHat Linux, Windows, AIX, Solaris x86 and Solaris SPARC.
- The affected products are used in industrial control systems, specifically in the energy/SCADA sectors.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Portcullis Computer Security, Ltd.
- Patches were released by SISCO to address the vulnerability.
- Siemens SIPROTEC 5 devices are also affected due to the inclusion of the vulnerable SISCO MMS-EASE component.
- Siemens recommends disabling IEC 61850 communications on the affected port and restricting access to port 102/tcp.
- It is noted that the version of SNAP Lite component is not generally referenced in technical support and versioning is based on the full product. This might be confusing as the original advisory was based on a specific version of the SNAP Lite component.
