Security Update Notification

Vulnerability Disclosure for CVE-2015-6574
26 April 2016

Background

While testing for a client, Portcullis Computer Security, Ltd. detected a vulnerability in SISCO’s MMS-EASE V11.2000 product
for RedHat Linux. SISCO was notified of the vulnerability on 29 July 2015 and determined that both MMS-EASE and AX-S4
ICCP products that contained the numeral “142” in the part number were impacted/affected. In January of 2016, Portcullis
posted a public disclosure of this vulnerability to its website. SISCO customers were notified of the vulnerability and
provided with a patch prior to that public disclosure. This notice is in response to that public disclosure.

Details of all corrections made to SISCO products are documented in the release notes that accompany the product.

Description

The vulnerability is a ‘remote denial of service’ where a specially-crafted packet would cause the SNAP Lite component of
the SISCO product (with or without the security extensions) to consume all CPU cycles that were available to it, thereby
making the communications stack unresponsive to further communications.

Mitigation and Risk

The only known mitigation is to update the affected software to the latest available version (see below). The risk associated
with this vulnerability can be reduced by ensuring that only trusted computers have access to the network by using VPN
technology to control access to the ICCP network.  For systems where unauthorized access to the ICCP network is
prevented through the use of up-to-date VPN technology, the risk of this vulnerability impacting system operation is low.

Notes on Products, Part Numbers and Versions

The MMS-EASE products affected are designated with a part number “MMS-SECURE-142-XXX-DEV” where the ‘XXX’
indicates the computing platform on which the product is designed to run as described in the table below. SISCO refers to
this product generically as the “MMS-EASE” development license. MMS-EASE is used to develop ICCP-TASE.2 products by a
variety of EMS/SCADA suppliers. These EMS/SCADA suppliers embed executable versions of the MMS-EASE product in their
own ICCP-TASE.2 products which are then distributed to end users. The executable versions of the products distributed to
end users are designated with part numbers matching the development license and ending in suffixes such as –EXE, –
EXEHB or –EXEADD. The prefix to the part numbers indicate if the executable license contains the security extensions
(“MMS-SECURE”) or if they do not (“MMS-EASE”).

Also affected is V6.0000 of the AX-S4 ICCP product that includes “142-095” in the part number.

The vulnerability is in a component of the MMS-EASE and AX-S4 ICCP products called “SNAP Lite”. This component is not
sold separately and its version number is not generally referred to in technical support transactions with SISCO. Version
numbers are based on the full product and SISCO does not publish individual component version numbers. This may cause
some confusion as the Portcullis advisory refers to a version number of the SNAP Lite component only.

Patch Versions

The following table identifies the part and version numbers of the products that have been patched to include a mitigation
for this vulnerability. Any product identified by the part number in the following table that is an earlier version than
indicated will need to be updated to address this vulnerability. SISCO products that do not match the part numbers shown

2015-6574/

For access to updates and patches for products that are purchased from other vendors that includes embedded versions of
SISCO software (part number suffixes of -EXE, -EXEHB or -EXEADD) affected users should contact that vendor directly.
Software patches from SISCO that are provided for a -DEV license cannot be directly applied to a system running a product
containing an -EXE, -EXEHB or -EXEADD product.

SISCO customers with -DEV or -PAK licenses to the products listed above with active support and maintenance should log
in to the SISCO support portal (https://portal.sisconet.com) to download available patches and access other technical
support services as needed.

SISCO customers with -DEV or -PAK licenses to the products listed above without active support and maintenance
products should contact the SISCO VAR from which they purchased their license (http://www.sisconet.com/partners) or
SISCO directly at support@sisconet.com.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable IEC 61850 communications on the affected port of the device
• Restrict access to port 102/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 5 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation
functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
