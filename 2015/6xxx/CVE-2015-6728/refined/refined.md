{
  "CVE-2015-6728": {
    "description": "The token comparison in ApiBase::getWatchlistUser() isn't constant time, so timing attack is theoretically possible.",
    "root_cause": "Non-constant time comparison of watchlist anti-CSRF tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability due to non-constant time comparison of tokens."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could modify a user's watchlist via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by exploiting the timing differences in token comparison.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Timing attacks by observing the time taken for token comparison operations.",
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to modify a user's watchlist."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the MediaWiki API and measure the response time. The attacker has to induce a legitimate user to make a forged request."
