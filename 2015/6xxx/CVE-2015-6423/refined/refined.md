Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls (DCERPC) Inspection feature of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The ASA incorrectly handles non-DCERPC traffic when DCERPC inspection is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the bypass of DCERPC inspection. The ASA allows non-DCERPC traffic to pass through even when it should be restricted to only DCERPC traffic on TCP port 135. This indicates an improper validation or filtering of traffic based on the configured inspection rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially bypass the intended security controls enforced by the DCERPC inspection feature. This could lead to:
    * **Confidentiality Impact:**  Potentially expose internal systems to unauthorized network traffic (as indicated by a Partial Confidentiality Impact in the CVSS score).
    * **Integrity Impact:**  Although not specifically indicated in CVSS, bypassed traffic could be malicious and potentially impact the integrity of the internal systems.
    * **Availability Impact:** Similarly, although not specifically indicated, malicious traffic could lead to denial-of-service issues and impact availability

**Attack Vectors:**
   * **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
   * **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the ASA or have prior authentication.
   * **Traffic Manipulation:** The attack involves sending traffic that is not DCERPC, which the ASA should block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   * **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
   * **Remote Position:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, from any point on the network.
   * **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the ASA.
   * **Traffic manipulation capability:** The attacker must be able to send non-DCERPC traffic.

**Additional details:**
The advisory states that the vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software releases 9.4.1 up to 9.5.1 and that there are no workarounds available. The CVSS score is 4.3 (base) and 3.6 (temporal). The exploitability is considered functional, and the remediation level is that an official fix is available.
