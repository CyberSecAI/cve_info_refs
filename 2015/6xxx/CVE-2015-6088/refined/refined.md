Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-6088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the failure of Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge to properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the ASLR security feature. This bypass allows an attacker to more reliably predict memory offsets of specific instructions within a call stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The direct impact is a bypass of the ASLR security feature.
- **Facilitation of Further Exploitation:** While the bypass alone doesn't allow arbitrary code execution, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution) to more reliably execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing:** The attack vector is through a malicious website. The user needs to be logged in and browsing to a site crafted by the attacker using an affected version of Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website that exploits the ASLR bypass.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit this malicious website using an affected browser.
- An attacker could use this in conjunction with another exploit to gain arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2015-6088 is a security feature bypass vulnerability related to ASLR not being properly implemented in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. This vulnerability doesn't directly enable code execution but makes it easier for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution vulnerabilities, by making memory addresses predictable.
