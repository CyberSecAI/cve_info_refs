Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Cisco WebEx Meetings for Android handles custom application permissions. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the custom application permissions handling for Cisco WebEx Meetings for Android.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of custom application permissions. This suggests a flaw in the logic or code that manages these permissions, which could be due to insufficient validation, incorrect implementation, or a bypass in the intended security mechanisms.
-  CWE-264 is mentioned, which refers to "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls." This indicates that the vulnerability is related to improper management of permissions, privileges, or access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can change platform-specific permissions of a custom application. This could lead to various negative consequences, such as allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources, compromise other applications, or cause harm to the system and user.
- The confidentiality impact is listed as "Partial (P)". This means there is a considerable informational disclosure, allowing access to some system files, but the attacker's control over what is obtained or the scope of loss is limited. The impact to integrity and availability is none.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack vector. The attacker doesn't need local access or authentication.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated, exploiting this vulnerability over the network.
- The attacker requires medium access complexity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Meetings for Android versions prior to 8.5.1.
- No workarounds are available.
- Functional exploit code is available.
- A complete vendor solution is available in version 8.5.1.
