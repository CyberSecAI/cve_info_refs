Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-6083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs in the handling of `CTableRow` objects within Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability occurs when a `CTableRow` object is freed but subsequently reused by manipulating document elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that a memory location associated with a `CTableRow` object is freed and then accessed again, leading to memory corruption and potentially exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user's process. This could enable the attacker to perform actions with the same permissions as the user, potentially taking full control of the system if the user has administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed through Internet Explorer.
- **Malicious files:** An attacker can embed malicious code in files, which then triggers the vulnerability when opened in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject the exploit code into compromised websites or sites that allow user-provided content, leading to the same result when a victim views the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page or file that manipulates document elements in a specific way to trigger the use-after-free condition within Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious page or file using social engineering, email, or other forms of communication.
- No user privileges or special system access is required beyond being able to serve or have the user open the malicious file/webpage.
