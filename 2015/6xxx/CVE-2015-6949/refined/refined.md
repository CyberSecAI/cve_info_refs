Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-6949

**Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the HTTP header parsing routine of the ASUS TM-AC1900 router's `httpd` service. The code fails to check the size of header values before copying them into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow when overly long header values are processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack buffer overflow:** Writing data past the boundary of a stack buffer.
*   **Insufficient input validation:** Lack of size checks on HTTP header values during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, which may be achieved via the local network or through the internet if the device is exposed.
*  **No authentication required**: No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
