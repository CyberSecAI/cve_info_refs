| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XE Software Network Address Translation Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20150923-iosxe  First Published: 2015 September 23 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCut96933](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCut96933)     CVE-2015-6282     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.1, Temporal 5.9](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2015-6282     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the processing of IPv4 packets that require Network Address Translation (NAT) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) services of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series, Cisco ISR 4300 Series, Cisco ISR 4400 Series, and Cisco Cloud Services 1000v Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing IPv4 packets that require NAT and MPLS services.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability. NAT and MPLS services are not enabled by default.      To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must be present in the configuration.       The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration: ```   asr1000#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat pool test 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254 netmask 255.255.255.0  ip nat outside source list 1 pool test   ``` If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output is not empty, NAT has been enabled on the Cisco IOS XE device.      To determine whether MPLS has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **mpls ip** commands must be present in at least one interface.      The **show running-config | include mpls ip** command can be used to determine whether MPLS is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1000#show running-config | include mpls ip mpls ip   ``` In addition, **mpls ip** configuration command must be present on the interface that has **ip nat outside** configured, and the **ip nat inside** configuration command must be present in the configuration of another interface. The **show running-config interface** command can be used to determine the following:   + Whether the **mpls ip** commandis present on the same interface as the  **ip nat outside** command in the configuration   + Whether the **ip nat inside** command is present in the configuration of another interfaceThe following example shows a vulnerable configuration: ```   asr1000# show running-config interface ! interface GigabitEthernet0/0  no shutdown  ip address 10.86.194.60 255.255.254.0  ip nat inside ! interface GigabitEthernet0/1  no shutdown  ip address 10.10.4.200 255.255.0.0  ip nat outside  mpls ip !   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco NX-OS Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the processing of IPv4 packets that require Network Address Translation (NAT) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) services of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series, Cisco ISR 4300 Series, Cisco ISR 4400 Series, and Cisco Cloud Services 1000v Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of IPv4 packets that require NAT and MPLS processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an IPv4 packet to be processed by a Cisco IOS XE device configured to perform NAT and MPLS services. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.      To exploit this vulnerability, an IPv4 packet must arrive on interface configured with the **ip nat inside** command and be destined for outbound processing on an interface configured with the **ip nat outside** and **mpls ip** commands.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCut96933](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCut96933) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6282.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |
