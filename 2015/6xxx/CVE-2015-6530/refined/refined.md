Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-6530:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the search functionality of the OpenText Secure MFT web application. Specifically, the input field for searching stored files does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing user cookies or other sensitive information
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the `querytext` parameter when accessing the `userdashboard.jsp` page.
- An authenticated attacker needs to manipulate a token and send this crafted URL to the victim.
- The malicious payload is reflected back in the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into accessing the malicious URL. This could be done through social engineering, phishing emails, or by posting the link on a forum.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenText Secure MFT versions 2013 before 2013 R3 P6 and 2014 before 2014 R2 P2.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `querytext` in `userdashboard.jsp`.
- The proof of concept (PoC) uses JavaScript code within the URL to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a medium severity score of 4.3 according to CVSS v2.
