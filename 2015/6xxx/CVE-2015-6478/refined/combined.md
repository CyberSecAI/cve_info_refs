## Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE TeeChart.ChartGrid.5 ActiveX Control ColWidths Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-580ZDI-CAN-2918

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-6478](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6478) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Unitronics](http://www.unitronics.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | VisiLogic OPLC IDE |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19856']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the ChartGrid object in TeeChart5.ocx. A call to the Colwidths modifier can cause a user-supplied value to be written to any address in user memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Unitronics has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE TChart.ITChart ActiveX Control RemoveSeries Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-578ZDI-CAN-2910

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-6478](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6478) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Unitronics](http://www.unitronics.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | VisiLogic OPLC IDE |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19815']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the TeeChart object in TeeChart5.ocx. The RemoveSeries method of the object takes a user-supplied integer as an index into an array of object pointers. The index is not checked for validity and this can cause arbitrary memory to be interpreted as an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Unitronics has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
