The provided content contains 5 different vulnerabilities, all with the same CVE ID: CVE-2015-6478. All of the vulnerabilities reside in the Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE, specifically within the TeeChart5.ocx ActiveX control. They all allow for remote code execution via user interaction.

**Vulnerability 1**
*   **Root Cause:** A call to the `ColWidths` modifier in the `ChartGrid` object allows a user-supplied value to be written to an arbitrary memory address.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking on user-supplied value, leading to arbitrary memory write.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution under the context of the process.
*   **Attack Vector:** User needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

**Vulnerability 2**
*   **Root Cause:** The `ChartLink` method of the `TeeCommander` object can cause arbitrary memory to be interpreted as an object.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of validation of memory address.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
*  **Attack Vector:** User needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

**Vulnerability 3**
*   **Root Cause:** The `RemoveSeries` method of the `TeeChart` object uses a user-supplied integer as an index into an array of object pointers without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking on user-supplied index, leading to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
*   **Attack Vector:** User needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

**Vulnerability 4**
*   **Root Cause:** The `ChartLink` accessor of the `TeePreviewer` object takes a user-supplied integer and interprets it as an address, which can cause arbitrary memory to be interpreted as an object.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of validation of memory address.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.
*   **Attack Vector:** User needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

**Vulnerability 5**
*   **Root Cause:** The `GridLink` modifier of the `ChartGridNavigator` object interprets a user-supplied integer as an object address and uses it in processing.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of validation of the user-supplied integer leading to arbitrary object address access.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution under the context of the process.
*   **Attack Vector:** User needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.
