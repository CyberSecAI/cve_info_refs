## CVE-2015-1768

- **Vulnerability:** Win32k Memory Corruption Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
- **Root Cause:** The Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32k.sys) fails to properly free memory.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker would first have to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.
- **Impact:** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code within the context of another user. If that other user has elevated rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Mitigating Factors:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
