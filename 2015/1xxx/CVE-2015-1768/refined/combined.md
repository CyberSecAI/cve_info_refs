## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3057839)

Published: June 9, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory and validates user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3057839](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3057839).

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1719

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles buffer elements under certain conditions, allowing an attacker to request the contents of specific memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then potentially read data that is not intended to be disclosed. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system. Workstations and servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage this.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to execute programs on the system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver validates memory addresses.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1720

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly frees an object in memory that an attacker could use to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would first have to log on to the system or convince a logged-on user to execute a specially crafted application. Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how certain objects are handled in memory.

## Win32k Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1721

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver due to insufficient validation of certain data passed from user mode. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the kernel-mode driver properly validates data passed from user mode.

## Multiple Microsoft Windows Kernel Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the Windows kernel-mode driver when it accesses an object in memory that has either not been correctly initialized or deleted. The vulnerabilities may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could gain elevated privileges on a targeted system.

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could acquire elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

## Multiple Win32k Memory Corruption Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver, [Win32k.sys](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx), fails to properly free memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code within the context of another user. If that other user has elevated rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
