Parameters such as sort_by, sort_order, items_view, dir, clipboard_task, clipboard_files, clipboard_src, and clipboard_dest in the POST body are vulnerable to XSS. The parameter sort_by can also be placed within the URL.",
    "information": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",

          "Improper Input Sanitization"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser, leading to Website Spoofing or Injection of malicious JavaScript code which could use attacking tools such as BeEF.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered when a user uploads a picture to a gallery. Specifically, the parameters are sent either via a POST request or GET request. An attacker can manipulate the vulnerable parameters to inject malicious JavaScript."
