##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware ESXi, Workstation, Player, and Fusion host privilege escalation vulnerability**

VMware ESXi, Workstation, Player and Fusion contain an arbitrary file write issue. Exploitation this issue may allow for privilege escalation on the host.

The vulnerability does not allow for privilege escalation from the guest Operating System to the host or vice-versa. This means that host memory can not be manipulated from the Guest Operating
System.

**Mitigation**

For ESXi to be affected, permissions must have been added to ESXi (or a vCenter Server managing it) for a virtual machine administrator role or greater.

VMware would like to thank Shanon Olsson for reporting this issue to us through JPCERT.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2014-8370 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

##### b. VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion Denial of Service vulnerability

VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion contain an input validation issue in the Host Guest File System (HGFS). This issue may allow for a Denial of Service of the Guest Operating system.

VMware would like to thank Peter Kamensky from Digital Security for  reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-1043 to this issue.

##### c. VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Player Denial of Service vulnerability

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Player contain an input validation issue in VMware Authorization process (vmware-authd). This issue may allow for a Denial of Service of the host. On VMware ESXi and on Workstation running on Linux the Denial of Service would be partial.

VMware would like to thank Dmitry Yudin @ret5et for reporting this issue to us through HP's Zero Day Initiative.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-1044 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
