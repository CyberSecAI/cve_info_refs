Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1366:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Authentication bypass**: The plugin fails to properly verify if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain functionalities.
*   **Arbitrary file upload:** The plugin doesn't validate the host in the provided download URL, which can allow attackers to upload malicious files, including PHP code, from arbitrary hosts.
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin does not properly sanitize certain input values that are later used in file operations, enabling an attacker to store files outside of the intended "download" folder.
*   **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin generates an author link using unsanitized user-supplied values, which can be exploited for XSS attacks.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication Checks:** The plugin lacks proper authentication checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin doesn't validate the host in the provided download URL, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary host.
*   **Path Traversal Vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directories.
*   **XSS Vulnerability**: The plugin doesn't sanitize user input used to generate links, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers can bypass authentication and access plugin features they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Attackers can upload and execute malicious PHP code on the server via arbitrary file upload.
*   **Arbitrary File Write**: Attackers can write files to arbitrary locations on the server due to path traversal.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin interface with specific parameters such as `pixabay_upload`, `image_url`, `image_user`, and `q`.
*   **Malicious URLs:** Attackers supply a malicious URL in the `image_url` parameter, pointing to a server they control, to upload malicious files.
*   **Path Traversal Strings:** Attackers include path traversal sequences (e.g., `xxx/../../../../../../mogwai`) within the `q` parameter to store files in arbitrary locations.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   **No Authentication Required for file upload:** The authentication bypass vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to exploit the file upload and path traversal issues.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can upload a PHP shell using the vulnerability.
*   The fix for the vulnerability is to update to version 2.4 of the plugin, which addresses the input sanitization and authentication issues.
*   The vulnerability is associated with other CVEs (CVE-2015-1376, CVE-2015-1375, CVE-2015-1365) due to multiple vulnerabilities being present in the same plugin.
