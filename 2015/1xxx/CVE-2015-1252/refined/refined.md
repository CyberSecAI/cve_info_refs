{
  "CVE-2015-1252": {
    "Description": "common/partial_circular_buffer.cc in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 does not properly handle wraps, which allows remote attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via vectors that trigger a write operation with a large amount of data, related to the PartialCircularBuffer::Write and PartialCircularBuffer::DoWrite functions.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of wraps in the PartialCircularBuffer class during write operations.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can bypass sandbox protection mechanisms or cause a denial of service due to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a large amount of data to a write operation, causing a buffer overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to trigger write operations in the PartialCircularBuffer class."
