Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1197:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `cpio` utility, when used with the `--no-absolute-filenames` option, incorrectly handles symbolic links during archive extraction. While the option is intended to restrict extraction to the current directory, it does not prevent following symlinks that point outside of it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to bypass the `--no-absolute-filenames` flag using symlinks. `cpio` extracts symlinks and then follows them when processing subsequent entries, allowing writes to locations outside the intended target directory.
*   **Insecure Default Behavior:** Unlike `tar`, `cpio` extracts files with absolute paths by default. The `--no-absolute-filenames` option is supposed to prevent this but is rendered ineffective by the symlink issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can craft a malicious `cpio` archive containing a symlink pointing to a sensitive location (e.g., `/tmp`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.config/autostart/`). When a user extracts this archive, the symlink is created, and subsequent files are written to the location the symlink points to, overwriting existing files or creating new files.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Overwriting sensitive files like `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` or `~/.bashrc` could lead to privilege escalation or remote code execution if the attacker can control the content being written.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) or Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** As mentioned in the Ubuntu USN, a separate memory handling issue when extracting archives with `cpio` exists and, if combined with a crafted archive, can cause a crash and possibly arbitrary code execution. However, this part is related to CVE-2016-2037 and not CVE-2015-1197.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Archives:** The primary attack vector involves distributing a specially crafted `cpio` archive that exploits the symlink vulnerability. This archive could be delivered via:
    *   Phishing attacks (email attachments)
    *   Compromised websites
    *   Other forms of social engineering

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Archive Creation:** Attackers need the ability to craft a malicious `cpio` archive that includes a symlink pointing to a target location and subsequent files to overwrite.
*   **User Interaction/Trust:**  Attackers require the target user to extract the malicious archive, either directly or through a vulnerable application that uses `cpio`.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user without requiring special privileges. The files overwritten are still bound by the user's file permissions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `cpio` versions up to and including 2.12.
*   A patch was implemented in `cpio` 2.13 to address this vulnerability. However, a "revert" patch in Debian re-introduced the issue in their version of `cpio` 2.13, affecting many other distributions using it.
*   The fix involves preventing the writing of files over symlinks unless the `--extract-over-symlinks` is explicitly used, thus preventing arbitrary overwriting.
*   GUI front-ends for archive management that rely on the command line `cpio` are also likely to be vulnerable.
