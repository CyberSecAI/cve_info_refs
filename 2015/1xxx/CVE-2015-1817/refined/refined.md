- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in musl libc's IPv6 address literal parsing code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control of the return address.
- **Attack vectors:** Calling `inet_pton` or `getaddrinfo` functions with `AF_INET6` or `AF_UNSPEC` and untrusted address strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious IPv6 address string to an application that uses the vulnerable `inet_pton` or `getaddrinfo` functions in musl libc.
