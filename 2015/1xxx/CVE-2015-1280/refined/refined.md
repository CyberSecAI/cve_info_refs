  "CVE-2015-1280": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Severity": "Important",
      "CVSSv2 Score": "7.5",
      "CVSSv2 Vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P",
      "Affected Product": "Google Chrome, Skia, openSUSE Leap, openSUSE Tumbleweed",
       "Fixed in": "Chromium before 44.0.2403.89, chromium >= 66.0.3359.170-lp150.1.1, chromium >= 83.0.4103.97-lp152.1.1, chromium >= 90.0.4430.212-bp153.1.1, chromium >= 101.0.4951.64-bp154.1.2, chromedriver >= 55.0.2883.75-3.1,  chromium >= 55.0.2883.75-3.1, ungoogled-chromium >= 113.0.5672.92-1.1, ungoogled-chromium-chromedriver >= 113.0.5672.92-1.1"

    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Memory corruption in Skia library.",
      "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in SkPictureShader.cpp where crafted serialized data can lead to memory corruption. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by providing crafted serialized data through a renderer process.",
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
      "Attack Vector": "The attack vector is network-based, using crafted serialized data, which is then processed by a renderer process.",
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to send crafted serialized data to a renderer process via the network."
