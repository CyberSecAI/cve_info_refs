Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper clickjacking protection in IBM Jazz Foundation, which underlies several IBM Rational products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core vulnerability is a clickjacking flaw. This means that the application does not properly prevent its interface from being loaded within a malicious page, allowing an attacker to overlay content and hijack user clicks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to hijack the clicking actions of a victim. By tricking a user into visiting a malicious website, the attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests that manipulate the victim's clicks on the legitimate application, potentially causing unintended actions. The impact of these actions would depend on the user's permissions and what they are tricked into doing.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is network-based. The attacker needs to persuade the victim to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker. This website will then load the vulnerable IBM application in a hidden iframe and use overlays to trick the user to click elements in the hidden application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs the following:
*   Ability to create and host a malicious website.
*   Ability to craft specific HTTP requests.
*   The victim must be a logged in user of the vulnerable application.

**Affected Products:**

The following IBM Rational products are affected:
*   Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM)
*   Rational Requirements Composer (RRC)
*   Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG)
*   Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM)
*   Rational Team Concert (RTC)
*   Rational Quality Manager (RQM)
*   Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM)
*   Rational Software Architect (RSA DM)
