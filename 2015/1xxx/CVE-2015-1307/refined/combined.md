KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================
Title: plasma-workspace: Network access from screen locker
Risk Rating: Low
CVE: CVE-2015-1307
Platforms: X11
Versions: plasma-workspace < 5.1.95
Author: Martin Gräßlin mgraesslin@kde.org
Date: 22 January 2015
Overview
========
Plasma's lock screen implementation uses Look and Feel packages
containing QtQuick source files to style the lock screen.
Look and Feel packages can be selected by the user using a system
settings module. A user could download a Look and Feel package and
install it locally.
The QtQuick view allows network interaction, thus a malicious Look
and Feel package could collect the user's passwords on all systems
it's installed to.
Similarly any application running under the given user could install a
different Look and Feel package to gain the user's password.
Impact
======
If a user downloaded and installed a Look and Feel package the user's
password might be sent to the author of the Look and Feel package.
Workaround
==========
Use one of the default provided Look and Feel packages.
Solution
========
For plasma-workspace upgrade to Plasma 5.1.95 or apply the following patch:

Credits
=======
Thanks to Martin Gräßlin for finding and fixing the issue.
