Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Plasma's lock screen implementation utilizes Look and Feel packages. These packages contain QtQuick source files, which can be modified or created by users.
- The QtQuick view used within these packages allows network interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Network Access:** The QtQuick view in Look and Feel packages can perform network requests, a capability that should be restricted within the context of a lock screen.
- **User-Installable Packages:** The system allows users to download and install custom Look and Feel packages, creating an attack vector.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There's no mechanism to prevent malicious code within a custom Look and Feel package from performing unauthorized actions, including network communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Theft:** A malicious Look and Feel package could send the user's password to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This would occur when the user enters their password on the lock screen.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The vulnerability could potentially be used to collect and transmit other data beyond just the password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Look and Feel Package:** An attacker could create and distribute a malicious Look and Feel package that, when installed, can eavesdrop on passwords and other sensitive data.
- **Local Compromise (Secondary Attack Vector):** An application running under the same user can also install a malicious Look and Feel package, gaining access to user credentials. This means an existing compromise of a user account could be used to escalate privileges and potentially access other accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Package Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a Look and Feel package with malicious QtQuick code.
- **Distribution:** The attacker needs to distribute this package to target users, either through direct download or other means.
- **Local access (for escalation):** If the attacker is already running code under the user's context, they can install a malicious theme and potentially steal passwords.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory specifies that this affects versions of `plasma-workspace` prior to 5.1.95.
*   The provided commit link (`http://commits.kde.org/plasma-workspace/0a9cea625dfcb068fb03a4deab7430b1c4ad8aa4`) gives more information, indicating that the fix involves disabling network access from the QQuickView in the lockscreen.
