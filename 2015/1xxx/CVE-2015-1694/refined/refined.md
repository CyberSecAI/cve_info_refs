Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1694:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption: Specifically, the improper memory access corrupts memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content can be added to compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content/ads.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to view the malicious content. This is done by:
    - Tricking users into clicking links in instant messages or emails.
    - Getting users to open email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content on a website.
- The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious attachment.
- No specific privileges on the target system are needed prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer from IE 6 to IE 11 on both client and server operating systems.
- Systems where Internet Explorer is frequently used, such as workstations and terminal servers, are at higher risk.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The document also mentions that EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate attacks.
