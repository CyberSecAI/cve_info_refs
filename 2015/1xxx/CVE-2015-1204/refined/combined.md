How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I installed this as an alternative to NewStatPress, which is no longer being maintained.Thank you for providing such a great plugin.SlimStat Analytics is an excellent plugin that is easy to use and has many functions, but I would like it to be even better if the widget could display page views (yesterday, today), etc.

Nice data and super lightweight on site. Good for seeing clickthru data. I also use Postview. The only downside to the plugin is I run my servers at WP Engine and they still call out the CVE related to 5.0.9 which was shortcode. That was fixed two iterations ago but WPE still considers it unfixed. Getting their engineering team to review it has been a month with no progress. That also says something about the security database at WPE for that matter (ie out of date?).

What was the point to remove colors in the first place?
Thank you.

Thanks for this plugin! I really enjoy using the real-time user data. It also helps to find out about 404 errors/links on the site. You are doing great 🙂

I want a real time stats of active users on various pages of my site. But the real time page simply lists the current users and there is a map showing their location. Also, there are setting for date range??? This page could be configured better. Include setting as to what qualifies a active user (such as entered page within the last 15 minutes). Some information presented is useful. Also, stats regarding performance taxing on server would be good. But as it is, I don’t think I will keep this over GA4.
