| ***Product*** | ***VRMF*** | ***APAR*** | ***Remediation/First Fix*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager - 6.2.2-TIV-TFIM-FP0015* | *6.2.2* | *IV74198* | [*6.2.2-TIV-TFIM-FP0015*](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Tivoli+Federated+Identity+Manager&release=6.2.2&platform=All&function=all) |
| *IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager - 6.2.1-TIV-TFIM-FP0008* | *6.2.1* | *IV74199* | [*6.2.1-TIV-TFIM-FP0009*](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Tivoli+Federated+Identity+Manager&release=6.2.1&platform=All&function=all) |
| *IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager - 6.2.0-TIV-TFIM-FP0017* | *6.2.0* | *IV74200* | [*6.2.0-TIV-TFIM-FP0017*](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Tivoli+Federated+Identity+Manager&release=6.2.0&platform=All&function=all) |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

To remediate this, add the following macros to the list of comma-separated tokens in the runtime custom property [SPS.PageFactory.HtmlEscapedTokens](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZSXU_6.2.2.7/com.ibm.tivoli.fim.doc_6227/config/reference/CustomPropsSPS.html). Add these macros so that their values are HTML-escaped in the template files.

· @ERROR\_DESCRIPTION@

· @TOKEN:RelayState@

The value of the runtime custom property [SPS.PageFactory.HtmlEscapedTokens](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZSXU_6.2.2.7/com.ibm.tivoli.fim.doc_6227/config/reference/CustomPropsSPS.html) with the above macros added can be:

@REQ\_ADDR@,@DETAIL@,@EXCEPTION\_STACK@,@EXCEPTION\_MSG@,@RESPONSE@,@TARGET@,@DETAIL@,@SAMLSTATUS@,@ERROR\_DESCRIPTION@,@TOKEN:RelayState

NOTE: Other macros that are prone to cross site scripting vulnerability can also be added to [SPS.PageFactory.HtmlEscapedTokens](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZSXU_6.2.2.7/com.ibm.tivoli.fim.doc_6227/config/reference/CustomPropsSPS.html). The value of this runtime custom property will be revised periodically and update as needed. For more information regarding the runtime custom property, access <http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZSXU_6.2.2.7/com.ibm.tivoli.fim.doc_6227/config/reference/CustomPropsSPS.html>.
