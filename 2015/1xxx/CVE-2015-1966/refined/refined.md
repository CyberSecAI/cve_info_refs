- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input not being properly validated. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the use of macros like `@ERROR_DESCRIPTION@` and `@TOKEN:RelayState@` in templates, which can be manipulated if not properly sanitized before being rendered in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to influence the input processed by the application. The specific method isn't detailed but the vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests that contain malicious scripts within the vulnerable macros.
