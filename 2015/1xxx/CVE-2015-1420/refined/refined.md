Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `handle_to_path` function within the Linux kernel's `fs/fhandle.c` file. This function is responsible for converting a file handle to a file path. The race condition arises because the function reads the file handle size from user memory *twice*: once to determine the number of extra bytes, and again to actually fetch the entire handle structure. If the user-supplied size value changes between these two reads, an inconsistent view of the file handle can occur within the kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition due to the double read of the file handle size from user space.
- **Inconsistent State:** The race can lead to the kernel operating with an inconsistent size value for the handle, causing reads of additional (unintended) memory.
- **Lack of Proper Validation:**  The kernel doesn't adequately validate the handle size value after the initial read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to trigger read operations on memory locations beyond the intended file handle structure, which might contain sensitive information.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although not directly specified, some sources mention a potential for privilege escalation, likely due to the ability to read kernel memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause crashes

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local User Access:** The primary attack vector is through a local, unprivileged user.
- **Manipulating file handle size:** Attackers need to manipulate the `handle_bytes` value in the file handle between the two kernel reads

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Capability:** In some cases, the attacker might need CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability to trigger this flaw with `open_by_handle_at()` (as seen in the ubuntu description). However other descriptions only specify local users.
- **Crafted application:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted application that exploits this race condition.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability exists because the kernel fails to treat user-provided arguments as mutable and, consequently, assumes they remain consistent during execution.
- The fix involves reading the size of the file handle once and using that value consistently to perform memory copies, preventing the race condition.
- Patches for this vulnerability have been included in various Linux distributions (SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora) as well as specific versions of the linux kernel.
