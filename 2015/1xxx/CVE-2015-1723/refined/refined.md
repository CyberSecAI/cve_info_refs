Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the Windows kernel-mode driver, specifically related to how it handles Window Station objects. The driver improperly frees an object in memory, which can then be accessed after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free (UAF): The core issue is that the kernel attempts to access a Window Station object after it has been freed from memory. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service and execution of arbitrary code in the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This means they can gain full control over the system, including the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- Denial of Service: The exploit-db entry indicates that this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to execute code on the system.
- Specially Crafted Application: The attacker must be able to run a specially crafted application that triggers the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid Logon Credentials: The attacker must be able to log on locally to the system.
- Ability to Execute Code: The attacker needs the ability to run code, including a specially crafted program.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a proof of concept for the vulnerability, targetting Windows 7 32-bit systems.
- The PoC needs to be compiled in release mode.
- The crash may not trigger consistently and may need to be run multiple times.

**Summary**
CVE-2015-1723 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Windows kernel that can lead to elevation of privilege, and potentially denial of service. An attacker needs to have local access and the ability to execute code to exploit this vulnerability.
