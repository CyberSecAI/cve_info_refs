The content is related to CVE-2015-1704.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Elevation of privilege vulnerability due to improper permission validation in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. By itself, this does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, this could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) to run arbitrary code at a medium integrity level, gaining the permissions of the current user.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability, or compromise existing websites. The user needs to be convinced to visit the malicious website, for example by clicking a link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to host or compromise a website that can deliver the exploit, and convince the user to visit the website while using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
