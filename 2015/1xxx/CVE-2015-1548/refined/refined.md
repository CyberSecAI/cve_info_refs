Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect size calculation within the `add_headers` function of `mini_httpd`. Specifically, it's due to how the return value of the `snprintf` function is handled.
- `snprintf` returns the number of bytes needed if the buffer isn't big enough, not the actual bytes written. `mini_httpd` uses this as a length parameter, causing it to read memory beyond the buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose parts of the process's memory. This is caused by the `add_to_response` function using the potentially incorrect length from `snprintf`, which then leads to reading memory outside of the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive information residing in the server's memory space, which can include configuration data, other process data, or potentially even credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long protocol string. This can be achieved using `ncat` or similar tools.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the mini_httpd web server. No prior authentication or specialized knowledge is required beyond crafting the malicious HTTP request.
- The attacker can be on the same network as the vulnerable server, or potentially from the internet if the server is exposed.
