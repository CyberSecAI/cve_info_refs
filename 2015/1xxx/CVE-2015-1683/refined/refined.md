The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-1683.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory corruption vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send a specially crafted file to a user via email and convince them to open it.
- An attacker could host a website, or leverage a compromised website, containing a specially crafted file that exploits the vulnerability. Users would need to be convinced to visit the website and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted file that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The attacker would need to be able to deliver the malicious file to the target user, either via email or through a website.
