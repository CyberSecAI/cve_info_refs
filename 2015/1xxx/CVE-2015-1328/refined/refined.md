Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-1328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `overlayfs` implementation within the Linux kernel. The vulnerability occurs due to inadequate permission checks during file creation within the upper filesystem directory of an overlayfs mount. Specifically, when copying up a file from the lower to the upper layer, the code does not verify if the user triggering the operation has the necessary write permissions on the upper directory. Instead, it only checks if the owner of the file being modified has write permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is the insufficient permission checks in `ovl_copy_up_*` functions, specifically in `fs/overlayfs/super.c`. These functions fail to verify if the user has permission to create new files in the upper directory.
- **Metadata Copying:**  When copying files from the lower layer to the upper layer, the file metadata, including ownership, is copied verbatim instead of changing attributes like owner to the user who triggered the operation. This allows an unprivileged user to create copies of root-owned files.
- **Unprivileged Mounts in User Namespaces:** The vulnerability is exploitable in kernels with `CONFIG_USER_NS=y` and where overlayfs has the `FS_USERNS_MOUNT` flag set which permits mounting overlayfs within unprivileged mount namespaces. This allows a local user to perform the mount without requiring root capabilities in the initial namespace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. This is achieved by:
    1. Copying a root-owned file (e.g., `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/ld.so.preload`).
    2. Manipulating permissions on that copied file through overlayfs.
    3. Placing the manipulated file in a privileged location (e.g.,`/etc` itself).
    4. Using that file (eg: `/etc/ld.so.preload`) to execute code with elevated privileges.

- **Arbitrary Directory Listing:** It's also possible to bypass permission checks to list the contents of any directory on the system, regardless of permissions, by mounting a lower layer pointing to the target directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have shell access to the vulnerable system.
- **Overlayfs Mounting:** Exploitation involves creating a user namespace and mounting an overlayfs filesystem, then manipulating files within that mount.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the target system.
- **Ability to create User Namespaces:**  The attacker must be able to create user namespaces.
- **Exploit Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute custom code (e.g., the provided ofs.c exploit).

**Additional Technical Details and Notes:**

- The vulnerability is primarily present in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions with similar configurations allowing unprivileged overlayfs mounts in user namespaces. Debian, for example, restricts overlayfs mounts to privileged users by default, thus is not affected by the core of the vulnerability.
- The `workdir=` option for overlayfs mounts might be needed on newer kernel versions for successful exploitation.
- The `FS_USERNS_MOUNT` flag allows the mounting of overlayfs inside unprivileged mount namespaces which is a requirement for the exploit.
- The exploit demonstrated creates a world-writable `/etc/ld.so.preload` file, which can then be abused to gain a root shell when the system tries to load a dynamic library.
- It can also lead to information disclosure where a local user can list contents of directories like `/root` which they would not normally be able to view.
