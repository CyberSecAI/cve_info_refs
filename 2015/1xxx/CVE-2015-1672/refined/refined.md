- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework's XML decryption process. Specifically, when the .NET Framework attempts to decrypt certain specially crafted XML data, it can lead to processing recursion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specially crafted XML data during decryption. This leads to excessive processing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted XML data to a .NET application, which leads to processing recursion and degrades the performance of .NET-enabled websites or disrupts the availability of applications that use the framework.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted XML data to a .NET application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted XML data to a vulnerable .NET application. No authentication is required.
