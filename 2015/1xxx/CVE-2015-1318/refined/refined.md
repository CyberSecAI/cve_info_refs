```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Apport crash reporting feature, introduced in Ubuntu 14.04, forwards crashes to another Apport instance running within the crashed task's namespace. The vulnerability arises because Apport, when triggered as a coredump handler, executes with root privileges, regardless of the crashed task's owner or namespace. This allows an unprivileged user to craft a specific file system structure, pivot_root to it, and then crash a process, causing the privileged Apport to execute a script inside the crafted environment.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Lack of privilege dropping: Apport does not drop privileges before executing a script within a crafted namespace.
    - Insecure chroot execution: Apport uses chroot to enter the crafted namespace, but it doesn't sanitize the environment or ensure proper isolation.
    - Vulnerable crash forwarding mechanism: The crash forwarding mechanism naively checks for the presence of `/usr/share/apport/apport` in the task's root directory without proper validation, making it susceptible to crafted file systems.
  - Impact of exploitation: A local unprivileged user can gain root privileges, allowing them to access any file on the host system.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Crafting a malicious filesystem structure: An attacker creates a directory with a specific structure, including a malicious `/usr/share/apport/apport` script.
    - Using pivot_root to enter the crafted filesystem: The attacker uses pivot_root to make the crafted directory the root filesystem.
    - Triggering a crash: The attacker crashes a process within the crafted namespace, triggering Apport to execute the malicious script with root privileges.
    - Bind-mounting `/proc`: The attacker bind-mounts /proc from the host into the namespace to access host files.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Local access to the system.
    - Ability to create file system structures.
    - Ability to trigger process crashes within a namespace.
