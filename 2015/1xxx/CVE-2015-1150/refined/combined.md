## OS X Server v4.1

* **Dovecot**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10 or later

  Impact: An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL

  Description: There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL 3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling SSL 3.0 support in Dovecot.
