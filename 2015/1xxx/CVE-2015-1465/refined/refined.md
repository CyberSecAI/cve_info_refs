  "CVE-2015-1465": {
    "description": "The (1) pipe_read and (2) pipe_write implementations in fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16 do not properly consider the side effects of failed __copy_to_user_inatomic and __copy_from_user_inatomic calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application, aka an \"I/O vector array overrun.\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of side effects when __copy_to_user_inatomic and __copy_from_user_inatomic calls fail within the pipe_read and pipe_write implementations in fs/pipe.c.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of error conditions in copy operations",
        "Lack of proper validation of user-provided data in I/O operations"
      ],
      "impact": "A local user can trigger a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain elevated privileges via a crafted application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation through a crafted application"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a specifically crafted application on the local system."
