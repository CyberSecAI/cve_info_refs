- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability lies in the processing of opcode 1331 within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server, specifically how it handles the lza32 command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability. The software does not properly sanitize input when processing opcode 1331, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary commands via a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server with SYSTEM privileges. This could allow for complete control over the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted packet to TCP port 11460. No authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the affected server on TCP port 11460. No prior authentication or local access is required.
