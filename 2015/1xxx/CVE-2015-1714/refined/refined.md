- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user, potentially allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website or take advantage of compromised websites, convincing a user to view the website or open a malicious attachment via email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one, or send emails with malicious attachments, and convince a user to visit the site or open the attachment using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
