```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The CMS user details section is vulnerable to XSS. Specifically, the "Real Name" field on the user settings page is not properly sanitized, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user settings page, which could then be executed in the browser of any user who views the page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the website.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the user settings page, specifically the "Real Name" field.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have an account on the e107 CMS and access to the user settings page to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to modify the "Real Name" field, which is typically accessible to authenticated users.
