Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs when Internet Explorer improperly processes HTML option elements placed inside datalist elements. By manipulating document elements, an attacker can force a `COptionElement` object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The core issue is that memory allocated for a `COptionElement` is freed, but a pointer to it is still held and subsequently used, potentially leading to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.
- Improper handling of HTML elements: The vulnerability is triggered by the way Internet Explorer handles specific HTML elements (`option` within `datalist`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Potential for full system compromise: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system, including installing programs, modifying or deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- Privilege Escalation: Although not the primary impact, the vulnerability can be combined with elevation of privilege vulnerabilities to gain higher access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: Attackers can host a malicious website designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised sites or sites that host user-provided content.
- Malicious files: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking users into opening a malicious HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious HTML content: The attacker needs a platform to deliver the exploit, whether it's a malicious website, a compromised legitimate site, or through a malicious file.
- User interaction is required: The target user must visit the attacker-controlled page or open the malicious file for the exploit to succeed.
- No special network position is required: The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim; the attack can occur over the internet.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, the fix prevents the use of a `COptionElement` object after its memory has been released.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The ZDI advisory provides a specific filter ID `19727` for Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers to protect against this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2015-1755 is a serious vulnerability that could enable attackers to take over a victim's machine by exploiting a use-after-free condition in Internet Explorer's HTML processing.
