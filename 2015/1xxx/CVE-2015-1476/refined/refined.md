Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries. This occurs in two main areas:
    *   `product.php`: The `productbycat` GET parameter is directly injected into an SQL query without sanitization.
    *   `index.php` (admin login): The `username` and `password` POST parameters are directly injected into an SQL query within the admin login functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** This is the primary vulnerability. It exists due to a lack of input sanitization in multiple locations, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The SQL injection vulnerability in the admin login form allows attackers to bypass authentication by injecting a crafted SQL query that always returns a true condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Through the SQL injection in `product.php`, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data from the database or manipulate existing data.
*   **Complete System Compromise (potentially):** With admin authentication bypassed, attackers could gain administrative access, leading to full control of the application, and potentially the server.
*   **Denial of Service (potentially):** An attacker could use SQL injection to craft malicious queries that could cripple the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** For the `product.php` vulnerability, the attack vector is a crafted GET request to `product.php` with a malicious `productbycat` parameter.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** For the admin login vulnerability, the attack vector is a crafted POST request to the admin login page (`index.php` under `__admin`) with malicious `username` and `password` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability in `product.php`.
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit the admin authentication bypass, other than access to the admin login page.

**Additional Information**

* The exploit details a vulnerable code snippet from `product.php` showing the direct concatenation of the `$_GET['productbycat']` parameter into an SQL query.
* It also provides vulnerable code from `index.php` in the `__admin` directory demonstrating how the `$_POST` parameters are used directly in an SQL query without sanitization.
* The exploit provides Proof-of-Concept (POC) URLs/steps to demonstrate both vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerable application is `ecommercemajor`, a PHP-based e-commerce CMS.
