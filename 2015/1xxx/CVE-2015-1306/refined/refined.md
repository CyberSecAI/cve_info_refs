Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Sympa web interface, specifically in the newsletter posting area.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File System Access:** The web interface allows access to files on the server's file system.
- **Unrestricted File Sending:** It's possible to send any file readable by the Sympa user to a list or to a user through the newsletter posting feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information by sending files from the server's filesystem. This could include configuration files, application source code, or other confidential data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information could be leveraged to perform other attacks on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the web interface's newsletter posting area.
- **File Path Manipulation:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability likely allows an attacker to specify the file path of the file to be sent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Sympa Web Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the Sympa mailing list server.
- **Authenticated User:** It's implied that the attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating or modifying newsletters, though the specific privileges are not explicitly detailed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Sympa version 6.1.24.
- Patches were created by the Sympa team.
-  Mageia 4, Debian, and other distributions were affected, and security updates were released to address the vulnerability.
-  The vulnerability is described as allowing an attacker to "send any file readable by the Sympa user".

The provided information suggests a classic file inclusion/disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths within the web interface. The attacker can leverage the newsletter posting feature to force the server to read and send arbitrary files that the webserver's user has access to.
