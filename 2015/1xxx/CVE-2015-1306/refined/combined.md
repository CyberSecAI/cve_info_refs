I just fixed the *default* apache configuration to define cgi-script handler only if mod_fcgid is not available, it should be enough. Beware of browser caching when testing.

All that was added was a recommends on perl-FCGI.  Maybe someone could double-check it with rpmdiff or something, but it should still be OK.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Possible CVE request: sympa: vulnerability in the web interface

Hi

I would like to ask if a CVE could be assigned for the following issue
(it is not clear if upstream has already requested one):
<https://www.sympa.org/security_advisories#security_breaches_in_newsletter_posting>

The advisory reads:

> A vulnerability have been discovered in Sympa web interface that
> allows access to files on the server filesystem.
>
> This breach allows to send to a list or a user any file readable by
> the Sympa user, located on the server filesystem, using the Sympa web
> interface newsletter posting area.

Upstream patch: <https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/viewvc.php/branches/sympa-6.1-branch/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in?root=sympa&r1=11562&r2=11778&view=patch>

Thanks in advance,

Regards,
Salvatore

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3134-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : sympa

A vulnerability has been discovered in the web interface of sympa, a
mailing list manager. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw in
the newsletter posting area, which allows sending to a list, or to
oneself, any file located on the server filesystem and readable by the
sympa user.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.11~dfsg-5+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.23~dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.
