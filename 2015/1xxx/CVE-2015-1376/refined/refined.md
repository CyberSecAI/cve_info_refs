Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1376:

**Root Cause:** The Pixabay Images WordPress plugin version 2.3 contains multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   The plugin does not properly verify if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain functions.
    *   This allows unauthenticated users to call specific code within the plugin.
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The plugin fails to validate the host in the provided download URL.
    *   This enables an attacker to specify a URL from a malicious host, leading to the upload of arbitrary files, including PHP code.
3.  **Path Traversal:**
    *   The plugin does not sanitize certain input values before using them in file operations.
    *   This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths and store files outside of the intended "download" directory.
4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The plugin generates an author link using unsanitized user input.
    *   This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the generated author link, leading to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Allows unauthorized access to plugin functionalities.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Enables attackers to upload and execute malicious code (e.g., PHP shells) on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Path Traversal:** Allows storage of malicious files outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting important files or making the files directly accessible via a web browser.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the pages of the website, potentially stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites or performing other unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   HTTP POST requests with crafted parameters to the WordPress admin interface. The identified parameters are:
    * `pixabay_upload`: set to 1 to trigger the upload process
    * `image_url`: contains the URL of the malicious file to be uploaded
    * `image_user`: not properly sanitized for the XSS vulnerability
    * `q`: used in path traversal and file naming

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote attacker, no prior authentication required to exploit the authentication bypass, file upload, and path traversal issues.
*   Ability to host a malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   Basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL manipulation.
*   For XSS, ability to get a user to interact with a crafted link.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to exploit the arbitrary file upload and path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   The plugin's version 2.4 addresses the issues.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Hans-Martin Muench of Mogwai Security.
*   The fix was implemented by sanitizing the path and checking the host of the provided URL. The author link was sanitized and some function calls were refactored, along with other code enhancements.
