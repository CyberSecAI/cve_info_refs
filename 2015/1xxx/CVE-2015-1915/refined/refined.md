- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control fails to set the secure flag for the session cookie when using SSL mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is the lack of a secure flag on session cookies transmitted over SSL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information by intercepting the session cookie over a non-secure connection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a remote network-based attack that intercepts unencrypted session cookies.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between a client and server.
