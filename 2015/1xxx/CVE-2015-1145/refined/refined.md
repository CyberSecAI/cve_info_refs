The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, and one of them is CVE-2015-1145.

**CVE-2015-1145**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how OS X handles code signing. Applications containing specially crafted bundles may have been able to launch without a completely valid signature.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete or improper code signature verification.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Tampered applications may bypass security checks and launch, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.
*   **Attack vectors**: Attackers can craft specially crafted application bundles that lack a valid signature, and the system will not prevent them from launching.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious application bundle and then somehow persuade the victim to launch it.
