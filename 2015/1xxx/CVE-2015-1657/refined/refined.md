- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption occurs due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption, leading to potential remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit these vulnerabilities or use compromised websites to host malicious content. The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website through social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing links).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise a website to host malicious content. They need to convince the user to browse to the attacker-controlled content or open a malicious file.
