CVE-2015-1686
```

- **Vulnerability:** VBScript and JScript ASLR Bypass
- **Root Cause:** The JScript and VBScript engines fail to use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This allows an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.
- **Impact:** The security feature bypass itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.
- **Attack Vector:** In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, and browses to a malicious site.
- **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website. The user must browse to this site while logged in and running an affected version of Internet Explorer.
- **Affected Software (from MS15-053):**
  - Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (JScript 5.6 and VBScript 5.6, JScript 5.7 and VBScript 5.7)
  - Windows Vista Service Pack 2 (JScript 5.7 and VBScript 5.7)
  - Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit/x64-based/Itanium-based Systems Service Pack 2 (JScript 5.7 and VBScript 5.7)
  - Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation) (JScript 5.8 and VBScript 5.8)
- **Affected Software (from MS15-043):**
  - Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, and 11
- **Mitigation:** Apply the security update that ensures JScript and VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature.
- **Workaround:** None identified by Microsoft.
