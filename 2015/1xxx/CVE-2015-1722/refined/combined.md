## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3057839)

Published: June 9, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory and validates user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3057839](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3057839).

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1719

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles buffer elements under certain conditions, allowing an attacker to request the contents of specific memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then potentially read data that is not intended to be disclosed. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system. Workstations and servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage this.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to execute programs on the system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver validates memory addresses.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1720

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly frees an object in memory that an attacker could use to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would first have to log on to the system or convince a logged-on user to execute a specially crafted application. Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how certain objects are handled in memory.

# Microsoft Windows Kernel - Bitmap Handling Use-After-Free (MS15-061) (1)

#### EDB-ID:

###### 38275

#### CVE:

###### [2015-1722](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1722)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Nils Sommer](/?author=8268)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows\_x86](/?platform=windows_x86)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=293

Platform: Win7 32-bit.
trigger.cpp should fire the issue, with two caveats:
- PoC will NOT work if compiled as a debug build.
- PoC will trigger the condition every time but the subsequent corruption might not cause a crash every time. It may be necessary to run the PoC multiple times.

debug.txt is a sample crash log.

Analysis from Nils:

---
Using the series of calls we are able to free the bitmap object, a reference to this object still exists in the trigger process after killing the first notepad process.

At this time we are able to replace the freed object in memory. We are not able to reuse this object through the original handle, however another free is triggered when quitting the trigger process, which will decrement the reference counter on the freed or replaced object, either modifying heap metadata or freeing the object which was allocated in the place of the original bitmap object.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Windows Kernel - Bitmap Handling Use-After-Free (MS15-061) (2)

#### EDB-ID:

###### 38265

#### CVE:

###### [2015-1722](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1722)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Nils Sommer](/?author=8268)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows\_x86](/?platform=windows_x86)

#### Date:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=311

Bitmap object Use-after-Free #2

The attached PoC triggers a blue screen due to a use after free vulnerability. The crashes are unreliable, however you can use Special Pool in order to get reliable crashes. The crashes indicate that it is possible to write to arbitrary addresses.

---
please find the PoC and brief analysis for the issue attached. The analysis mentions how Special Pool can be used to get very reliable crashes, it should crash without Special Pool after a while as well.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
