Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver's handling of bitmap objects. This occurs when a bitmap object is freed, but a reference to the object still exists. This could lead to the freed memory being reallocated for another purpose and subsequently being accessed via the stale reference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. The vulnerability arises because the kernel does not properly manage the lifecycle of bitmap objects, resulting in the possibility of accessing memory after it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. The attacker can run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **System Instability:** As demonstrated by the provided exploits, a successful exploit may cause system crashes (Blue Screen of Death) due to memory corruption.
- **Data manipulation:** Attackers could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation. An attacker must have valid logon credentials to the system, either directly or through a compromised user account, to execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to the targeted system.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application on the vulnerable system. This implies either direct access or the ability to compromise a user account to execute the malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Windows, including Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT.
- The vulnerability was addressed by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

The information from exploit-db.com provides specific details regarding proof-of-concept exploits, noting that:
  -  The provided proof-of-concept code is not reliable in debug builds and may not crash every time
  -  Exploitation may lead to arbitrary memory writes.
  -  Special Pool can be used for more reliable crashes.
