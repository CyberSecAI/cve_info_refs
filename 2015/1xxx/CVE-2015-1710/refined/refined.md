The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin that includes information about multiple vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-2015-1710.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2015-1710:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit this website (e.g., through a link in an email or instant message). Attackers could also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website and convince the victim to visit the page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Affected Software:**

The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6 through 11) on various Windows client and server operating systems.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to install the security update provided by Microsoft (3049563).
*   Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers is a mitigating factor for websites not in the Trusted sites zone.
*   EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate attacks by making it more difficult to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The severity is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
*   The document also contains information about other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update, including ASLR bypass vulnerabilities and privilege elevation vulnerabilities.
