Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Sensitive parameters, specifically sessionIDs, were being passed in the request query of an SSL request to IBM QRadar Incident Forensics.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (sessionIDs) via URL parameters.
- Lack of proper handling of sensitive information in transit.
- Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information, like session IDs, by intercepting the vulnerable requests through MitM techniques.
- This could lead to unauthorized access or session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- Interception of network traffic where the vulnerable QRadar instance is communicating.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept traffic between the client and the vulnerable QRadar server.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to perform a MitM attack to eavesdrop on the vulnerable communication.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM QRadar Incident Forensics 7.2.*n*.
- A fix is available in IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF 7.2.5 Patch 5
- No workarounds or mitigations were provided other than applying the patch.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 with vector AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, which means it's remotely exploitable, requires moderate access complexity, no authentication, and has a partial impact on confidentiality.
