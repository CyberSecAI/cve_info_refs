- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because the Windows kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially disclose kernel memory contents, revealing information about the system. This could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a local attacker exploiting a function call to leak address information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the system.
