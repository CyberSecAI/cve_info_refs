Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-1801:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies within the `s3cfb_extdsp_ioctl` function of the `samsung_extdisp` driver. Specifically, several `ioctl` requests use the `memcpy` function with a user-controlled destination pointer (`argp`). This allows a malicious user to write arbitrary data to kernel memory by controlling the `argp` pointer.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unvalidated User-Controlled Pointer:** The `memcpy` function uses `argp` as the destination pointer without any validation. This allows a user to specify an arbitrary kernel memory address as the destination.
- **Memory Corruption:** Using a user controlled address as the destination of `memcpy` with kernel data allows arbitrary kernel memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By corrupting kernel memory, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges to gain root access.
- **Denial of Service:** Corrupting critical kernel data could lead to system instability and a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **`ioctl` System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by making specific `ioctl` calls to the `/dev/fb` device, which allows controlling the `argp` pointer
- **Vulnerable `ioctl` Requests:** The following `ioctl` requests are vulnerable:
    - `FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`
    - `FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO`
    - `S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_WIDTH`
    - `S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_HEIGHT`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to execute the `ioctl` system calls.
- **User-level privileges:** No specific root privileges are required to perform the attack

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable driver is `samsung_extdisp` (`s3cfb_extdsp`).
- The specific files involved is `drivers/video/samsung_extdisp/s3cfb_extdsp_ops.c`.
- The vulnerability affects Samsung S4 GT-I9500 devices running the I9500XXUEMK8 firmware version.
- The issue was reported in February 2014 and assigned CVE-2015-1801 in March 2015. At the time of the disclosure, the vulnerability had not been patched by Samsung
