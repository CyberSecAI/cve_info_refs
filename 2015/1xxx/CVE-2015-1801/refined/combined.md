 vulnerabilities

Further evidence that PaX/grsecurity are extremely important.

CVE-2015-1800 is prevented by the STRUCTLEAK GCC plugin.

The CVE-2015-1801 issues would have been caught by the ARM port of
UDEREF in non-exploit usage. I'd guess that a port of UDEREF to an
Android kernel would uncover more of these.

It's sad that Samsung never addressed this. I guess they might now that
there's a CVE, as vendors generally only backport security fixes when it
becomes an image problem.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Subject: Samsung S4 (GT-I9500) multiple kernel vulnerabilities

Samsung S4 (GT-I9500) version I9500XXUEMK8 vulnerabilities' report
==================================================================

1 - Bugs description
--------------------

This report describes 5 bugs in the Samsung S4 GT-I9500 JB (I9500XXUEMK8).

- 1 Kernel memory disclosure (CVE-2015-1800)
- 4 Kernel memory corruption (CVE-2015-1801)

Driver affected : samsung_extdisp (s3cfb_extdsp)

1.1 - Kernel memory disclosure
------------------------------

1.1.1 - CVE-2015-1800: Video driver samsung_extdisp (1 bug)
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the s3cfb_extdsp_ioctl() function, located in the drivers/video/samsung
_extdisp/s3cfb_extdsp_ops.c file, the structure s3cfb_extdsp_time_stamp is
allocated on the stack frame. Below, all attributes of this structure:

    struct s3cfb_extdsp_time_stamp {
        int                 y_fd;
        int                 uv_fd;
        struct timeval      time_marker;
    };

In the same function, in the switch case of the ioctl, we can find the
S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_FB_PHY_ADDR request. Below, the part of the code
related about:

    case S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_FB_PHY_ADDR:
        time_stamp2.y_fd = -1;
        time_stamp2.uv_fd = -1;
        /* ... */
        if (copy_to_user((struct s3cfb_extdsp_time_stamp __user*)arg,
                          &time_stamp2,
                          sizeof(time_stamp2))) {
            dev_err(fbdev->dev, "copy_to error\n");
            return -EFAULT;
        }

As you can see, the attribute y_fd and uv_fd are initialised but not the
timeval structure. So, when the copy_to_user occurs, we have a kernel
memory disclosure of sizeof(struct timeval).

1.2 - Kernel memory corrpution
------------------------------

1.2.1 - CVE-2015-1801: Video driver samsung_extdisp (4 bugs)
------------------------------------------------------------

In the s3cfb_extdsp_ioctl function, located in the drivers/video/
samsung_extdisp/s3cfb_extdsp_ops.c file, some ioctl requests are
vulnerable. The destination pointer can be controlled from the userspace.

Below, the vulnerable requests:

    case FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO:
        ret = memcpy(argp, &fb->fix, sizeof(fb->fix)) ? 0 : -EFAULT;
        break;

    case FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO:
        ret = memcpy(argp, &fb->var, sizeof(fb->var)) ? 0 : -EFAULT;
        break;

    case S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_WIDTH:
        ret = memcpy(argp, &lcd->width, sizeof(int)) ? 0 : -EFAULT;
        if (ret) {
            dev_err(fbdev->dev, "failed to S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_WIDTH\n");
            break;
        }
        break;

    case S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_HEIGHT:
        ret = memcpy(argp, &lcd->height, sizeof(int)) ? 0 : -EFAULT;
        if (ret) {
            dev_err(fbdev->dev, "failed to S3CFB_EXTDSP_GET_LCD_HEIGHT\n");
            break;
        }
        break;

The argp pointer can be controlled by the user and it is not verified by the
driver. As you can see, the argp pointer is used as destination in all
memcpy
functions.

These memory corruptions may cause an elevation of privileges and/or a
denial
of service.
