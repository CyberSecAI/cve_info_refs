Subject: CVE request for Privoxy

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities
for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. For details see:
<http://www.privoxy.org/>

Privoxy 3.0.23 contains fixes for the following security issues:

- Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect
  chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled
  (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort().
  Reported by Matthew Daley.
  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/jcc.c?r1=1.433&r2=1.434>

- Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the
  pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid
  pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands
  would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources
  (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and
  should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.
  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/pcrs.c?r1=1.46&r2=1.47>

- Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically
  cause Privoxy to crash.
  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/parsers.c?r1=1.297&r2=1.298>

Please assign CVEs for them.

The second issue could potentially affect other programs that use pcrs.c,
but I'm not aware of any that do. Privoxy imported the file from the upstream
project pcrs (not to be confused with pcre) which is no longer maintained.

The last two issues were partially discovered with afl-fuzz.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for privoxy
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0230-1
Rating: moderate
References: #914934
Cross-References: CVE-2015-1380 CVE-2015-1381 CVE-2015-1382
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
privoxy was updated to version 3.0.23 to fix three security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect
chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled (the default)
they could previously cause Privoxy to abort() (CVE-2015-1380).
- Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the pcrs code.
This fix also increases the chances that an invalid pcrs command is
rejected as such (CVE-2015-1381).
- Client requests with body that can't be delivered no longer cause
pipelined requests behind them to be rejected as invalid (CVE-2015-1382).
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-115=1
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-115=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE request for Privoxy

> Privoxy 3.0.23 contains fixes for the following security issues:
>
> - Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect
>  chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled
>  (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort().
>  Reported by Matthew Daley.
>  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/jcc.c?r1=1.433&r2=1.434>

Use CVE-2015-1380.

> - Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the
>  pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid
>  pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands
>  would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources
>  (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and
>  should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.
>  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/pcrs.c?r1=1.46&r2=1.47>

Use CVE-2015-1381.

> - Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically
>  cause Privoxy to crash.
>  <http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/parsers.c?r1=1.297&r2=1.298>

Use CVE-2015-1382.

> Please assign CVEs for them.
>
> The second issue could potentially affect other programs that use pcrs.c,
> but I'm not aware of any that do. Privoxy imported the file from the upstream
> project pcrs (not to be confused with pcre) which is no longer maintained.
>
> The last two issues were partially discovered with afl-fuzz.
>
> Fabian
