- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Microsoft Common Controls when it accesses an object in memory that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability in how Microsoft Common Controls handles objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to click a specially crafted link, or a link to specially crafted content. The vulnerability is then triggered when the user invokes F12 Developer Tools in Internet Explorer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to click a malicious link or content and the user must invoke F12 Developer Tools in Internet Explorer.
