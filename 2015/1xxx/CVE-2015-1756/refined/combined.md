## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Common Control Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1756

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Common Controls when it accesses an object in memory that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to click a specially crafted link, or a link to specially crafted content. The vulnerability is then triggered when the user invokes F12 Developer Tools in Internet Explorer.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-1756](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1756). When this bulletin was originally released, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this issue had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Disable Internet Explorer Developer Tools via the System Registry**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To disable Internet Explorer Developer tools, create and run the following managed script :

  1. Save the following to a file with a .reg extension (e.g., Disable\_IEDevTools.reg):

     ```
         Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IEDevTools]
         "Disabled"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command:

     ```
         Regedit.exe /s Disable_IEDevTools.reg
     ```

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** The features provided by Internet Explorer Developer Tools (e.g., debugging, performance profiling, testing, viewing sources) will no longer be available on the system.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  To undo the workaround, enable Internet Explorer Developer tools by creating and running the following managed script :

  1. Save the following to a file with a .reg extension (e.g., Enable\_IEDevTools.reg):

     ```
         Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IEDevTools]
         "Disabled"=dword:00000000

     ```
  2. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command:

     ```
         Regedit.exe /s Enable_IEDevTools.reg

     ```
