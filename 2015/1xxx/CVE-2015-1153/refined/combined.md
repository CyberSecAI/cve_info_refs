# CVE-2015-3658

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3646.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3659.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3658 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3658)

#### Description

The Page Loading functionality in WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.7, 7.x before 7.1.7, and 8.x before 8.0.7, as used in Apple iOS before 8.4 and other products, does not properly consider redirects during decisions about sending an Origin header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass CSRF protection mechanisms via a crafted web site.

  [2.4.10-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkitgtk/2.4.10-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications

that use WebKitGTK+, such as Epiphany and Evolution, to make all the

necessary changes.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3658.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3660.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3659 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3659)
