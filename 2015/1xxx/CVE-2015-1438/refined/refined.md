Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Panda Security Kernel Memory Access Driver (PSKMAD.sys) does not properly validate the size of data being copied to both paged and non-paged kernel pool buffers.
*   Additionally, for non-paged pool buffer copies, the attacker can control the starting index of the copy operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow in Paged Pool:**  The driver allocates a paged pool buffer based on a size provided by the attacker. The `nt!ZwQuerySymbolicLinkObject` function then writes the symbolic link target to this buffer.  Because the size of the buffer can be controlled by the attacker, an attacker can cause a heap overflow if the symbolic link target is larger than the allocated size.
*   **Heap Overflow in Non-Paged Pool:**  The driver copies data (specifically, the symbolic link target) from the paged pool buffer to a non-paged pool buffer allocated during a `DeviceIoControl` call. The attacker controls both the start-to-copy index and the length of data copied.  This allows for precise control of a heap overflow by writing past the bounds of the non-paged buffer. This is achieved via a memcpy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution with Kernel Privileges:**  By triggering a heap overflow, an attacker can overwrite kernel memory, potentially including function pointers or other critical kernel objects.
*   **EIP Control:** The attacker can corrupt a kernel object with precision and control the Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) via a hijacked function pointer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
*   **Precise Kernel Object Corruption:** The ability to control the copy start index and size in the non-paged pool allows the attacker to corrupt specific kernel objects with a higher degree of precision.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DeviceIoControl API:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `DeviceIoControl` API, likely by sending crafted IO control codes and associated data to the driver.
*   **Input Buffer Control:** The attacker controls the size of the allocated paged pool buffer and the start-to-copy index and length for the non-paged pool buffer through a crafted input buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to interact with the vulnerable driver, as the driver is a kernel component.
*   **Ability to Craft IOCTL Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted IO control requests to the device driver.
*   **Knowledge of Kernel Memory Layout:** While not strictly required, precise exploitation may require knowledge of kernel memory layout, including locations of function pointers and objects.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in the `PSKMAD.sys` driver, which is part of multiple Panda Security products.
* The report specifies affected version 1.0.0.13 and fixed version 15.1.0.
* The attacker can potentially use the symbolic link target as a pointer to a predictable userland memory location, where a trampoline to the payload can be stored
