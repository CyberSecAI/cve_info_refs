# CVE-2015-1438 – Panda Security Multiple Products Arbitrary Code Execution

---

*From*: Kyriakos Economou <arfproject () hotmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 10 Jul 2015 02:33:39 +0300

---

```
CVE: CVE-2015-1438

Vendor: Panda Security

Product: Multiple Products

Affected version: 1.0.0.13 (PSKMAD.sys driver version)

Fixed version:  15.1.0 (Products Version)

Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:

Panda Kernel Memory Access Driver doesn’t validate the size of data
to be copied to both an allocated kernel paged pool buffer and to an
allocated non-paged pool buffer. Furthermore, the attacker has control
over the start-to-copy index regarding the non-paged pool buffer which
allows an attacker to corrupt a kernel object with more precision, and
control the EIP via a hijacked function pointer.

Technical Details:

b5ae8cc5 8b7508 mov esi,dword ptr [ebp+8]<-- ESI input_buffer

b5ae8cc8 0fb7460c movzx eax,word ptr [esi+0Ch] <-- EAX read size of paged pool buffer to allocate from input buffer

b5ae8ccc 6685c0 test ax,ax

b5ae8ccf 7674 jbe PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x4d45 (b5ae8d45)

b5ae8cd1 668b4e0e mov cx,word ptr [esi+0Eh]

b5ae8cd5 668945f4 mov word ptr [ebp-0Ch],ax

b5ae8cd9 0fb7c0 movzx eax,ax

b5ae8cdc 6850534d45 push 454D5350h <-- 'PSME' pool tag

b5ae8ce1 50 push eax <-- size of paged pool buffer to allocate

b5ae8ce2 6a01 push 1 <-- indicates paged pool

b5ae8ce4 66894df6 mov word ptr [ebp-0Ah],cx

b5ae8ce8 ff159ca6aeb5 call dword ptr [PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x669c]={nt!ExAllocatePoolWithTag}

b5ae8cee 8945f8 mov dword ptr [ebp-8],eax

b5ae8cf1 85c0 test eax,eax

b5ae8cf3 7550 jne PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x4d45 (b5ae8d45)

...

b5ae8d45 8d4608 lea eax,[esi+8]

b5ae8d48 50 push eax <-- ptr to input buffer for storing the length of the returned symbolic link target

b5ae8d49 8d45f4 lea eax,[ebp-0Ch]

b5ae8d4c 50 push eax <-- ptr to unitialized Unicode string to store
symbolic link target (the paged pool buffer previously allocated)

b5ae8d4d ff36 push dword ptr [esi] <-- handle to the symbolic link object

b5ae8d4f ff1514a7aeb5 call dword ptr
[PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x6714]={nt!ZwQuerySymbolicLinkObject} <--- Heap
Overflow because we control the size of the paged pool buffer that was
allocated.

b5ae8d55 894604 mov dword ptr [esi+4],eax

b5ae8d58 85c0 test eax,eax

b5ae8d5a 7d09 jge PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x4d65 (b5ae8d65)

...

b5ae8d65 0fb745f4 movzx eax,word ptr [ebp-0Ch]

b5ae8d69 50 push eax <-- EAX length of symbolic link target

b5ae8d6a 8b4610 mov eax,dword ptr [esi+10h] <-- EAX index to copy the
 symbolic link target. this is also been read from our input buffer.

b5ae8d6d ff75f8 push dword ptr [ebp-8] <-- address of paged pool buffer where the symbolic link target is stored

b5ae8d70 03c6 add eax,esi <-- ESI points to our input buffer (non paged pool).

b5ae8d72 50 push eax <-- So we control the full address of where the
symbolic link target will start being copied into the buffer towards
higher addresses.

b5ae8d73 e864120000 call PSKMAD_b5ae4000+0x5fdc (b5ae9fdc) <-- jmp to
 {nt!memcpy} <--- Heap Overflow because we can control where to start
 copying in the non-paged pool buffer allocated during the call to
DeviceIoControl API.

Impact:

An exploit can potentially use either of the two aforementioned bugs
to trigger a heap overflow condition that would allow to execute code
with Kernel privileges. However, the second heap overflow bug is much
more interesting because it allows a precise control of the index to
start copying the symbolic link target returned by a call to the
nt!ZwQuerySymbolicLinkObject kernel function.

This allows an attacker to corrupt with precision a kernel object
that we control that has been previously put there by performing heap
spraying at the non-paged kernel pool. The attacker can use part of the
symbolic link target as a pointer to a predictable memory range in
userland where a trampoline to the payload is stored.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
