The provided content relates to CVE-2015-1194.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pax` utility does not properly handle symlinks within an archive, leading to a symlink following vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Symlink following:** The vulnerability arises from the program's behavior of extracting symlinks from an archive and subsequently following these symlinks if they are referenced in later entries within the same archive. This allows an attacker to create a symlink pointing outside of the intended extraction directory and write files to arbitrary locations.
- This is distinct from the ".. path traversal" (CVE-2015-1193) and is considered a different vulnerability type.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create a malicious archive containing symlinks to write arbitrary files to locations outside the intended extraction directory.
- This can lead to overwriting critical system files, potentially resulting in privilege escalation or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious archive crafted by an attacker is provided to a victim.
- The victim uses `pax` to extract the archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious archive to the victim.
- No specific position is required but the victim needs to execute pax on the malicious archive.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `pax` version 1:20140703.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1:20160306-1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Alexander Cherepanov.
- The Debian bug tracker entry #774716 covers both CVE-2015-1193 and CVE-2015-1194.
