Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This can lead to memory corruption, which an attacker can exploit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege escalation: If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Attackers may also use compromised websites or those that host user-provided content to inject malicious content.
- Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website via social engineering tactics, such as email links or opening malicious email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website.
- The attacker must trick a user into visiting the malicious page or opening a malicious attachment.
- No special access or permissions are required prior to exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the MS15-018 security update.
- Systems like workstations and terminal servers, where Internet Explorer is frequently used, are at greater risk.
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server environments acts as a mitigating factor.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can also help mitigate the vulnerability if configured to work with Internet Explorer.
