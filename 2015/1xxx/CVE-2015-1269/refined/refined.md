{
  "CVE-2015-1269": {
    "Description": "The DecodeHSTSPreloadRaw function in net/http/transport_security_state.cc in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.130 does not properly canonicalize DNS hostnames before making comparisons to HSTS or HPKP preload entries, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a string that (1) ends in a . (dot) character or (2) is not entirely lowercase.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper canonicalization of DNS hostnames before comparing them to HSTS/HPKP preload entries.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the `DecodeHSTSPreloadRaw` function which doesn't properly normalize hostnames before comparing them against the HSTS/HPKP preload list. This allows an attacker to use a hostname with a trailing dot or with uppercase characters to bypass the checks.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can bypass intended access restrictions, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks or other forms of security bypass.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted string that is either not entirely lowercase or ends with a dot character, used as a hostname in a URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the hostname used in a network request, and thus bypass HSTS/HPKP security mechanisms."
