Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1059:

**Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2015-1059 within the context of an AdaptCMS vulnerability, confirming its relevance. Specifically, the `zeroscience.mk` content includes a reference to CVE-2015-1059 and a description of a remote command execution vulnerability in AdaptCMS 3.0.3, and this is further corroborated by the `exploit-db.com` content which also lists CVE-2015-1059 and details the same vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper verification of uploaded files within AdaptCMS. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate file uploads, allowing arbitrary file types (specifically PHP scripts) to be uploaded.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and then accessing the malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain system-level access on the target server by running arbitrary commands through the webserver
- **Full Compromise:** The attacker could potentially gain full control of the web server and the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out via the web interface of the AdaptCMS application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid login credentials for the AdaptCMS application, as the file upload vulnerability is accessible only after authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable AdaptCMS instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit involves uploading a PHP file with code to execute commands via a GET parameter. The file is uploaded to the `\app\webroot\uploads` directory.
- The `exploit-db.com` content provides a Python script demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability by automating the login, file upload, and command execution.
- The exploit requires knowledge of the admin user credentials for AdaptCMS.
