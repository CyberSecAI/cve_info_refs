## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  IBM PowerVC NoSQL database used by ceilometer is listening on
  the remote port and is configured to allow connections without
  any authentication. A remote attacker can therefore connect to
  the database system in order to create, read, update, and delete
   documents, collections, and databases. Authentication tokens
  belonging to legitimate users may also be obtained from the
  database, providing administrator access to the product.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  Corrected the source code. It has been fixed and will be
  available in the future  release.

  ```

## Problem conclusion
