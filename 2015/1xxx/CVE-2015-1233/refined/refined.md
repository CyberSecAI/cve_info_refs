{
  "CVE-2015-1233": {
    "Description": "Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.118 does not properly handle the interaction of IPC, the Gamepad API, and Google V8, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of the interaction between IPC, Gamepad API, and Google V8.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper interaction of different browser components",
       "Use of untrusted input in V8",
      "Lack of proper validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.",
     "Attack vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft malicious web content."
  },
  "CVE-2015-1234": {
    "Description": "Race condition in gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.118 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by manipulating OpenGL ES commands.",
    "Root cause": "Race condition in the processing of OpenGL ES commands.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in GPU command processing",
      "Buffer overflow vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service via application crash, and potentially execute arbitrary code.",
     "Attack vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft malicious web content that triggers the race condition."
