The provided document describes security updates for OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and Security Update 2015-004. It includes a section detailing a vulnerability related to "Open Directory Client" which is associated with CVE-2015-1147.

Here's the relevant information extracted:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An Open Directory client bound to an OS X Server, but without the server's certificates installed, would send password change requests unencrypted over the network.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of encryption for password change requests sent from Open Directory clients to servers in specific configurations.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** A password might be sent unencrypted over the network. This could lead to credential exposure.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a network where an Open Directory client is connected to an OS X Server without the appropriate server certificates installed. An attacker with network access could potentially intercept unencrypted password change requests.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to monitor network traffic between an Open Directory client and an OS X server that is vulnerable (i.e., client is not configured with proper certificates).
