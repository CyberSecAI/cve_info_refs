- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to Microsoft Windows failing to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type confusion vulnerability in `NtCreateTransactionManager`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass impersonation-level security checks, gain elevated privileges on the targeted system, acquire administrator credentials, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires an authenticated attacker to log on to the system, then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to log on to the system and execute code.
