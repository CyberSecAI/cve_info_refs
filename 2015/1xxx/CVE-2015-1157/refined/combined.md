A bug in iOS sees the Messages app crash and the iPhone reboot when a certain text message is sent to your phone
IBTimes UK

### **Update (27 May, 16.30):**

An Apple spokesperson has responded to our queries: "We are aware of an iMessage issue caused by a specific series of unicode characters and we will make a fix available in a software update."

### **Original article:**

A bug in iOS can see the Messages app crash and iPhones automatically reboot when they receive a certain text message.

While Apple is yet to comment on the issue, many iPhone users on social media are highlighting the problem, with some spreading the particular text string that can be sent to someone in order to force their phone to crash, while others are wondering why their iPhones are randomly crashing and rebooting.

After multiple attempts, **IBTimes UK** has been able to replicated the bug on an iPhone 6 (running iOS 8.3) by sending a message to an iPhone 6 Plus (also running iOS 8.3).

The text string, written partly in Arabic, is just the latest example of this bug affecting Apple's iOS, with a similar bug back in 2013 affecting both iOS 6 and Mac OS X 10.8.

The flaw can be exploited due to the way iOS renders Arabic text. Mark James, a security specialist at ESET explains the problem:

"This bug manifests itself when banner notifications are switched on for SMS messages and then displayed on your phone. The resulting action (SMS display) is not able to be fully displayed, thus a reboot is the only option."

**Notifications**

One way of protecting yourself from getting sent the malicious text is to turn off banner notifications in the iOS settings menu.

James adds that issues like this bug have been around for a long time:

"These type of "bugs" have been around since the birth of operating systems (OS). When the OS tries to interpret something it cannot understand or fully achieve it has a few options open to it. One of those options is a reboot. I am sure we have all had our desktop machines reboot after a seemingly random event has triggered the dreaded reboot. These mobile computers we call phones today have the same core instructions - if all else fails then reboot."

The bug allows anyone who knows the particular text string to maliciously crash and reboot someone else's iPhone as long as they know their phone number. While the bug does not cause any long-term damage to the receiver's smartphone or give anyone access to details stored on the phone, it is nonetheless a rather pernicious flaw.

Tim Erlin, from security company Tripwire says that while the bug may initially appear somewhat inconsequential, it does present the possibility to be used for much more malicious purposes:

"This is essentially a remote denial of service vulnerability, using SMS as the vector. The ability to remotely disable someone's iPhone could be useful in targeted attacks. Imagine if an organisations information security team was suddenly unable to communicate while an attack on their organisation was being carried out. There are likely other ways to exploit this vulnerability, though it's unclear if they might be useful to attackers. The libraries used for parsing text are unlikely to be specific to the messaging app, and so the issue may appear in other places. Time will tell if security researchers or Apple discover them first."

Some users report that after they are sent the text message, they are no longer able to reopen their Messages app without the cycle or crash and reboot starting again. The only way to stop the problem is to get the person who sent the message in the first place to send another message, or wait for someone else to send a new one.

A user could take things into their own hands, though, and send a message to themselves through Siri or from a Mac if they have one linked to their Apple ID. Some users have reporting that sending a message can break the cycle.

**IBTimes UK** has asked Apple for a comment on this issue but at the time of publication has not received a response.

# How to fix the iOS text message bug causing iPhone crashing/reboot (U: Apple statement, watches too)

*Update: [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/28/iphone-text-message-bug-crash-apple-watch-ipad-mac) notes that the bug also crashes the Apple Watch when you try to reply to a message.*

Today news is flying around regarding [an iOS bug that causes the Messages app to crash](http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/26/ios-messages-crash-bug/) and iPhones to reboot when a certain string of text is received. There isn’t an official fix from Apple yet, but there are a few workarounds and fixes that you can do in the meantime before Apple patches the bug.

Here are a few fixes that users have discovered and sent in:

* **—**Have the person who sent you the malicious message send another message effectively canceling out the initial strand

* **—**Alternatively, send yourself a message via Siri, the share sheet, or from your Mac.

* **—**Another reader notes that “sending a photo to the contact via the Photos app can allow them to access the message history and delete the conversation”

These fixes should do the trick while we await an official fix from Apple in an upcoming software update. An Apple spokesperson already confirmed it’s working on a fix that will deploy in a future update:

*“We are aware of an iMessage issue caused by a specific series of unicode characters and we will make a fix available in a software update.”*

   I noted that the bug for me was because the characters were in the notification center, as people send to me via whatsapp, when I turn off the message preview on whatsapp, I became sort of inmune to that message (only on whatsapp), soy maybe a fix for some people could be that or delete all of their notifications.

   Also I have friend that now can’t use his iPhone, it just restarts and restarts by itself having no time to change things on the iPhone.

     Siri too! I asked Siri last night, “What’s the score on the NBA?”, and it repeat the answer over and over again until I tap the home or sleep buttons…

     Tell to your friend to reset the phone (press home and sleep/wake button together untill you see the Apple logo)

     Have the person that sent you the original message text you again so you can get into the message app, then delete the original message

       Funny! How do you get to know who sent the message and how will you contact him?

     the same thing happened with me a friend played a prank on me and my phone crashed. I managed to find a solution from here and it fixed my problem.

    Non of these actually worked for me.. my best method was Siri: “Text myself” then touch the message and go inside to get full control of deleting the message. Going in via the Photos app doesn’t allow you to actually delete the message. Last of all make sure you’ve totally wiped the message clean from all of your other conversations!

    These fixes do not apply for the situation where you also sent someone else the malicious text. They must reply to you to fix

      Agreed. It works

      Rather than them reply you can block the number in messages and go into messages then you can delete the message you sent

    For me all it does is just respring the phone and that’s it? I can get on messages absolutely fine afterwards; I don’t need any of these fixes or anything. iPhone 5s iOS 8.3.

    I tried everything to get this to work and nothing… iPhone 5s with iOS 8.3. I do have my messages se tup as alerts instead of banner notifications, but even changing it to banners wouldn’t allow the exploit to work. I also tried an iPhone 5c with iOS 8.3 and still couldn’t get it to go.

    by removing the “power” line, It’ll become fatal. It’ll keep crashing the messages app…!

    I noticed that if you put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode, and also put the sender of the message on DND mode, the message doesn’t affect your phone (:

      To stop future crashes I went to notifications center and turned off “Show on Lock Screen” and set “Alert style when unlocked” to none. Still get sound when a message comes in and still have the number showing on the badge app icon.

        Meant to say do the above in the messages notification settings.

    you need to have the person that sent you the message text you again so you can get into the message app, then delete the message string

    THIS WORKS – If you received it and sent it, you have to have everyone text you back for it to clear..both whomever you sent it to and whoever you sent it to.

    the 2 step Solution :

    1-put your iPhone date two month forward

    2-go to settings > Messages >(under Message History, select keep messages 30 day)

    NB: this will fix the problem but will delete all your messages inbox.

    a person sent this to me and before my messaging app started crashing i put them on “do not disturb”… it will not let me access the messaging app and it will not let me use siri to text him either

      Go into settings, general, date and time

      Switch off set automatically

      Change date to 30 days + how ever many days old the text message is.

      Go into settings, message

      Scroll down.

      Change Keep Messages to 30 days. You now can access iMessage.

      Hope this helps

    Just an FYI, this also works if it is sent from a non-apple device. Sent it to my Android and then to a Hangouts friends session and it crashed his phone.

      Go setting

      Scroll down to message Turn on Filter unknown senders.

      Now go to your messages at the search bar type in any letter.

      When you see the name of the person that send you the message delete the name.

      And that should do it

      Now go back to settings and turn off filter unknown senders.

    The resolution to the problem, until Apple comes up with a fix, is to turn off Preview and Banners in Messages,

    Go to Settings > Notifications > Messages

    set “Alert Style” to “none’ and turn off the switch for “Show Previews”.

    This will prevent the malicious text from being sent to the screen, which then fails to be able to complete the subroutine, causing a respring that then causes the iPhone to reboot and occasionally crash Messages.

    You will still know when you are getting an incoming text from the “ding” [or what ever other noise you have assigned it} and the icon badge showing a new text message has come in… you just won’t see a preview of it.

    When Apple gets the fix distributed you can turn the setting back on.

      I have the exact same problem, I haven’t found any good methods on fixing it, but if you hard reboot it (holding lock button and home button simultaneously, it sends it to the home-screen, DO NOT UNLOCK IT, or the phone will start the reboot loop again, just take it somewhere and try to get it fixed, they may tell you to reset your iPhone to factor settings as well, (erasing all apps, music, etc. from the phone) though I have yet to try this do not do it unless assured that it will work, and that you have a backup on your computer. I’ll try to find a solution soon, until then I guess we’re both out of luck. If you find any solutions, e-mail me at unrealpictures68@gmail.com and I’ll try to get back to you.

      Okay, so I was able to fix my phone, now, if you want to fix it, you must sync your phone to your iTunes on your computer to keep everything you have on your phone. The reason for this is, that the phone must be restored through your backup. So, If you want this to be done easy, read everything on this link, <http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-Fix-Constant-Reboot-of-Your-iPhone-5S-5C-5-4S-4-3GS-/10000000178022257/g.html> and also to get into DFU mode (Device Firmware Update). Here is a link to a easy way to get your phone into DFU mode, <http://www.tenorshare.com/products/reiboot.html> and don’t worry, the app is safe to download. So, if all goes well and you follow the directions of the first site, your phone should work.

    I took my phone to the apple store, I tried all of these and this the only thing that works: Back up your phone, Settings>General>Reset>Erase all content and settings. After your phone is reset and it’s turned on make sure you SET IT UP AS A NEW PHONE. Then you can back it up AFTER that. It’s a pain, but the only thing that actually works!

    it really works. the person you sent it to, have them send a picture to you and you’ll be able to delete the message.

      Go setting

      Scroll down to message Turn on Filter unknown senders.

      Now go to your messages at the search bar type in any letter.

      When you see the name of the person that send you the message delete the name.

      And that should do it

      Now go back to settings and turn off filter unknown senders.

      If you go into notes and make a new note then go to the share button down the bottom and send it to who you think sent you the message or too everyone it fixes the problem. It worked for me. Let me know if it helps anyone else

    Can someone please help me? I noticed that my Message App keeps crashing if the Message appears on the “Preview”-Screen when double tapping the HomeButton. I already send myself several messages but the preview does not refresh. I also restarted my phone but nothing helped. Is there a way to fix that?

      You need to call a friend. Instead of answering the call, he need to tap the message button on the call screen. And then pick one of the opportunities e.g. I call you later.

      Then you can open the “I call you later” message, and your message app work :)

    Your first tip worked. I asked the sender to send the message again and it fixed it.

      My son, who sent it to me (both iPhone 6) and messed up my messaging, was able to fix it. Try this: text the person who sent it to you via Siri, and then have them text you back via Siri. It work for us – both phones are fixed. For now…

    Get a free app on the Appstore called Battery Doctor. Go to the memory tab in Battery Doctor and boost your memory. Tada, iMessage should now work.

    I also have found that if you turn off your imessage notifications it will not crash or restart your ios device.

    HOW TO FIX:

    Step 1: Select a random phot from your camera roll

    Step 2: Click the share button located in the lower left hand corner (a box with an arrow going through the top)

    Step 3: Click iMessage and type in the person who send you the stupid code, for a lack of better words.

    Step 4: If the solution has not worked by now, try sending the photo to another random contact.

    Does anybody know if this is limited to iMessage only. Would it affect those that have iMessage off?

    Although this didn’t happen to me, despite someone sending the malicious text to me, I see this as a very big deal. As of the time of this post it has been nearly 24 hours since this was widely reported and I’ve yet to hear of a software update that prevents the problem.

    I believe I wasn’t affected because I don’t see previews of text messages in my notification center. When the malicious text was sent to me from a family member I didn’t see the contents until I went into the messages app. I was pretty mad that they’d try it. I’m sure a lot of people view it as a simple prank, but I’ve read comments online, including on here, that some people were completely locked out of their messages app by this and had to go through Photos to fix it. Apple needs to get the update out today.

    1) go to settings

    2) go to messages

    3) set “keep messages” to 30 days

    4)set your date 2 months ahead

    5) you’re welcome

    (all your messages will be deleted so if you have any important messages wait for apple to fix it)

    My sons phone got this virus and we went to store and did everything. Called apple spent 2-3 hours on phone they had me plug it to my mac and back up also reset and still not working can not access the text to reply or send a text, keeps crashing. I am so mad at apple support when I called they said they did not know anything about the virus or bug! Now that I read it is through the server not the text app alone I hope my computer will still work.Any suggestions….

    i have an iPhone6 running version 8.3. i just learned of the vulnerability. i have found if iMessage is open and i receive the malicious text message, my phone does not restart.

    -My fix is to leave iMessage open until there is a software update from Apple.

    Okay, so I was hurting pretty bad without my texts, so I found a way out of this pesty bug! Ask Siri to read you your messages, once she reads it, she will read a name you did not see in your inbox, THAT is the person who sent the bug! I messaged that person VIA fb of course and told them to resend me a message. When they resent the new message, I deleted their entire convo. Deleted their number and put FILTER UNKNOWN SENDERS in my messages settings. I have too many jokester friends I tell ya! Hope this helps!

     If you send yourself a text message through an iPad or a Mac, it will give you access to your messages app, thus enabling you to delete the message blocking your out of messages

     something else that works is to tell your siri to delete the conversation with the person that sent you the bug. or if you have a mac or ipad with the same iMessage, delete it from there and then you can access on your phone.

     I found a solution to this night mare.

     First change your time to future, lets say 2017! under settings, general, date &time, i did mine to 2017.

     Second go to settings, messages, keep messages, change it to 1 year, this will ask you to delete all messages! click yes,

     Third press and hold power and home button at the same time until phone turns on. Wait for iphone to turn on. this should fix it. then delete all your messages on the message app.

       1. Open a pic in your photo gallery, send yourself that pic from WITHIN the photo gallery. Use the icon in the lower left corner of the pic (make sure you have yourself as a contact in your address book)

       2. Swipe down from the top of your home screen. Select the ‘Notifications’ button on the top right, if it’s not already selected. Delete the prank text notification.

       3. Go into your text app, which should now open, and delete out the prank text.

       That’s what worked for me.

       Apple Exploit Solution(s)

       May 28, 2014

       By Insinia Team

       Earlier, we were attacked with the Apple exploit, which uses this code to abbreviate the text in a banner or notification with an ellipsis. The ellipsis causes the phone to crash and, in some cases, cycle and render the device useless.

       Firstly; it’s worth noting that it isn’t just Apple that this exploit works with, it’s almost any device that displays notifications or abbreviations and can’t cope with the result. We’ve so far tested this on iOS and various instances on Android – further research to come.

       We had a number of test devices running different versions of iOS and Android and experienced different results each time. We challenged the devices with various strings, and out of 74; only 2 worked. It rendered one of our personal iPhone 6 completely unusable, causing the phone to cycle from on and off, displaying the Apple logo intermitently, whilst offering no way of fixing the phone!

       In the last hour INSINIA’s come up with a number of antidotes and defences, which we’ve listed below for your reference. We’ve so far not seen anyone else listing these antidotes, but I’m sure Apple are aware and are coming up with a fix.

       Apple have so far not offered any fix (as of 22:30 GMT, 28th May 2015), so please do NOT take their preliminary advice of wiping your device! A number of people we’ve spoken to have taken their device to the Apple store and they’ve wiped it to resolve, but all this is doing is wiping the message cache, as well as pointlessly erasing all of your other data!

       It’s unneccessary and there’s no need to wipe or reset your device, only upgrade or restore from iTunes as a last resort. Follow all of the steps below (or as many as you can do) before connecting your device to iTunes.

       SOLUTIONS:

       IF YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR PHONE AT ALL (CYCLING / BRICKED):

       1. GET THE SENDER TO SEND YOU ANOTHER TEXT MESSAGE

       If the person who sent you the message sends you another message; it should offer a quick and easy fix to the problem.

       2. UPDATE / RESTORE YOUR PHONE ON ITUNES

       Plug your phone in to iTunes and download the latest software update.

       Update your phone through iTunes.

       \*\*NOTE that you will have to unlock your phones pin code before it will connect to iTunes if you wish to make a recent back up. This may be difficult if the phone is cycling. Be patient.

       IF YOU STILL HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR PHONE:

       1. GET THE SENDER TO SEND YOU ANOTHER TEXT MESSAGE

       If the person who sent you the message sends you another message; it should offer a quick and easy fix to the problem.

       2. USE SIRI TO TEXT YOURSELF

       Save your number in your phone as “me”. Then, go to Siri and say “send myself a text message” – enter any message body and tell Siri to send. This will stop you from being locked out of the Messages app.

       3. CHANGE YOUR MESSAGE SETTINGS

       Go in to Settings > Messages > Filter Unknown Senders and switch ON

       Go to the search bar in messages, type the “hackers” name who sent you the malicious message, and delete their message from your phone.

       4. CHANGE YOUR NOTIFICATION SETTINGS

       Go in to Settings > Notifications > Messages > Allow Notifications and turn OFF

       \*\*This will only stop the same attacker from sending you a malicious text repeatedly and will not repair an affected device\*\*

       5. CHANGE YOUR DATE AND TIME SETTINGS

       Go to Settings > General > Date & Time then change the time to 2 months AHEAD of the date today. Then, go to Settings > Messages go down to Keep Messages > 30 Days. This should erase the malicious text you received.

       \*\*NOTE THAT THIS WILL ALSO DELETE ANY OTHER MESSAGES, SO YOU MAY WANT TO BACK UP YOUR PHONE ON ITUNES FIRST\*\*

       6. UPDATE YOUR PHONE THROUGH THE SOFTWARE UPDATE

       Go to Settings > General > Software Update

       7. SEND YOURSELF THE ANTIDOTE

       If you find that the above fail, or your Messages app is still crashing then do the following:

       Go to Notes and type a note with any message body (any text in the note)

       Save the note, go back in to view it, and press the “share” button in the middle at the bottom of the page.

       Share the note via iMessage to anyone and everyone who has either sent you the exploit or who you have sent it to.

       DEFENSE(S):

       1. CHANGE YOUR KEYBOARD SETTINGS

       Do not allow your phone to use exotic or foriegn keyboards, and restrict it to use the Apple keyboard only.

       2. DISABLE MESSAGE PREVIEW / NOTIFICATIONS

       And only open messages from TRUSTED sources!

       3. DISABLE ALL OTHER PREVIEWS

       Including WhatsApp and any other messaging services.

       4. DISABLE UNUSUAL LANGUAGES

       Which will stop your phone displaying anything but Latin.

       \*\*CURRENTLY ARABIC, CHINESE AND MARATHI ARE VULNERABLE\*\*

       5. DO NOT SHOW NOTIFICATIONS ON LOCK SCREEN

       Or your device is vulnerable… Even in your pocket!

     None of these fixes worked for me. Nor did any other I found on different cites. So for those still having trouble:

     All you have to do is send a text to a number of people so that the strain with whom send you the encryption is no longer visible when looking at your messaging screen.

     Then, slowly scroll down and tap on their strain and delete the text from the strain.

     You also have to do that for anyone you sent it to afterwords so that the encryption is completely gone.

       Nvm fixed.

       Just open the notes from your iPhone and press send it as text message and send to your friend, then your friend’s phone will be able to work.

       then ask him to send u any message, then your phone will be fixed as well.

     So what can you do if your iphone is resetting so many times the battery goes dead? My daughters phone has been starting and shutting off continuously for an hour now…and forcing a shut down doesn’t work.

     go to the photo app and send yourself or anyone a photo through sms via the photoapp and voila your phone’s sms app is back to normal.

     So the message have been send to me several times, and now my phone keeps restarting over and over. Sometimes I can get on my home page, but then after a second the phone already restarts. What can I do, if my phone doesn’t stay on for more than 3 seconds?

     It is really bad, I had the bug sent to me around 20 times and now there is no way to fix it. It shut my Siri down to where my phone wont pick up my voice. So that way of fixing it is out, I even go to notes and send a message to myself and the people that sent the bug, Nothing!!! I have tried to change my message setting to 30 day and 2 minutes, nothing!!! I also reset my entire phone and still nothing. The people that sent the bug have sent me pictures to unlock the bug and again, nothing. Now about three times a day messages will come up and when I scroll down it kicks me off again. Ill go back and click on a message and when I click the message button it kicks off for the second time. Ill click messages again and it starts over and will not connect to the message board. Apple needs to send out a severe update so people stop getting this problem.

     My iPhone 6 is now a brick. yesterday I got a blue screen and had to reset it multiple times and it was working fine today, then it just turned off and I cannot reset or turn my phone back on. I received those text messages yesterday and the night before, has anyone has a similar issue? is it related to this glitch? or is it something else?

     Phone has been restarting for about an hour now. I only have twitter installed and never got any text with symbols in it. I’m on ios 8.3/4S with the latest apps(like that matters). The phone stopped rebooting after I flattened it with a full erase. I’m attempted to restore select apps now. Apple needs to get off their ass. The phone went into a persistent loop. Somebody could mass spam the planet and literally take out half the damn cell phone networks.

     FOR ALL PEOPLE HAVING CONSTANT REBOOT:

     1 – Click like crazy on the HOLD button while it is rebooting…

     Continue clicking after a while even when you can see your welcome screen.

     2 – When you finally get to stop the constant rebooting, slide the camera up as if you where going to take a photo. (sometimes it wont let you and you will have to repeat the whole process until you are able to do it)

     3 – Now, go to your CAMERA ROLL.

     It will now ask you for a password.

     Enter your password…..

     VOILA!!!!!!

     (I sent this effective power text to my wife and she was basically divorcing me so I HAD to find a solution)

     hope it helps!!!!!

     Thanks so much! I was starting to get nervous, but sending the photo definitely helped. Thanks again!

## A Simple Text Message Can Ruin Any iPhone

 ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5230b765902949401bc6a7884d5b1550?s=40&d=mm&r=g)[zanzebek](https://zanzebek.com/author/zanzebek/)
[10 years ago2 months ago](https://zanzebek.com/a-simple-text-message-can-ruin-any-iphone/)2 mins[0](https://zanzebek.com/a-simple-text-message-can-ruin-any-iphone/#commentform)

Many people around the web started complaining about some mysterious text message that made their iPhone restart and not able to open the Messages app.

![Zanzebek Blog. Text Message iPhone Bug](http://zanzebek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zanzebek-Blog.-Text-Message-iPhone-Bug_thumb.jpeg)

A short weird text message is available online and it can make you beg for Apple to fix the bug.

There is a way to fix it though:

* You can answer with a simple ‘Hi’ to the sender
* You can send the sender a Photo
* The sender can send that mystery text message again, and the bug fixes itself. Until the messgae is sent again, from someone else.
* Open the conversation with the sender in Mac’s Messages App and reply
* Ask Siri to reply to the sender

Here are some comments from Reddit:

![Zanzebek Blog. Reddit Text Message iPhone Bug](http://zanzebek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zanzebek-Blog.-Reddit-Text-Message-iPhone-Bug_thumb.jpeg)

Image Source: [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/37enow/about_the_latest_iphone_security_vulnerability/)

So I just disabled banner notifications for the Message App in iPhone. You can find it in Settings>>Notifications>>Messages. I did it the following way:

![Zanzebek Blog. Screenshot of Messages Notifications iPhone 6 Plus](http://zanzebek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Zanzebek-Blog.-Screenshot-of-Messages-Notifications-iPhone-6-Plus-450x800.png)

Oh, and don’t forget to disable Message Preview in Other Messaging Applications, such as WhatsApp.

Sadly, until Apple releases an iOS update, these are the only ways to fight the issue back so far.
