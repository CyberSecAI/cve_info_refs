- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially-crafted URL is used to inject malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a victim, who needs to click on it. The CVSS vector indicates that user interaction is required and authentication is required to reach the vulnerable code.
