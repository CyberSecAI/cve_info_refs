Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how PolarSSL parses ASN.1 sequences. Specifically, during the parsing of an ASN.1 sequence, a pointer within the linked list of `asn1_sequence` is not initialized by the `asn1_get_sequence_of()` function. If an error occurs during parsing of the list, this uninitialized pointer is then passed to `polarssl_free()`, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability due to the uninitialized pointer being passed to a free function. This can cause memory corruption and potentially lead to a crash.
*   **Uninitialized Pointer:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly initialize a pointer before it is used.
*   **Improper Input Handling**: The vulnerability occurs during the processing of crafted certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** At a minimum, exploitation of this vulnerability can cause an application linked against the vulnerable PolarSSL library to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In more severe cases, depending on the attacker's knowledge of the system, this vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This occurs because a use-after-free can sometimes be leveraged to control program execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Certificates:** The attack is triggered by parsing specially crafted certificates.
*  **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, through a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is triggered when an application parses a certificate received from a remote source.
*   **Ability to Provide a Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs the ability to make the vulnerable application parse a malicious crafted certificate. This could be achieved when:
    *  A client connects to a malicious server.
    *  A server requests a client certificate from a malicious client.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects applications that use the PolarSSL library for handling certificates.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PolarSSL 1.3.9.
*   The provided content indicates this vulnerability was addressed in openSUSE, Debian, and Gentoo Linux distributions.
*   The issue can affect both TLS client and server components.
