Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `platform/fonts/shaping/HarfBuzzShaper.cpp` file within the Blink rendering engine used by Google Chrome.
*   A specific width field within this component is not properly initialized before use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory:** The core issue is the use of an uninitialized width field. This means the field may contain arbitrary values from memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the use of the uninitialized width field.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:**  The vulnerability might allow for additional, unspecified negative consequences beyond a DoS, due to the nature of uninitialized memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Unicode Text:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted Unicode text. This suggests that the attacker needs to find a way to get the vulnerable browser to process malicious unicode text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be triggered by a webpage loaded in the browser (or potentially by other remote vectors of unicode text).
*   **User Interaction:** It's likely that user interaction is required. The user must visit a malicious website or interact with content that includes the crafted Unicode text.
*   **No authentication:** No authentication is required, the vulnerability can be triggered in a standard browser session.

**Summary of additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Google Chrome versions prior to 43.0.2357.65.
*   SUSE has indicated that their products are not affected by this issue, but they have released patches to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "important" by SUSE.
