  "cve": "CVE-2015-1852",
  "description": "The s3_token middleware in OpenStack python-keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient), when the 'insecure' option is set in a S3Token paste configuration file, its value is effectively ignored and instead assumed to be true. As a result certificate verification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. Note that it's unusual to explicitly add this option and then set it to false, so the impact of this bug is thought to be limited. All versions of s3_token middleware with TLS settings configured are affected by this flaw.",
  "affected_components": [
    {
      "name": "python-keystoneclient",
      "versions": "versions through 1.3.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "keystonemiddleware",
      "versions": "versions through 1.5.0"
    }
  ],
  "root_cause": "The 'insecure' option in the S3Token middleware was treated as a boolean, but the configuration file provided it as a string. This caused the string 'false' to evaluate as true in a conditional statement, effectively disabling TLS certificate verification even when it should have been enabled.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Incorrect type evaluation",
    "Failure to honor configuration option"
  ],
  "impact": "TLS connections are left vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks due to disabled certificate verification.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "MITM attacks on TLS connections using a crafted certificate."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker positioned to intercept TLS connections to the server."
