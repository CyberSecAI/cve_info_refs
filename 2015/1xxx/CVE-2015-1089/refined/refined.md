Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2015-1089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A cross-domain cookie issue existed in redirect handling within CFNetwork.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
Cookies set in a redirect response could be passed on to a redirect target belonging to another origin. This violates the same-origin policy, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Cookies belonging to one origin could be sent to another origin. This could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information or allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user on a different website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack involves manipulating redirects and responses such that cookies intended for one domain are sent to another. This would require the attacker to control or influence the redirect process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the redirect process to trigger the vulnerability. This would likely involve a network position where they could intercept or control HTTP traffic, or crafting a malicious URL.

**Affected Systems:**
- iOS 8.3 (iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later)
- OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.2

This vulnerability is present in both iOS and OS X, indicating a problem with the shared networking code. The content also mentions that the issue was fixed with improved handling of redirects.
