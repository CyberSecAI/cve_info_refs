Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1276:

**CVE-2015-1276**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free vulnerability in the IndexedDB implementation within Google Chrome. Specifically, an abort action occurring before a certain write operation within `content/browser/indexed_db/indexed_db_backing_store.cc` can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A dangling pointer is created when an `Abort()` is called before `ChainedBlobWriterImpl::WriteNextFile()` has set `waiting_for_callback_`. Then, `ReportWriteCompletion()` attempts to use this dangling pointer to a deleted `IndexedDBBackingStore` instance.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (crash) and potentially other unspecified impacts, including arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious web content that triggers the specific timing and abort condition within IndexedDB. The attacker would need to deliver this malicious content to the victim, who would have to open it within the vulnerable browser.

The provided information from the SUSE website, Red Hat Bugzilla, and other sources also indicates the following:

*   The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome versions prior to 44.0.2403.89.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "important" severity by SUSE and "high" by Red Hat.
*   The issue was resolved in later versions of Chromium and was addressed in security updates for various Linux distributions including openSUSE and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The patch for this issue involved changes in `content/browser/indexed_db/indexed_db_backing_store.cc`, specifically aimed at addressing the use-after-free condition. A commit message mentioned it was a speculative fix, difficult to verify, which eliminated a redundant "aborted_" member variable while adding a `DCHECK` to catch the issue.

The Debian security advisory DSA-3315-1 lists CVE-2015-1276 alongside other Chrome vulnerabilities, indicating the wide impact of the security update that addressed this issue.
