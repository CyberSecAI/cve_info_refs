- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Rational Test Control Panel component stores user passwords using MD5 hashing, which is considered insecure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a weak hashing algorithm (MD5) for password storage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Compromise of user passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker gaining access to the stored password hashes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the system where the password hashes are stored to compromise the user passwords.
