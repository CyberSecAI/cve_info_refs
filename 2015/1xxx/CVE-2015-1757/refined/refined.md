- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of URLs in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, specially crafted script in URLs is not properly sanitized, leading to the execution of attacker-supplied script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script in the security context of the logged-on user, leading to potential elevation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must be able to submit a specially crafted URL to a target site and then trick a user into visiting a page containing that URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and have some mechanism to get a user to access a webpage that uses the crafted URL. This could be through a compromised site, or by getting a user to visit a link directly.
