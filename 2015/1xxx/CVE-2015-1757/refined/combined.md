## Vulnerability in Active Directory Federation Services Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3062577)

Published: June 9, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker submits a specially crafted URL to a target site. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content. For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur.

This security update is rated Important for Active Directory Federation Services 2.0 and Active Directory Federation Services 2.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how AD FS handles the HTML encoding of HTTP responses. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3062577](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3062577).

## Vulnerability Information

## ADFS XSS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1757

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that URLs are sanitized in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform [cross-site scripting](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted URL to a target site. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content. For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted a specially crafted URL to a target site, any webpage on that site that contains the specially crafted URL is a potential vector for cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a webpage that contains the specially crafted URL, the script could be run in the security context of the user.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how AD FS handles the HTML encoding of HTTP responses.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Use a web application firewall to block suspicious requests**

  Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block requests to /adfs/ls where the query parameter "wct" contains HTML markup or javascript code.

  **For example:**

  ```
  ```
  /adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm;=https%3a%2f%2fsomesite.example.com%2fRefinishUserAdmin%2f&wctx;=rm%3d0%26id%3dpassive%26ru%3d%252fRefinishUserAdmin%252f%253fwhr%253dhttp%253a%252f%252fsso.example.com%252fadfs%252fservices%252ftrust&wct;=2014-12-11T07%3a20%3a58Z78b0f<script>alert("hello")<%2fscript>b032e&whr=http%3a%2f%2fsso.example.com%2fadfs%2fservices%2ftrust
  ```

  ```
