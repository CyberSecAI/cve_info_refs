Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a susceptibility to a specially-crafted SQL statement attack. This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The provided content does not explicitly specify the impact of the SQL injection vulnerability. Generally, SQL injection can lead to:
*   Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   Data Modification: Altering or deleting database records.
*   Privilege Escalation: Gaining elevated privileges within the application or the database system.
*   Denial of Service: Disrupting the normal operation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of specially-crafted SQL statements. This typically involves manipulating user-supplied input fields that are used to build database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable application that is then used to generate SQL queries. This implies the attacker could be any user capable of interacting with the application. No specific privileged access is mentioned beyond the ability to supply input.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM QRadar Incident Forensics 7.2.*n*

**Fix:**
*   IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF 7.2.5 Patch 5
