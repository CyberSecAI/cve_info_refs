Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A state management issue existed in Safari.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The state management issue resulted in users' browsing history not being completely purged from the `history.plist` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Users' browsing history may not be completely purged, which could lead to privacy concerns if users believe their history has been cleared but remnants still exist.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by normal browsing activity within Safari. No specific malicious actions are required to cause the incomplete purging of history, which occurs due to the flawed state management.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need access to the user's device and the `history.plist` file. No remote access or specific capabilities are mentioned; the attacker would likely need physical access or a way to retrieve the file from the user's device.

This vulnerability is related to information disclosure/privacy, rather than a direct remote execution or denial of service vector. The primary concern is the incomplete erasure of user data that is intended to be private and is a privacy issue.
