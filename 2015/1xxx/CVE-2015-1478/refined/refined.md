Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the jclassifiedsmanager component, specifically within the `id` and `view` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the URL `http://localhost/jclassifiedsmanager/classifieds/offerring-ads?controller=displayads&view=displayads&task=viewad&id=[SQL Injection Here]` is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `view` parameter in the URL `http://localhost/jclassifiedsmanager/classifieds?view=displayads7ed3b"onload%3d"alert(1)"87d4d&layout=offerring&controller=displayads&adtype=1` is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it is not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
- **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application, which would then be executed in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript code within the `view` parameter and tricking a user to click on the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable jclassifiedsmanager instance.
- For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to get a user to click a specially crafted link.
