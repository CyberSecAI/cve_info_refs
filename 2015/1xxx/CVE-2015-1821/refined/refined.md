Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in chrony's access configuration handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  When NTP or cmdmon access was configured with a subnet size not divisible by 4, and an address with non-zero bits in the 4-bit subnet remainder, the new setting was written to an incorrect memory location. This write could go outside the allocated array, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service (crash) of the chronyd process.
- There is also a possibility of arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the chronyd process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who:
    - Has the command key to authenticate with the cmdmon interface.
    - Is allowed to access the cmdmon interface (by default, only localhost is allowed).
    - Can send commands to configure access control with crafted subnet sizes and addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the command key to authenticate with the cmdmon interface.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send commands to the chronyd process using the cmdmon interface. By default only localhost is allowed.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific commands with malicious subnet sizes and addresses

**Summary of Relevant Information from different sources:**
- **chrony-announce:** Provides a clear explanation of the vulnerability and how to trigger it. It mentions the specific conditions related to the subnet mask and address. It details the impact as either a crash or arbitrary code execution.
- **Gentoo Security Advisory:** Confirms the vulnerability and its impact. Mentions remote code execution as a possibility.
- **Debian Security Advisory:** Confirms the vulnerability. Details how particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control would cause an invalid memory write, leading to a DoS or arbitrary code execution.
- **Oracle Linux Bulletin:** Lists CVE-2015-1821 with a CVSS score of 6.0. Classifies it as a network vulnerability requiring single authentication. The impact is partial in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The information from the `chrony-announce` provides the most technical detail, while the other sources confirm the vulnerability and its impact on various systems.
