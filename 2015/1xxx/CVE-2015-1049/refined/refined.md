- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device's web server allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate legitimate users if an active web session exists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate users of the web interface, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access via the web interface (ports 80/tcp and 443/tcp).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the network and needs to exploit the vulnerability when an authenticated user has an active web session.
