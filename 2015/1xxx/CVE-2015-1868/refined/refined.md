Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The initial patch applied to both `pdns` (authoritative DNS server) and `pdns-recursor` (recursive DNS server) to address CVE-2015-1868 was insufficient. This indicates a flaw in the initial fix or a bypass of the initial mitigation strategy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient patching of a previous issue, which allowed attackers to trigger the vulnerability despite the initial attempt to fix it. This suggests a potential flaw in the code logic related to the vulnerability being addressed, or an incomplete fix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS). The DoS manifests as:
    - Service-affecting CPU spikes, causing the server to become overloaded and unresponsive.
    - In some cases, a complete crash of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability. This implies the vulnerability is reachable over the network. The specific attack vector (i.e. the type of malicious DNS request or interaction) is not specified, but it is triggered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected `pdns` or `pdns-recursor` server.
    - No specific attacker capabilities, such as specific credentials or access to internal network, were mentioned other than the ability to send network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Debian Security Advisories (DSA-3306-1 for `pdns` and DSA-3307-1 for `pdns-recursor`) indicate that a follow-up fix was issued in the affected packages to properly resolve the vulnerability.
- The advisories stress the importance of upgrading to the corrected package versions to prevent exploitation.
- The vulnerability affects both the authoritative (`pdns`) and recursive (`pdns-recursor`) DNS servers.

In summary, CVE-2015-1868 is a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by an insufficient patch. It can be triggered remotely, leading to CPU spikes or service crashes. The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description.
