Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `rhnreg_ks` utility, part of the `rhn-client-tools`, failing to properly validate hostnames in SSL/TLS certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper hostname verification when processing certificates. This means the application does not ensure that the certificate presented by a server matches the hostname it is trying to connect to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the client and the server can intercept the connection. Due to the lack of hostname validation, the attacker can present a malicious certificate, impersonating the legitimate server, allowing them to intercept sensitive communication.
*   **Improper Registration:** While the vulnerability can be used for MitM, it's noted that the most direct impact is preventing proper system registration, which could also be achieved if an attacker is already in a MitM position.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the client running `rhnreg_ks` and the server it attempts to connect to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the network path between the client and the server targeted for registration.
*   **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic, specifically the TLS handshake to present a fraudulent certificate.
*   **No root access required on either the target or the server,** rather access to the network and capability to perform MitM is what's needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "Moderate" security impact by Red Hat.
*   The issue affects versions of `rhn-client-tools` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.
*   Red Hat indicates that a future update *may* address this issue.
