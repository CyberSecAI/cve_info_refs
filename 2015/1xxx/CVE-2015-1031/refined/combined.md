How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 Announcing Privoxy 4.0.0 stable
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Privoxy 4.0.0 fixes a few minor bugs and comes with a couple of
general improvements and new features. HTTPS inspection is no
longer considered experimental.
Two new features have been funded by donations. If you can,
please consider making a donation to support future improvements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog for Privoxy 4.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes:
- Add missing client-body-tagger data to the action\_type\_info[] struct
so lookups based on the action index work correctly again.
Prevents assertion failures or segfaults when trying to edit
an action file with the CGI editor.
The type of failure depended on whether or not assertions
were enabled and on whether or not Privoxy had been compiled
with FEATURE\_EXTERNAL\_FILTERS.
Regression introduced in Privoxy 3.0.34.
Patch submitted by Aaron Li in #940.
- Bump MAX\_FILTER\_TYPES which should have been done in d128e6aa4
when introducing the client-body-tagger{} action.
Prevents an assertion in cgi\_edit\_actions\_for\_url() from triggering
after e32d03e0 when using the CGI editor with assertions enabled.
- is\_untrusted\_url(): Search the encrypted headers for the Referer
when the client is using https and https inspection is enabled.
Fixes the trust mechanism for https requests.
Reported by Laurent Caumont in #1767.
- GNUMakefile.in: Let the install target work if no group is specified.
- GNUMakefile.in: Set GROUP\_T when installing configuration files as root
and there is no privoxy user available so the install target doesn't
fail. Patch by Fabrice Fontaine.
- GNUmakefile.in: Don't exit if configuration files are installed as root
as this can be considered acceptable when cross-compiling
Privoxy inside an autobuilder with only a root user.
Patch by Fabrice Fontaine.
- configure.in: Fix argument types in gmtime\_r() and localtime\_r() probes.
Otherwise these probes always fail with stricter compilers
even if there is C library support for these functions.
Patch submitted by Florian Weimer in SF#149.
- Fix socks4 and socks4a support under glibc's source fortification.
With glibc's source fortification, gcc offers the compilation warning
resulting in a runtime abort() when using a socks4 or socks4a upstream proxy.
Despite the warning, the strlcpy() call in question is fine: gcc
misidentifies the size of the destination buffer, estimating to hold
only a single char while in fact the buffer stretches beyond the end of
the struct socks\_op.
The issue was originally reported in the NixOS issue tracker at
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/265654
prompted by an upgrade of glibc from 2.37-39 to 2.38-0.
Patch submitted by Ingo Blechschmid, joint work with
@esclear and @richi235.
- General improvements:
- Allow to use wolfSSL for https inspection.
wolfSSL supports TLS 1.3 and can be significantly faster than
mbedTLS. Mainly tested on ElectroBSD amd64 where it can compete
with OpenSSL and LibreSSL:
https://www.fabiankeil.de/gehacktes/privoxy-tls-benchmarks/
To enable the support, install wolfSSL and run ./configure
with the --with-wolfssl option.

- Add an test framework that leverages the curl test suite.

- Add pcre2 support. Closes bug #935.
Initial patch submitted by Gagan Sidhu.
- Use SHA256 as hash algorithm for the certificate and key file names
instead of MD5. The known MD5 vulnerabilities shouldn't matter for
Privoxy's use case but it doesn't hurt to use a hash algorithm that
isn't deprecated.
Sponsored by: Robert Klemme
- Add support for mbedTLS 3.x. This removes a sanity check
(whether issuer key and issuer certificate match) that seems
overly cautious and fails to compile with mbedTLS 3.x as the
struct members are private. We don't have an equivalent check
in the OpenSSL or wolfSSL code either.
- Factor out newer\_privoxy\_version\_required() and improve the logic
Previously 3.0.11 was considered newer than 4.0.0.
- init\_error\_log(): Include the reason for failures to open the log file.
- create\_client\_ssl\_connection(): Don't keep the certificate lock
longer than necessary.
- Add periods to a bunch of log messages.
- normalize\_lws(): Only log the 'Reducing whitespace ...' message
once per header
- log\_error() Win32: Only call LogShowActivity() for debug level
LOG\_LEVEL\_REQUEST. As of b94bbe62a950, which was part of Privoxy 3.0.29,
LOG\_LEVEL\_REQUEST is used for all requests including crunched ones.
Previously LogShowActivity() was called twice for crunched
requests, (presumably) resulting in an aborted animation.
- Remove ./ prefix from tarball-dist files.
- create\_client\_ssl\_connection(): Make it more obvious from an
error message that a function failed.
- Use stringify() instead of section\_target() and remove section\_target().
Like the XXX comment suggested this could be done my moving the hash
into the templates which seems preferable anyway.
- Prevent some compiler warnings.
- parse\_numeric\_value(): Expect a base-ten number.
- windows/MYconfigure: Have gcc diagnostics in color.
- Action file improvements:
- Block requests to .amazon-adsystem.com/
- Block requests to 0.css-load.com/
- Block requests to html-load.com/ and 1.html-load.com/
- Block requests to b.6sc.co/
- Block requests to i.clean.gg/
- Block requests to s.cpx.to/
- Block requests to track.venatusmedia.com/
- Block requests to secure-eu.nmrodam.com/
- Block requests to o2.mouseflow.com/
- Disable fast-redirects for services.akteneinsichtsportal.de/
- Disable fast-redirects for /wp-content/plugins/pdf-viewer-for-elementor
- Disable fast-redirects for syndication.twitter.com/
- Disable fast-redirects for archive.softwareheritage.org/
- Disable fast-redirects to duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/
- Disable fast-redirects for .creator-spring.com/\_next/image
- Disable fast redirects for accounts.bahn.de/
- Unblock .datenschmutz.de/
- Unblock requests for 'adventur\*.'
- Unblock adl.windows.com/
as it is apparently required to update from Windows 10 to 11.
Reported by Sam Varshavchik.
- Privoxy-Log-Parser:
- Highlight 'Couldn't deliver the error message for [...]'.
- Highlight 'Failed to accept() incoming connection: Software caused connection abort'.
- Highlight 'Keeping chunk offset at 0 despite flushing 31 bytes.'.
- Highlight 'Not shutting down client connection on socket 8. The socket is no longer alive.'.
- Bump version to 0.9.6.
- Privoxy-Regression-Test.pl:
- Let the --min-level option increase the --max-level
if the latter is smaller than the former.
- Add --curl option to use a non-default curl binary.
- Bump version to 0.7.5.
- uagen:
- Bump BROWSER\_VERSION and BROWSER\_REVISION to match Firefox ESR 128.
- Bump version to 1.2.6.
- Documentation:
- Add HOWTOs for https inspection and client-tags to user-manual.
- Suggest to use the force-text-mode action when filtering binary content
with external filters.
- Declare https-inspection non-experimental.
- FAQ: Mention that Privoxy Moral Licenses are available as well.
- Fix LibreSSL URL.
- Update perlre perldoc URL.
- config: Add SOCKS 5 to the list of supported protocols.
- In the Windows build section, note that one only needs tidy
to build the docs. If you're not building the docbook stuff you
don't need tidy.
- trust: Use the words 'allowlists' and 'blocklists'
instead of "whitelists" and "blacklists" which some
people consider to be less inclusive.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.
Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 or later.
Our TODO list is rather long. Helping hands and donations are welcome:
\* https://www.privoxy.org/participate
\* https://www.privoxy.org/donate
At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows 95 and later versions
(98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 10 etc.), GNU/Linux
(RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others),
Mac OS X (10.4 and upwards on PPC and Intel processors), Haiku,
DragonFly, ElectroBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris,
and various other flavors of Unix.
In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:
\* Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
alive independently from the client. Currently not available on all
platforms.
\* Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too,
and the configure script detects it.
\* Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
and server headers.
\* Supports https inspection which allows to filter https requests.
\* Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
configure browsers individually.
\* Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
client headers.
\* Can be chained with other proxies.
\* Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.
\* Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
invisible "web-bugs" and HTML annoyances, etc.)
\* Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
files won't overwrite individual user settings.
\* Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.
\* GIF de-animation.
\* Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
\* User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
"blocked" page).
\* Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
\* Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.
