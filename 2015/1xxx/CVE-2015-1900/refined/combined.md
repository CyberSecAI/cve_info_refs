## Remediation/Fixes

| ***Product*** | ***VRMF*** | ***APAR*** | ***Remediation/First Fix*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 11.3 | JR52770 | --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version [11.3.1.1](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039497) or --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version [11.3.1.2](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040138)   --Apply IBM InfoSphere DataStage [Security Patch](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+InfoSphere+Information+Server&function=fixId&fixids=is113_JR52770_*) Note: Applying version 11.3.1.2 to a previously patched system requires the Security Patch to be reinstalled. |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 9.1 | JR52770 | --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version [9.1.2.0](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24035470)  --Apply IBM InfoSphere DataStage [Security Patch](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+InfoSphere+Information+Server&function=fixId&fixids=is912_JR52770*) |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 8.7 | JR52770 | --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version [8.7 Fix Pack 2](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034359) --Apply IBM InfoSphere DataStage [Security Patch](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+InfoSphere+Information+Server&function=fixId&fixids=is8702_JR52770_*) |

Instead, contact IBM customer support to obtain an updated version of JR42907 |

Note: The same fix may be listed under multiple vulnerabilities. Installing the fix addresses all vulnerabilities to which the fix applies. Also, some fixes require installing both a fix pack and a subsequent patch. While the fix pack must be installed first, any additional patches required may be installed in any order.

*For IBM InfoSphere Information Server version 8.1 IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.*
