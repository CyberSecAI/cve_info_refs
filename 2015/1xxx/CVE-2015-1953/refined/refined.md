- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the processing of opcode 1335 in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A format string vulnerability is present where an attacker can control an argument to a `vsprintf` function by sending a crafted packet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a crafted packet over TCP port 11460 to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send crafted packets to the vulnerable server on TCP port 11460.
