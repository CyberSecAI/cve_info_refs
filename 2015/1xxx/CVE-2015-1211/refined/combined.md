* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2015-1209](/security/CVE-2015-1209))

It was discovered that V8 did not properly consider frame access

restrictions when throwing exceptions in some circumstances. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1210](/security/CVE-2015-1210))

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly restrict the URI scheme

during ServiceWorker registration. If a user were tricked in to

downloading and opening a specially crafted HTML file, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1211](/security/CVE-2015-1211))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1212](/security/CVE-2015-1212))

I looked into this deeper, actually we do check if protocol's http or https for document url in the renderer too but we don't do so for script or pattern URL. For a band-aid I've made fixes in the browser side only and changed these RegistrationError (for easier merge).

I think we were assuming that should fail, and that's where this subtle bug is introduced. GURL 'understands' how to interpret FileSystem URL, and uses its inner URL for most operations, so, say, calling GURL::GetOrigin() for filesystem:https://foo/ returns <https://foo/>, and AllOriginsMatch() for <https://foo/> and filesystem:https://foo/ returns true. ```     | **kinuko** | | Thanks! https://codereview.chromium.org/889323002/diff/40001/content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_dispatcher\_host.cc File content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_dispatcher\_host.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/889323002/diff/40001/content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_dispatcher\_host.cc#newcode88 content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_dispatcher\_host.cc:88: OriginCanAccessServiceWorkers(document\_url); On 2015/02/02 08:37:43, nhiroki (slow) wrote: > ... | | --- | | 5 years, 10 months ago (2015-02-02 09:43:25 UTC) [#9](#msg9) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Thanks!

[## Chrome Releases](/.)

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome for Android Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/02/chrome-for-android-update.html "Chrome for Android Update")

Wednesday, February 4, 2015

Chrome for Android has been updated to 40.0.2214.109 and will be available in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome) over the next few days. This release contains a fix for [some Samsung devices seeing a permissions error](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=451660), as well as the security fixes noted below.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven't yet fixed.

This update includes [11 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-1-M40&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

* [$TBD][[453979](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=453979)] **High** CVE-2015-1210: Cross-origin-bypass in V8 bindings. Credit to anonymous[.](https://code.google.com/u/117154691211413633534/)
* [$TBD][[453982](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=453982)] **High** CVE-2015-1211: Privilege escalation using service workers. Credit to anonymous[.](https://code.google.com/u/117154691211413633534/)

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[455225](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455225)] CVE-2015-1212: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of the above bugs were detected using AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer.

A partial list of other changes in this build are available in the [Git log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/41.0.2215.0..41.0.2271.34?pretty=fuller&n=10000). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Android%20Issue). More information about Chrome for Android is available on the [Chrome site](//www.google.com/chrome/android/).

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/02/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Thursday, February 5, 2015

The stable channel has been updated to 40.0.2214.111 for Windows, Mac and Linux. A full list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.94..40.0.2214.111?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven't yet fixed.*

This update includes [11 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-1-M40&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

* [$25633.7][[453979](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=453979)] **High** CVE-2015-1210, CVE-2015-1211: A special reward to anonymous for cross-origin-bypass in V8 bindings and privilege escalation using service workers.
* [$5000][[447906](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=447906)] **High** CVE-2015-1209: Use-after-free in DOM. Credit to Maksymillian Motyl.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[455225](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455225)] CVE-2015-1212: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of the above bugs were detected using AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
