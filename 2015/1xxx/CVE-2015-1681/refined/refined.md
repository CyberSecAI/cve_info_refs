- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of destination buffers when Windows attempts to access a specially crafted .msc file to retrieve icon information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to properly validate destination buffers when processing .msc files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker convinces a user to open a share containing a specially crafted .msc file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to host a specially crafted .msc file on a network share and convince a user to open the file from that share. The attacker has no means to force a user to visit the share or view the file.
