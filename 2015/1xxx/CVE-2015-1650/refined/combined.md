## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3048019)

Published: April 14, 2015 | Updated: April 21, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Word 2010
* Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack
* Word Automation Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010
* Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2010

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Word 2013
* Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, Outlook for Mac for Office 365
* Word Automation Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013
* Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files, by correcting how Office handles files in memory, and by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3048019](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3048019).

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1641

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle rich text format files in memory.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then, for example, take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit it, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles files in memory.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-1641](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1641). Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Multiple Microsoft Office Component Use After Free Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software that are caused when the Office software improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This could corrupt system memory in such a way as to allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit it, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

## Microsoft Outlook App for Mac XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1639

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Outlook for Mac app that is caused when the software improperly sanitizes HTML strings.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read or use the victim's identity to take actions on the targeted site or application.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user views specially crafted content, which then could run a script in the context of the user. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains specially crafted content that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit it, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Outlook for Mac sanitizes HTML strings.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
