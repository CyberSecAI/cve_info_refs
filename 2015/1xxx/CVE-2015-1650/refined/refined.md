- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires the user to open a specially crafted file using an affected version of Microsoft Office software. This can be achieved through email attachments or by hosting the file on a website (or compromised website) and convincing the user to visit the website and open the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file and convince a user to open it.
