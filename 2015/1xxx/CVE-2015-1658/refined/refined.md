- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, which leads to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This can lead to complete system control if the user has administrative privileges, enabling the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer. They may also leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/ads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious website, typically by tricking them into clicking a link or opening an email attachment.
