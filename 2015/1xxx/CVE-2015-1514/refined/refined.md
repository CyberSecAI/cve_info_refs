{
  "CVE-2015-1514": {
    "Description": "The SySS GmbH found two boolean-based SQL injection vulnerabilities in the web application component of the FAMOC mobile device management solution which can be exploited from different attacker's perspectives.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in two different parts of the FAMOC web application.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database, leading to information disclosure, data modification, or complete compromise of the application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      {
        "Location": "ajax.php",
        "Method": "HTTP POST request",
        "Parameter": "Device ID (REST URL parameter)",
        "Authentication": "Unauthenticated"
      },
      {
        "Location": "index.php",
        "Method": "HTTP GET request",
        "Parameter": "order (URL parameter)",
        "Authentication": "Authenticated user logged into the FAMOC web UI"
      }
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
     "For the ajax.php vulnerability, no authentication is required.",
     "For the index.php vulnerability, a valid user login session is required."
    ],
    "Additional details": "The provided proof of concept demonstrates the SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting a sleep command to induce a time delay on the server response, thus proving the successful injection."
