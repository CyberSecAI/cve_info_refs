## Description

[![@Danielss89](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/632956?v=4&size=48)](/Danielss89)[Danielss89](https://github.com/Danielss89)opened [on Jan 8, 2015](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser/issues/550#issue-53752202)
### Security advisory: XSS vulnerability in login redirect param

`ZfcUser` version `1.2.2` has been released and includes a security for this vulnerability. Fix has been applied in @baf0e460

## Affected versions

All versions below `1.2.2` are affected. `dev-master` is fixed starting from @2cc167a

## Exploits

Because of missing escaping of the URL param `redirect` a XSS attack is possible.

For example: Setting the redirect param to `"><a%20href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a><inpu%20type="hidden"%20"` would result in a link added to the login page.

## Resolution

If you are using any version of ZfcUser below `1.2.2` please upgrade immediately by running `composer update`.

## Credits

The vulnerability was discovered and fixed by [@GyunerZeki](https://github.com/GyunerZeki)
