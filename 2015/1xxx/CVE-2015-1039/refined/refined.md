Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of the URL parameter `redirect` in the ZfcUser login functionality. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to the unsanitized `redirect` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the login page, which can lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the login page, presenting misleading content, or adding malicious elements to the login form.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the `redirect` parameter containing XSS payload.
- The victim would need to be tricked into clicking the crafted URL, typically by distributing it via phishing emails, or other communication methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing the malicious `redirect` parameter.
- The attacker does not need any privileged access or special position on the network.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and fixed by GyunerZeki.
- The fix was implemented in commit `baf0e460` which addressed the issue by adding `escapeUrl()` to the redirect parameter.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of ZfcUser below 1.2.2.
