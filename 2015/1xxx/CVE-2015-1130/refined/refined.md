Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in how XPC entitlements were checked within the Admin Framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Entitlement Checking:** The core weakness lies in inadequate validation of XPC entitlements, which are designed to control a process's access to system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A process could gain administrative privileges without proper authentication. This allows a malicious process to perform actions it normally wouldn't be authorized to do, potentially leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. The provided exploit code suggests the attacker would need to execute the exploit locally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a user on the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system.
*  **Exploit Code:** The attacker needs to have a copy of the exploit code or a similar means of triggering the vulnerability, as shown in the provided exploit.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB):**

*   **'Rootpipe' Exploit:** The vulnerability is also known as "Rootpipe," reflecting its ability to provide root privileges to an attacker.
*   **Affected Systems:**  OS X versions prior to 10.7.5, 10.8.2, 10.9.5, and 10.10.2 are vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Code Description:** The provided exploit code uses a vulnerable API call to create a file with elevated privileges, effectively allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root permissions. This involves bypassing the authorization system when creating a file.

**Summary of Vulnerability Details:**

CVE-2015-1130 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Admin Framework of various macOS versions. By exploiting a flaw in XPC entitlement checks, an attacker with local access can gain administrative (root) privileges, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands with elevated permissions, potentially taking full control of the affected system.

The provided information gives more detail than the basic CVE description by outlining the root cause as insufficient XPC entitlement checking, the specific impact as privilege escalation, a local attack vector, and providing the exploit code and a list of vulnerable operating system versions.
