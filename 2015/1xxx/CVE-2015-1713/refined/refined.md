Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1713:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists due to Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This allows script to potentially run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Permission Validation:** Internet Explorer fails to properly validate permissions, allowing scripts to potentially run with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could elevate privileges within Internet Explorer.
- This vulnerability, by itself, does not allow arbitrary code execution but could be chained with another vulnerability such as a remote code execution vulnerability, where the attacker would use the elevated privileges to gain higher access. This would allow the attacker to bypass low integrity levels imposed on processes launched by Internet Explorer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website or compromise existing websites with malicious content to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website, for example by tricking them into clicking a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website that the target user visits.
- The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers.
- The provided document highlights that this is one of multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities addressed in the security bulletin MS15-043, along with other issues like memory corruption and ASLR bypasses.
- The fix involves adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
