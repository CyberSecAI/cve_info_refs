The content is related to CVE-2015-1327.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to unchecked AppArmor profiles allowing the export of files that are not permitted by the source application's AppArmor profile.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Inadequate enforcement of AppArmor profiles when exporting files.
- Lack of proper validation to ensure exported files comply with the source application's AppArmor profile.

Impact of exploitation:
- File disclosure: An attacker could potentially access and export files that they would not normally have access to, bypassing intended security restrictions.

Attack vectors:
- Exploiting the content hub's file export functionality.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to use the content hub's file export feature.
- The attacker would need to have knowledge of files that exist outside of the intended scope of the application's apparmor profile.
