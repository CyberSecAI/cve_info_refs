Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-1799:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - The vulnerability lies in how the `ntpd` daemon processes incoming NTP packets, specifically in its authentication code.
  - The code updates NTP state variables before properly validating the Message Authentication Code (MAC) when symmetric key authentication is used.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   -  **Authentication Bypass**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication because state variables are updated before MAC validation, allowing for the injection of manipulated data. This is not a bypass of the symmetric key authentication itself, but a bypass of the protection the authentication is supposed to provide
   - **DoS**: Due to the state variables being updated regardless of authentication failures, an attacker can disrupt time synchronization by periodically sending spoofed packets.
   - **Incorrect Processing of NTP Packets**: The core of the issue lies in the invalid packet processing when authentication fails.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - An attacker can inject arbitrary NTP state variables without knowledge of the NTP keys.
   - An attacker can disrupt communication between NTP hosts, preventing them from synchronizing.
   - Denial of Service (DoS) by interfering with time synchronization between NTP hosts
  - Injected state variables can result in a dropped packet in symmetric mode peering and loss of time synchronization between the hosts.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - Network: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending spoofed NTP packets.
   -  The attacker must have network access to the targeted NTP hosts.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker needs to have the ability to send UDP packets to the target NTP hosts with the spoofed source address.
   -  The attacker needs to know that two NTP hosts are configured to peer with each other in a symmetric association.
   - No prior authentication is required.
   - It is possible to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, but not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the content:**

*   **Affected versions**:  ntp versions starting from at least xntp 3.3wy up to, but not including, ntp-4.2.8p2 are affected.
*   **Symmetric Key Authentication**: The vulnerability primarily impacts systems using symmetric key authentication in NTP.
*   **Autokey Impact**: The issue is not fully fixable for autokey authentication, as the protocol can be reset via `crypto-NAK` or `CRYPTO_ASSOC` messages.
*   **Mitigation**: It's recommended to limit access to NTP hosts to trusted sources and implement BCP38 filtering.
*   **Patch**: The vulnerability was fixed in `ntp-4.2.8p2`.

**CVSS Metrics from various sources:**

*   **Cisco:** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C (Base 5.0, Temporal 4.1)
*   **CERT/CC:** AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (Base 5.4, Temporal 4.2, Environmental 4.2)
*   Red Hat provides variable CVSS scores based on specific product and environment configuration, but their severity rating for the vulnerability is "moderate".

**Content Notes:**
- Some content provides more details about the vulnerability and its impact compared to the original CVE description
- The information spans across Red Hat, Cisco, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, and the original NTP project. This makes it possible to identify the affected software and their respective fixes/workarounds
