- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how IBM MQ Light handles authentication credentials. By crafting specific byte sequences, an attacker can exploit this weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by consuming all available disk resources.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted byte sequences to the IBM MQ Light server.
