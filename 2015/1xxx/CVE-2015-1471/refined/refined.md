```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user input when fetching a user profile, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `user` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests to a user profile page by crafting a malicious `user` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
