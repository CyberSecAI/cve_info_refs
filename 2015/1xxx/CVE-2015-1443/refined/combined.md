== fli4l security advisory FFL-1113 (v02) =====================================
Package: httpd
Impact: Root Compromise (Existing account for web administration interface)
Cross-site Scripting
HTTP header injection
===============================================================================
1. Summary:
Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the web administration frontend for
fli4l contained in the 'httpd' package. These include arbitrary command
execution (CVE-2015-1443), XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-1444) and HTTP header
injection (CVE-2015-1445).
2. Relevant releases:
Fli4l 3.x: All versions
Fli4l 4.0: All tarballs up to 2015-01-23
3. Description:
The function show\_tab\_header provided by include/cgi-helper insufficiently
sanitized its input. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
programs on the router as root. The affected scripts included with the httpd
package require the attacker to have a valid login for the web administration
interface.
The script admin/pf.cgi insufficiently sanitized its input. An attacker with at
least "support:systeminfo" rights could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
programs on the router as root.
The script admin/conntrack.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An attacker
could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an
authenticated user with at least "conntrack:view" rights.
The script admin/index.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An attacker could
use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against any
authenticated user.
The script admin/log\_syslog.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An attacker
could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an
authenticated user with any rights within the "logs" realm.
The script admin/problems.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An attacker
could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against any
authenticated user.
The script admin/status.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An attacker
could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an
authenticated user with any rights within the "status" realm.
The script admin/status\_network.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An
attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
or inject HTTP headers into the response against an authenticated user with at
least "status:view" rights.
The script admin/status\_system.cgi insufficiently escaped its output. An
attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
against an authenticated user with at least "status:view" rights.
We recommend all users to upgrade to the new package versions.
4. Solution:
These issues are fixed in fli4l Version 3.10.1 and tarballs of the development
branch 4.0 from 2015-01-30 and later.
As a workaround, the web administration interface can be disabled (set
OPT\_HTTPD='no'). Alternatively, revoke access to the web interface for
all untrusted users and only use the incognito mode of your browser to access
the web administration interface.
5. Acknowledgments:
These issues were discovered by Felix Eckhofer during an internal code audit.
6. Contact:
The fli4l security team can be reached using security-team [at] fli4l [dot] de.

The vulnerability-type information was sent to MITRE without a Cc to
oss-security. Perhaps it will be sent here later. include/cgi-helper
and admin/pf.cgi have the same vulnerability type.

Use CVE-2015-1443 for both of these.

> XSS vulnerabilities

Use CVE-2015-1444 for all of these.

> HTTP header injection.

Use CVE-2015-1445.
