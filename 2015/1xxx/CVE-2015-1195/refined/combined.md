Impact description draft #1:

Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal through filesystem:// scheme

Reporter: Jin Liu (IBM)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Jin Liu from IBM reported that path traversal vulnerability in Glance were not fully patched in OSSA 2014-041. By setting a malicious image location to a filesystem:// scheme an authenticated user can still download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API are affected by this flaw.

"2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1" and "path traversal vulnerabilities in Glance were" but otherwise the proposed impact description looks good to me.

Jin Liu seems to be from EMC. Otherwise looks good. Could use a Glance coresec check though, adding them to the bug.

Prevent file, swift+config and filesystem schemes

This change ensures that 'file', 'filesystem', and 'swift+config' URI

    schemes are not allowed when setting the location field. A previous

    fix to CVE-2014-9493 attempted to address this issue but did not

    include 'filesystem', a URI scheme allowed by the glance\_store.

Without this fix in place it is possible for a client to access any file

    the glance-api server has read permissions for.

Review: <https://review.openstack.org/150736>

Reason: There's been no discussion of this since February. Zhi Yan Liu and I agree that this is a dangerous change, so I'm abandoning this for now. If this is something we want later on, we can always restore it.

=======================================================================================
OSSA-2015-002.1: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal through filesystem:// scheme
=======================================================================================

:Date: January 20, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-1195

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Jin Liu from EMC reported that path traversal vulnerabilities in
Glance were not fully patched in OSSA 2014-041. By setting a malicious
image location to a filesystem:// scheme an authenticated user can
still download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the
Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API
are affected by this flaw.

Errata
~~~~~~
When the original advisory was published a CVE number was not
assigned. CVE-2015-1195 can now be used to track this vulnerability.

Patches
~~~~~~~
- <https://review.openstack.org/145974> (Icehouse)
- <https://review.openstack.org/145916> (Juno)
- <https://review.openstack.org/145640> (Kilo)

Credits
~~~~~~~
- Jin Liu from EMC (CVE-2015-1195)

References
~~~~~~~~~~
- <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1408663>
- <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1195>

Notes
~~~~~
- This fix was included in the kilo-1 development milestone and will be
  included in future 2014.2.2 (juno) and 2014.1.4 (icehouse) releases.
- The OpenStack VMT recommends revoking all credentials stored in files
  accessible by Glance as a precautionary measure.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016

Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal through filesystem:// scheme

Reporter: Jin Liu (IBM)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Jin Liu from IBM reported that path traversal vulnerability in Glance were not fully patched in OSSA 2014-041. By setting a malicious image location to a filesystem:// scheme an authenticated user can still download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API are affected by this flaw.

"2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1" and "path traversal vulnerabilities in Glance were" but otherwise the proposed impact description looks good to me.

Jin Liu seems to be from EMC. Otherwise looks good. Could use a Glance coresec check though, adding them to the bug.

Prevent file, swift+config and filesystem schemes

This change ensures that 'file', 'filesystem', and 'swift+config' URI

    schemes are not allowed when setting the location field. A previous

    fix to CVE-2014-9493 attempted to address this issue but did not

    include 'filesystem', a URI scheme allowed by the glance\_store.

Without this fix in place it is possible for a client to access any file

    the glance-api server has read permissions for.

Change abandoned by Ian Cordasco (<email address hidden>) on branch: master

Review: <https://review.openstack.org/150736>

Reason: There's been no discussion of this since February. Zhi Yan Liu and I agree that this is a dangerous change, so I'm abandoning this for now. If this is something we want later on, we can always restore it.

=====================================================================================
OSSA-2015-002: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal through filesystem:// scheme
=====================================================================================

:Date: January 15, 2015
:CVE: Requested

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Jin Liu from EMC reported that path traversal vulnerabilities in
Glance were not fully patched in OSSA 2014-041. By setting a malicious
image location to a filesystem:// scheme an authenticated user can
still download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the
Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API
are affected by this flaw.

- <https://review.openstack.org/145916> (Juno)
- <https://review.openstack.org/145640> (Kilo)

Credits

Notes
~~~~~
- This fix was included in the kilo-1 development milestone and will be
  included in future 2014.2.2 (juno) and 2014.1.4 (icehouse) releases.
- The OpenStack VMT recommends revoking all credentials stored in files
  accessible by Glance as a precautionary measure.
- A CVE has been requested for this issue, the OpenStack VMT will issue an
  errata with the correct CVE number assigned once this information is
  available.
