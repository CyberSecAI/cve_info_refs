{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the Glance v2 API when handling 'filesystem://' URI schemes for image locations. A previous fix for CVE-2014-9493 did not address the 'filesystem://' scheme, allowing for path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can download or delete any file on the Glance server that the Glance process user has access to. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information or disruption of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Setting a malicious image location using the 'filesystem://' URI scheme via the Glance v2 API"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to interact with the Glance v2 API.",
       "The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the location of the target file on the Glance server."
