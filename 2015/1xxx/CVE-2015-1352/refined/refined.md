Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `pgsql` extension of PHP.
- It occurs in the `build_tablename` function of `ext/pgsql/pgsql.c` where the return value of `php_strtok_r` was not validated, leading to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
-Specifically the token variable could be null after tokenizing a table name with `php_strtok_r` if the table name is `NULL` or only contains delimiter characters (dots), leading to a crash when `strlen` is called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the potential for the `token` variable to be NULL and then subsequently dereferenced (used as an argument to `strlen()`), resulting in a crash.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the result of the `php_strtok_r` function call, specifically for NULL return value, before using it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is that a successful exploit can lead to a crash of the PHP application.
- This is achieved by causing a NULL pointer dereference, which makes the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a specially crafted or a null table name to a pgsql extension function, specifically: `pg_insert()`, `pg_update()`, `pg_select()`, or `pg_delete()` that calls `build_tablename`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the input to the `pg_insert()`, `pg_update()`, `pg_select()`, or `pg_delete()` functions to control or pass a NULL table name or a table name that contains only delimiter characters(dots).
- Typically, this would involve an attacker exploiting a vulnerability to inject a malicious table name into the PHP application's database calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because it leads to a crash. It may require another vulnerability for an attacker to influence the table names in the application.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check for `NULL` return value of the  `php_strtok_r`.
