NULL dereference isinsets() can only happen if ncols is greater than 0.  ncols is:  1276         register int ncols = (g->ncsets+(CHAR_BIT-1)) / CHAR_BIT;  ncsets is initialized to 0:   141         g->ncsets = 0;  and only changed in allocset():  1003         register int no = p->g->ncsets++;  Further on in allocset():  1010         if (no >= p->ncsalloc) {        /* need another column of space */ 1011                 p->ncsalloc += CHAR_BIT;  ...  1020                 if (p->g->setbits == NULL) 1021                         p->g->setbits = (uch *)malloc(nbytes); 1022                 else { 1023                         p->g->setbits = (uch *)realloc((unsigned char *)p->g->setbits, 1024                                                                 nbytes);  ncsalloc is also initialized to 0 and only incremented in allocset().  Hence on the first allocset() call, the code to allocate setbits it reached.  So isinsets() NULL dereference could only happen on failed malloc, and if subsequent SETERROR fails to halt processing as it's meant to.  Is there some code path I'm overlooking?  ``` **[2016-07-20 11:40 UTC] [davey@php.net](//people.php.net/davey)** ``` Automatic comment on behalf of laruence Revision: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=124fb22a13fafa3648e4e15b4f207c7096d8155e> Log: Fixed [bug #68739](bug.php?id=68739) #68740 #68741  ``` |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1053)

## Topic

Updated php55 collection packages that fix multiple security issues and
several bugs are now available as part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server. The php55 packages provide a recent stable release of PHP with
the PEAR 1.9.4, memcache 3.0.8, and mongo 1.4.5 PECL extensions, and a
number of additional utilities.

The php55 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 5.5.21, which
provides multiple bug fixes over the version shipped in Red Hat Software
Collections 1. (BZ#1057089)

The following security issues were fixed in the php55-php component:

An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in PHP's Exif extension. A
specially crafted JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the
exif\_read\_data() function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running that PHP application.
(CVE-2015-0232)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the way PHP performed object
unserialization. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
function could cause a PHP application to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8142, CVE-2015-0231, CVE-2015-0273,
CVE-2015-2787, CVE-2015-4147, CVE-2015-4148)

A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the enchant\_broker\_request\_dict()
function of PHP's enchant extension. An attacker able to make a PHP
application enchant dictionaries could possibly cause it to crash.
(CVE-2014-9705)

A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in PHP's regular expression
extension. An attacker able to make PHP process a specially crafted regular
expression pattern could cause it to crash and possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2015-2305)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the GD library used by the PHP gd
extension. A specially crafted GIF file could cause a PHP application using
the imagecreatefromgif() function to crash. (CVE-2014-9709)

A use-after-free flaw was found in PHP's OPcache extension. This flaw could
possibly lead to a disclosure of a portion of the server memory.
(CVE-2015-1351)

A use-after-free flaw was found in PHP's phar (PHP Archive) extension.
An attacker able to trigger certain error condition in phar archive
processing could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2015-2301)

An ouf-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the File Information
(fileinfo) extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker
could cause a PHP application to crash if it used fileinfo to identify the
type of the attacker-supplied file. (CVE-2014-9652)

It was found that PHP move\_uploaded\_file() function did not properly handle
file names with a NULL character. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to make a PHP script access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2015-2348)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in PHP's pgsql extension. A
specially crafted table name passed to a function such as pg\_insert() or
pg\_select() could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2015-1352)

A flaw was found in the way PHP handled malformed source files when running
in CGI mode. A specially crafted PHP file could cause PHP CGI to crash.
(CVE-2014-9427)

All php55 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. After installing the updated packages, the
httpd24-httpd service must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Because of an unusual process step on MITRE's end, there was also some
communication about these bugs that was only between MITRE and Joshua
Rogers, without a Cc to oss-security. For Bug #68740, the additional
discussion sent to us was (more or less) was that code in between
lines 140 and 167 wouldn't change g->setbits to a non-NULL value. This
is also essentially implied by the reasoning used in the Description
section of Bug #68740. (We didn't want to send the private e-mail
here, but Joshua Rogers is free to send it if he wants.)

MITRE doesn't have a full code analysis and isn't confident about
whether the "explicit null dereference" exists or not. All we can
offer is that the "wouldn't change g->setbits to a non-NULL value"
seems somewhat implausible because it means that significant intended
functionality of the code wouldn't have worked at all.

As an example, this sequence of function calls seems possible:

  p_str - ordinary - bothcases - p_bracket - allocset

where allocset contains:

  p->g->setbits = (uch *)malloc(nbytes);

and a memset (and the code before the line-140 "g->setbits = NULL"
includes a "p->g = g").

We're going to defer a CVE assignment for Bug #68740 until someone
outside MITRE offers additional analysis. It might be worthwhile to
update Bug #68740 so that the "explicit null dereference" term isn't
used. Although maybe a code path with a NULL pointer dereference can
be found, it's apparently not the case that g->setbits is explicitly
guaranteed to be NULL on line 1279.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201606-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PHP, the worst of which
could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.6.19** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.6.19**revision >= **5.5.33**revision >= **5.5.34**revision >= **5.5.35**revision >= **5.5.36**revision >= **5.5.37**revision >= **5.5.38** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

An attacker can possibly execute arbitrary code or create a Denial of
Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP 5.4 users should upgrade to the latest 5.5 stable branch, as PHP
5.4 is now masked in Portage:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev=lang/php-5.5.33"

```

All PHP 5.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev=lang/php-5.5.33"

```

All PHP 5.6 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev=lang/php-5.6.19"

```

Elsewhere, the result of php_strtok_r() is checked against NULL, and should be here too.  A quick look shows that this may be reproducable by running pg_insert() with a NULL table-name.     ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2015-01-08 08:09 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` Automatic comment on behalf of laruence Revision: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=124fb22a13fafa3648e4e15b4f207c7096d8155e> Log: Fixed [bug #68739](bug.php?id=68739) #68740 #68741  ``` **[2015-01-08 08:15 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** -Status: Open +Status: Closed -Assigned To: +Assigned To: laruence **[2015-01-08 08:15 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` The fix for this bug has been committed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-26 15:25:05 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that a null pointer dereference is possible in 'pgsql' PHP extension, when running pg_insert() with a NULL table-name. Upstream commit with the fix: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=124fb22a13fafa3648e4e15b4f207c7096d8155e>  [1]: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68741>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-26 15:27:03 UTC  ```  Created php tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1185897](show_bug.cgi?id=1185897 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-1351 CVE-2015-1352 CVE-2015-1353 php: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c2)  Remi Collet    2015-04-02 14:07:06 UTC  ``` Notice about this issue: If the (remote) user can change the SQL request to send a NULL table-name, the system have much more serious issues that this segfault.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-04-08 11:27:26 UTC  ``` This issue was introduced via this bug / commit:  <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62978> <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=f718684a6c1d6221015031d1e72d3eb55ecbb659>  in upstream PHP versions 5.4.20 and 5.5.2.  Therefore, this did not affect PHP packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of PHP as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-04-08 11:33:09 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report indicates that this can be triggered with pg_insert() with NULL table name.  In addition to pg_insert(), build_tablename() is also called by pg_update(), pg_select() and pg_delete().  In all cases, code ensures that table name is not NULL.  However, php_strtok_r() can also return NULL if string only consists of delimiter characters (in this case, if table name only contains dots).  As noted in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c2), table name is unlikely to come from untrusted source, and if it is, the PHP application likely has bigger issues.  Therefore, this has minimal impact.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c8)  Fedora Update System    2015-04-22 22:51:45 UTC  ``` php-5.6.8-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c9)  Fedora Update System    2015-04-23 16:10:58 UTC  ``` php-5.6.8-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c10)  Fedora Update System    2015-04-27 08:39:26 UTC  ``` php-5.5.24-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1185904#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-06-04 08:07:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 EUS  Via RHSA-2015:1053 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1053.html>   ``` |  |
