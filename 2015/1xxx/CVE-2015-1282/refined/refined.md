Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1282:

**1. Verification:**

The content from multiple sources, including SUSE, Red Hat, Debian, and Google's Chromium blog, directly refers to CVE-2015-1282 and provides information about it. The descriptions match the official CVE description.

**2. Analysis of CVE-2015-1282:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to multiple use-after-free issues in `fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp` within the PDFium library. Specifically, the `Document::delay` and `Document::DoFieldDelay` functions do not properly manage memory, leading to use-after-free conditions when processing crafted PDF documents. The core issue is improper handling of CJS_DelayData objects during processing delays, where objects are freed from m_DelayData array, but still accessed later.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Use-After-Free:** The code attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or the ability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause the application to crash.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It is possible that the attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application by exploiting the use-after-free.
*  **Attack Vectors:** 
    *   **Crafted PDF Document:** The attacker would need to create a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to entice a user to open the malicious PDF file.
    *   **No special privileges needed**: No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details:**
    *   **Specific Functions**: The `Document::delay` and `Document::DoFieldDelay` functions in `fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp` are specifically mentioned as the location of the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Details**: The fix involves removing `CJS_DelayData` objects from `m_DelayData` and copying them to a new array before processing them, which avoids use after free.
    *  **Google Patch**: Google fixed this issue in Chromium version 44.0.2403.89.

**4. Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   **SUSE:** Provides the CVE description, CVSS v2 score, Bugzilla entry, and list of affected and fixed packages for openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed. Also mentions the overall state of this security issue as "Resolved" with an "important" severity rating.
*   **Red Hat:** Provides the CVE description, errata information, and bugzilla information for this issue affecting Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary and lists the fixed version of chromium-browser.
*   **Debian:** Mentions the vulnerability as part of a larger security update for the `chromium-browser` package, listing it alongside other CVEs fixed in version 44.0.2403.89-1.
*   **Google Chromium Releases:** Acknowledges the security fix and gives credit to Chamal de Silva for discovering it.
*   **PDFium Source Code:** Indicates the fix (commit `4ff7a4246c81a71b4f878e959b3ca304cd76ec8a`) in `fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp` includes removing CJS_DelayData objects from `m_DelayData` array and copying to new one before processing.
*   **Gentoo:** Includes CVE-2015-1282 in the list of CVEs addressed by upgrading to Chromium 49.0.2623.87, which is not the version in which it was fixed, however, they do acknowledge it was patched as part of that version.

In summary, the information from various sources provides a comprehensive overview of the CVE-2015-1282 vulnerability, its root cause, potential impact, and how it was addressed by affected vendors.
