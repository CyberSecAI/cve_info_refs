The vulnerability is a result of a race condition in the GPU service, specifically in 'gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc', that can be triggered by manipulating OpenGL ES commands. This can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via buffer overflow, potentially leading to application crashes. Additional impact could possibly result in unspecified code execution. The vulnerability was fixed by upgrading Chrome to version 41.0.2272.118.",
