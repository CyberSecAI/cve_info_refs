- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles buffer elements under certain conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The driver doesn't properly validate memory addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read data from memory that is not intended to be disclosed. This could be used to further compromise the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to execute programs on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute programs.
