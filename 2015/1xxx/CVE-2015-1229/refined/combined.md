potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215, CVE-2015-1216,
CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1219, CVE-2015-1220, CVE-2015-1221,
CVE-2015-1222, CVE-2015-1223, CVE-2015-1224, CVE-2015-1225, CVE-2015-1226,

You probably want Proxy-Authenticate, though, right?  Yeah, agreed.  Is there a way that is more efficient than RemoveHeader-ing each of the non-Proxy-Authenticate headers (which is O(n^2)) and less kludgey than reassembling new fake raw headers with just the Proxy-Authenticate header? ```     | **Ryan Hamilton** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc File net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc#newcode78 net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc:78: return true; On 2014/12/02 20:10:21, ttuttle wrote: > On ... | | --- | | 6 years ago (2014-12-02 20:14:25 UTC) [#8](#msg8) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy_client_so...](https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc) File net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy_client_so...](https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/20001/net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc#newcode78) net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc:78: return true; On 2014/12/02 20:10:21, ttuttle wrote: > On 2014/12/02 01:50:52, Ryan Hamilton wrote: > > On 2014/12/01 21:28:49, Ryan Sleevi wrote: > > > I have trouble convincing myself a blacklist is the right approach here. > > >  > > > Why can you not strip out ALL headers except for WWW-Authenticate? > >  > > Sounds reasonable!

As far as kludges go, the "assemble new fake raw headers" seems to be pretty simple. Since it's what's done in SanitizeProxyRedirect, that seems like a good approach to me. ```     | **asanka** | | I'm good with sanitizing the response headers, but is there also an underlying problem where ... | | --- | | 6 years ago (2014-12-02 20:29:01 UTC) [#9](#msg9) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` I'm good with sanitizing the response headers, but is there also an underlying problem where the proxy tunnel response isn't distinguished from a server response?

In the non-tunnel case, the proxy totally 0wn the response. It writes the response body and headers. If the proxy is malicious, you're totally screwed and there is nothing that can be done.

I made a simple attempt at sanitizing the response by creating new raw headers, but a bunch of unit tests are failing because I've mangled things like keep-alive headers and prevented us from displaying the proxy error pages in cases where we expected to see them. Is it okay if I change these for the new expected behavior?

But I have lost that battle long, long ago.

We do follow 302s and of course we do handle 407s. But I think that, as this bug suggests, we handle 407s buggily.

I could try to preserve it, and then the "drain body for auth response" logic would probably still work even if the headers are fake.  Respecting keep-alive is important for connection based authentication schemes like NTLM / Negotiate.

Good catch!  The answer is minimally, ttuttle should write a unit test for that :D  I reached the same conclusion you did, and I think it will indeed be a problem.

Do you understand why Content-Length is not required?  Agreed. This is why I have trouble understanding how this doesn't break something.  If a proxy sends a response along with the initial body, and we're going to re-use that connection, we need the presence of Keep-Alive (either implicit or explicit) and the ability to drain the body.  I don't think the tests send dummy bodies, and so it falls under the "IsConnectedAndIdle" check and decides it doesn't need to drain the body. But we should. ```     | **Deprecated (see juliatuttle)** | | On 2014/12/19 21:30:25, Ryan Sleevi wrote: > https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc > File net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc (right): > > https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy\_client\_socket.cc#newcode99 ... | | --- | | 6 years ago (2014-12-19 21:40:43 UTC) [#35](#msg35) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2014/12/19 21:30:25, Ryan Sleevi wrote: > [https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy_client_s...](https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc) > File net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc (right): >  > [https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy_client_s...](https://codereview.chromium.org/769043003/diff/220001/net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc#newcode99) > net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc:99: CopyHeaderValues(old_headers, new_headers, > "Connection"); > On 2014/12/19 21:26:59, Ryan Hamilton wrote: > > I sure would have thought that you'd need both Connection and Content-length > (or > > a synthetic C-L).

We do preserve the Keep-Alive header over now.  Content-Length isn't required because it's saved in the HttpStreamParser, which knows how to read to the end of the body.  > I don't think the tests send dummy bodies, and so it falls under the > "IsConnectedAndIdle" check and decides it doesn't need to drain the body.

## Details

Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2015-1213](/security/CVE-2015-1213), [CVE-2015-1214](/security/CVE-2015-1214), [CVE-2015-1215](/security/CVE-2015-1215))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-1216](/security/CVE-2015-1216))

Multiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1217](/security/CVE-2015-1217), [CVE-2015-1230](/security/CVE-2015-1230))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1218](/security/CVE-2015-1218), [CVE-2015-1223](/security/CVE-2015-1223))

An integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2015-1219](/security/CVE-2015-1219))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2015-1220](/security/CVE-2015-1220))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2015-1221](/security/CVE-2015-1221))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker

implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these

to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1222](/security/CVE-2015-1222))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1224](/security/CVE-2015-1224))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read

uninitialized memory. ([CVE-2015-1227](/security/CVE-2015-1227))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data

structure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1228](/security/CVE-2015-1228))

It was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject

cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a

malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2015-1229](/security/CVE-2015-1229))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1231](/security/CVE-2015-1231))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-2238](/security/CVE-2015-2238))

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
