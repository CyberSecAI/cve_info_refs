Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation of parameters in a variant of the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) REST API.
- A configuration setting that prevents JavaScript from running was not honored while variables were processed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-side JavaScript injection vulnerability.
- Failure to honor a security configuration parameter intended to prevent JavaScript execution during variable processing.
- Exposure of a REST API that allows remote invocation of server-side JavaScript not intended for remote access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the server.
- Bypassing of authorization checks.
- Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:C/I:C/A:C)

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted JavaScript code within the parameters of a vulnerable IBM BPM REST API.
- Remote exploitation via network connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user
- Ability to send requests to the vulnerable REST API
