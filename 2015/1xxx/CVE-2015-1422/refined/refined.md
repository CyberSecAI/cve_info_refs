{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has insufficient input sanitization leading to multiple vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could add an administrative user, inject malicious scripts into the application, manipulate data or expose system information and sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST requests to the admin panel to add an administrative user via CSRF.",
    "HTTP POST requests to the admin panel with malicious script in parameters for stored XSS.",
      "HTTP POST requests to the admin panel with SQL injection payloads in parameters.",
    "HTTP GET requests to the admin panel with malicious scripts in various parameters for reflected XSS."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to induce an authenticated user to perform actions (CSRF) or to browse specific crafted URLs. The other attacks can be achieved by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
