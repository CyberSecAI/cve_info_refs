Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2015-1902
*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow when processing BMP image dimensions, leading to undersized buffer allocation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Integer overflow
    *   Insufficient buffer allocation
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM user privileges.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted BMP image via email. The vulnerability exists in `nrouter.exe`, which processes emails from `nsmtp.exe` (listening on port 25).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Remote attacker
    *   No authentication required
    *   Ability to send a specially crafted BMP image through email.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an integer overflow in IBM Lotus Domino's handling of BMP images. By sending a malicious BMP file with crafted dimensions, an attacker can cause an undersized buffer to be allocated leading to arbitrary code execution with system level privileges on the vulnerable server. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication.
