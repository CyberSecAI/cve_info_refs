The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-1762.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of internal function calls to uninitialized memory in Microsoft SQL Server. Specifically, a specially crafted query can cause the execution of a virtual function from a wrong memory address, which leads to a function call to uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of internal function calls.
- Incorrect pointer usage, leading to calls to uninitialized memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
- Install programs
- View, change, or delete data
- Create new accounts

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with specific permissions, such as `VIEW SERVER STATE`.
- The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted query.
- Transactional replication must also be enabled to successfully exploit this vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user
- Privileged user with specific permissions like `VIEW SERVER STATE`
- Ability to execute a specially crafted query
- Transactional replication enabled
