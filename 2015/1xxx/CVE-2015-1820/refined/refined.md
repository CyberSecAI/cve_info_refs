Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `rest-client` Ruby library's handling of HTTP redirects. Specifically, when encountering a 30x redirect response, the library blindly passes along all `Set-Cookie` headers from the redirecting server to the target URL, without considering domain, path, expiration, or secure cookie settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Cookie Handling:** The core issue is the lack of validation and filtering of cookies during redirects. `rest-client` does not verify if the cookie is intended for the redirection target.
*   **Session Fixation:** The vulnerability can be exploited to perform a session fixation attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Fixation:** An attacker controlling the redirection source can force a client using rest-client to make a request to a third-party domain with attacker-controlled cookies. If the third-party site does not properly reset sessions after login, an attacker can use these cookies to hijack a session.
*   **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker controlling the redirection target can steal cookies from a third-party domain that redirects to it, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts if the cookies are for authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Redirection Source Manipulation:** An attacker can control the initial server that sends a redirect to force the client to send crafted cookies to the target URL.
*   **Redirection Target Manipulation:** An attacker can control the target of a redirection initiated by a third party, enabling them to steal the cookies set by the third party server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over redirection source:** The attacker needs to control a server that can send an HTTP redirect to a client using the vulnerable `rest-client`.
*   **Control over redirection target:** The attacker needs to control the URL that a third-party server redirects to. This requires being able to manipulate a third-party site's redirection behavior.
*   **Client interaction:** The attacker needs to make a client use `rest-client` to connect to a manipulated server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable behavior was introduced in `rest-client` version 1.6.1 and affects all subsequent 1.6.x and 1.7.x releases.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.8.0 and included several commits related to cookie handling.
*   This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2015-2296, which affected the `python-requests` library.
