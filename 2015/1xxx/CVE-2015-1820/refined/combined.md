# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

## Description

[![@ab](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/350770?v=4&size=48)](/ab)[ab](https://github.com/ab)opened [on Mar 24, 2015](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/issues/369#issue-63889103)

When Ruby rest-client [1] processes an HTTP redirection response, it blindly passes along the values from any Set-Cookie headers to the redirection target, regardless of domain, path, or expiration.

This is very similar to [CVE-2015-2296](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pg2w-x9wp-vw92 "CVE-2015-2296"), which affected python-requests.

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/14/4>

The issue could be similarly exploited in the following ways:

* If you are the redirection source (i.e. you can make rest-client hit

  your URL), you can make rest-client perform a request to any

  third-party domain with cookies of your choosing. This may be useful

  in performing a session fixation attack.
* If you are the redirection target (i.e. you can make a third-party

  site redirect to your URL), you can steal any cookies set by the

  third-party redirection.

The behavior was introduced in rest-client 1.6.1 by this commit:

[75ab0dc](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/commit/75ab0dc7ef85490af22328de25ae0a11e8292f1e).

All subsequently released 1.6.x and 1.7.x versions are affected.

This issue is expected to be fixed in a forthcoming rest-client 1.8.0 release.

Subject: CVE-2015-1820: ruby rest-client session fixation vulnerability

Following the very similar vulnerability in python-requests
(CVE-2015-2296), the rest-client team discovered a vulnerability which
has now been fixed in rest-client 1.8.0.
<https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client/versions/1.8.0>
<https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/issues/369>

The problematic behavior was introduced in rest-client 1.6.1: any
Set-Cookie headers present in an HTTP 30x redirection response are
blindly sent to the redirection target, regardless of domain, path,
expiration, or secure cookie settings. All subsequent 1.6.x and 1.7.x
releases are affected.

Similarly to the issue with python-requests, the issue could be
exploited in the following ways:

- If you are the redirection source (i.e. you can make rest-client hit
your URL), you can make rest-client perform a request to any
third-party domain with cookies of your choosing. This may be useful
in performing a session fixation attack.
- If you are the redirection target (i.e. you can make a third-party
site redirect to your URL), you can steal any cookies set by the
third-party redirection.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-1820.

Cheers,
Andy

This may be useful in performing a session fixation attack.  This means vulnerable product we ship must make request to malicious site (to get fixated cookie) AND upon getting redirect log in to the victim site (using attacker supplied cookie) AND we assume the product uses cookies to authenticate with victim site AND that victim site does not reset session after login (i.e. is vulnerable to session fixation).  - If you are the redirection target (i.e. you can make a third-party site redirect to your URL), you can steal any cookies set by the third-party redirection.  This means vulnerable product we ship must make a request to vulnerable site AND attacker must arrange vulnerable site redirects to his malicious one AND we assume the product uses cookies to authenticate with victim site.  Based on the above analysis, the security implications of this issue are quite minimal.   ``` |  |
