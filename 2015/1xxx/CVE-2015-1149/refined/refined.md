- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A register allocation issue in clang.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack cookie pointers could be stored on the stack itself, potentially bypassing stack guards.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to bypass stack guards.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is within the clang compiler, meaning an attacker would need to provide malicious code that triggers this behavior.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to compile code with a vulnerable version of clang.
