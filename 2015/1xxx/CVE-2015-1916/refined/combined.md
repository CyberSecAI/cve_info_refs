An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-2808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808) **DESCRIPTION:** The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Mitigation for CVE-2015-2808 on IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 7, 7R1 and 8:

* Disable RC4 cipher suites by adding "RC4" to the list of disabled algorithms defined by the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property in the java.security file.

No equivalent mitigation is available for IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6, and IBM SDK, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0. For these versions the code fix must be applied.
