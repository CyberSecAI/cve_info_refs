{
  "CVE-2015-1577": {
    "Root cause": "The 'f' parameter in 'deletefile.php' is not properly sanitized before being used to delete files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Arbitrary File Deletion"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server with the permissions of the web server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the 'deletefile.php' script with a malicious value in the 'f' parameter.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need to be authenticated. The attacker can use either an absolute path, or directory traversal sequences within the 'f' parameter."
