Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "result" parameter within the poll archive functionality of the CMS PHPKit WCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application takes user-supplied input in the `result` parameter and reflects it back to the user without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other actions that could compromise user accounts and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request targeting the poll archive page (`/upload_files/pk/include.php?path=pollarchive`).
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The attack payload is injected into the `result` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the target web server.
*   **Awareness of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/upload_files/pk/include.php?path=pollarchive`) and parameter (`result`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious URL with a crafted payload injected into the `result` parameter. This URL would need to be delivered to a victim user via social engineering, a link embedded on a different website or through other means.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory was released due to the vendor not responding to the security issue.
*   The affected software is CMS PHPKit WCMS v. 1.6.6.
*   The specific vulnerable URL is: `http://{TARGET}/upload_files/pk/include.php?path=pollarchive&result=1`.
*   An exploit example is provided: `http://{TARGET}/upload_files/pk/include.php?path=pollarchive&result=1%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E%3C!--`
