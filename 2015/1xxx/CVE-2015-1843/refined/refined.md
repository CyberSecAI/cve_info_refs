Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1843:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-5277 in the docker client. Specifically, the docker client was found to have a regression that allowed it to fall back to HTTP when an HTTPS connection to a registry failed. This fallback to HTTP occurred under certain circumstances and was not intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure fallback: The primary weakness is the docker client's behavior of falling back to HTTP when an HTTPS connection to a registry fails.
- Protocol downgrade: The client unintentionally downgrades the connection from HTTPS to HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: An attacker positioned between the docker client and the registry can intercept the HTTP traffic.
- Data exposure: This allows the attacker to obtain authentication credentials and image data sent between the client and the registry.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network interception: The attacker needs to be on the network path between the docker client and the registry.
- Failure of HTTPS connection: The attack is triggered when an initial attempt to connect via HTTPS fails which leads to the fallback to HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the docker client and the registry.
- Ability to cause HTTPS connection failure (optional): While not strictly required to perform the attack, an attacker can cause an HTTPS connection to fail by, for example, blocking port 443 traffic, ensuring the fallback to HTTP is triggered.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was originally reported as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) specific problem, but it was later determined to be a regression present in upstream docker builds as well.
- The fix for this issue was included in `docker-1.5.0-28.el7_1`.
- The vulnerability is related to how the docker client handles registry connections. If the initial HTTPS connection fails, it can fall back to HTTP.
- The issue was fixed by ensuring that the client does not fallback to HTTP when an HTTPS connection fails.
- The `--insecure-registry` flag would allow the fallback, as designed.
- The vulnerability does not involve the sending of credentials intended for docker.io to registry.access.redhat.com after a specific patch in mid-February.
