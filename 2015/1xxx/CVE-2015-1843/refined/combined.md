| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c0)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 05:49:33 UTC  ```  A regression of [CVE-2014-5277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5277) was found in the current version of the docker client on RHEL 7.1 (Docker version 1.4.1-dev, build d26b358/1.4.1).  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Windisch of Docker Inc. for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c2)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 06:22:25 UTC  ```  Created docker tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1206447](show_bug.cgi?id=1206447 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - CVE-2015-1843 docker: regression of CVE-2014-5277 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c3)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 12:58:19 UTC  ``` Since we just shipped or are about to ship docker-1.5, are we all set?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c4)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 13:10:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c3)) > Since we just shipped or are about to ship docker-1.5, are we all set? >  Unfortunately, I don't think so.  Docker Inc. reported it to us as a RHEL specific problem. However, I built a fresh build of 1.5 straight from github that has the same issue, so it's looking more and more like it's their regression and we just consumed it.  I CC'ed you on an e-mail to upstream, but they've yet to comment.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c5)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:22:36 UTC  ``` Trevor, so the basic problem is the failover from https to http correct?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c6)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 13:28:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c5)) > Trevor, so the basic problem is the failover from https to http correct?  Correct. If I "docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel" and 443 doesn't respond, it'll try on 80.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c7)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:29:48 UTC  ``` And docker claims they turned this off?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c8)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:35:19 UTC  ``` Michal can  you take a look at the code around this to make sure we can turn off the fall back between https to http when pulling containers.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c9)  Michal Minar    2015-03-27 14:38:42 UTC  ``` I've just reproduced this. Tested on RHEL7 with a private repository accessible on port 80.  Upstream registry:      $ docker pull miminarnb.virbr0:5004/miminar/hwdata-check     FATA[0004] Error response from daemon: invalid registry endpoint <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v0/>: unable to ping registry endpoint <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v0/>     v2 ping attempt failed with error: Get <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v2/>: EOF     v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v1/_ping>: EOF. If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-registry miminarnb.virbr0:5004` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/miminarnb.virbr0:5004/ca.crt  Current rhatdan/1.6 rhel branch and recent docker builds. - without any additional registry specified, it behaves the same as upstream registry - with --add-registry=miminarnb.virbr0:5004 it pulls the given registry  So I don't think it's an upstream issue but a regression caused by registry patches. I'll investigate further.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c10)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 14:46:55 UTC  ``` Here's what I did with a fresh upstream build (Docker version 1.5.0-dev, build da5c863):  I set modified my /etc/hosts:      127.0.0.1   registry.access.redhat.com  and started a netcat on port 80:      sudo nc -l 80  I then:      sudo ./docker-1.5.0-dev -d  and:      sudo ./docker-1.5.0-dev pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel  The result was fallback to HTTP (from netcat's output):      ...     GET /v2/ HTTP/1.1     Host: registry.access.redhat.com     User-Agent: docker/1.5.0-dev go/go1.4.2 git-commit/da5c863 kernel/3.17.4-301.fc21.x86_64 os/linux arch/amd64     Accept-Encoding: gzip     ...  Given my *and* Michal's case. Perhaps upstream does the right thing initially (with a private repo) but still fails on fallback?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c13)  Michal Minar    2015-03-27 15:27:50 UTC  ``` Trevor, I've just found out why in your case the registry is accessed on port 80:      <https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/registry/config.go#L93>  Localhost is considered insecure by default. I don't think that's a security issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c15)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-28 00:30:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michal Minar from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c13)) > Trevor, > I've just found out why in your case the registry is accessed on port 80: >    >   <https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/registry/config.go#L93> >  > Localhost is considered insecure by default. I don't think that's a security > issue.  You are correct. I just retried using a second machine as the pull target and there was no incorrect fallback.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c19)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-31 13:21:58 UTC  ``` Well the fix will go into docker-1.6, so we should have all of the pull requests there.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c20)  Michal Minar    2015-03-31 14:41:32 UTC  ``` I don't quite follow. This fix is RH only. Upstream is unaffected by this because it doesn't have our registry patches merged and it won't have.  Currently I'm working on rebasing all our work that happened since the last update of PR 10411 on top of it. And I plan to just update the PR with it. I don't see a reason for splitting that into new pull requests - all of them containing also PR 10411 - only to see them being closed later. Am I missing something?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c21)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-31 15:42:54 UTC  ``` Michal the question is whether or not the login process sends the username/passwords intended for  docker.io to registry.access.redhat.com.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c22)  Trevor Jay    2015-04-01 00:14:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c21)) > Michal the question is whether or not the login process sends the > username/passwords intended for  docker.io to registry.access.redhat.com. >  No version I have tested after Michal's patch mid-february sends the credentials. I have confirmed with Docker Inc. that they were testing with docker-1.4.1-37.el7.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c25)  Trevor Jay    2015-04-02 13:51:01 UTC  ``` An expanded explaination of my methodology for testing the HTTP fallback issue:    1) On a second machine or VM with port 80 accessible and *nothing* running on port 443, I run:      sudo nc -l 80    2) On the machine hosting a fresh docker install, add an entry to /etc/hosts:      X.X.X.X registry.access.redhat.com    where X.X.X.X is the IP address of the VM or machine running netcat.    3) I then start docker:      sudo service docker restart    4) And attempt:      sudo docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel  The expected behavior is that the netcat recieves *no* traffic and the pull attempt fails. The problem is still present if any request are received on the running netcat instance.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c26)  Trevor Jay    2015-04-02 13:52:24 UTC  ``` I will now confirm this does not regress the authorization header issue. Once I've done that, I'll provide a quick write-up of the method that worked for me.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c27)  Michal Minar    2015-04-02 14:10:59 UTC  ``` See *Doc Text* field for errata release notes.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c28)  Michal Minar    2015-04-02 14:21:59 UTC  ``` Trevo(In reply to Trevor Jay from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c25)) > An expanded explaination of my methodology for testing the HTTP fallback > issue: >  >   1) On a second machine or VM with port 80 accessible and *nothing* running > on port 443, I run: >   Important note: test with --add-registry=registry.access.redhat.com passed to daemon and then without. It should behave the same.  However with --insecure-registry=registry.access.redhat.com it should fall back to port 80 regardless of --add-registry options.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c29)  Michal Minar    2015-04-02 14:35:29 UTC  ``` And one more thing - test also with unqualified repository:   $ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel  So there's actually 8 combinations:    A I FQ  fall back to port 80?

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0776)

## Topic

Updated docker packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Docker is a service providing container management on Linux.

It was found that the fix for the CVE-2014-5277 issue was incomplete: the
docker client could under certain circumstances erroneously fall back to
HTTP when an HTTPS connection to a registry failed. This could allow a
man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain authentication and image data from
traffic sent from a client to the registry. (CVE-2015-1843)

Red Hat would like to thank Eric Windisch of Docker Inc. for reporting
this issue.

All docker users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c0)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 05:49:33 UTC  ```  A regression of [CVE-2014-5277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5277) was found in the current version of the docker client on RHEL 7.1 (Docker version 1.4.1-dev, build d26b358/1.4.1).  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Windisch of Docker Inc. for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c2)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 06:22:25 UTC  ```  Created docker tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1206447](show_bug.cgi?id=1206447 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - CVE-2015-1843 docker: regression of CVE-2014-5277 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c3)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 12:58:19 UTC  ``` Since we just shipped or are about to ship docker-1.5, are we all set?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c4)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 13:10:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c3)) > Since we just shipped or are about to ship docker-1.5, are we all set? >  Unfortunately, I don't think so.  Docker Inc. reported it to us as a RHEL specific problem. However, I built a fresh build of 1.5 straight from github that has the same issue, so it's looking more and more like it's their regression and we just consumed it.  I CC'ed you on an e-mail to upstream, but they've yet to comment.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c5)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:22:36 UTC  ``` Trevor, so the basic problem is the failover from https to http correct?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c6)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 13:28:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c5)) > Trevor, so the basic problem is the failover from https to http correct?  Correct. If I "docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel" and 443 doesn't respond, it'll try on 80.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c7)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:29:48 UTC  ``` And docker claims they turned this off?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c8)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-27 13:35:19 UTC  ``` Michal can  you take a look at the code around this to make sure we can turn off the fall back between https to http when pulling containers.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c9)  Michal Minar    2015-03-27 14:38:42 UTC  ``` I've just reproduced this. Tested on RHEL7 with a private repository accessible on port 80.  Upstream registry:      $ docker pull miminarnb.virbr0:5004/miminar/hwdata-check     FATA[0004] Error response from daemon: invalid registry endpoint <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v0/>: unable to ping registry endpoint <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v0/>     v2 ping attempt failed with error: Get <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v2/>: EOF     v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get <https://miminarnb.virbr0:5004/v1/_ping>: EOF. If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-registry miminarnb.virbr0:5004` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/miminarnb.virbr0:5004/ca.crt  Current rhatdan/1.6 rhel branch and recent docker builds. - without any additional registry specified, it behaves the same as upstream registry - with --add-registry=miminarnb.virbr0:5004 it pulls the given registry  So I don't think it's an upstream issue but a regression caused by registry patches. I'll investigate further.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c10)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-27 14:46:55 UTC  ``` Here's what I did with a fresh upstream build (Docker version 1.5.0-dev, build da5c863):  I set modified my /etc/hosts:      127.0.0.1   registry.access.redhat.com  and started a netcat on port 80:      sudo nc -l 80  I then:      sudo ./docker-1.5.0-dev -d  and:      sudo ./docker-1.5.0-dev pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel  The result was fallback to HTTP (from netcat's output):      ...     GET /v2/ HTTP/1.1     Host: registry.access.redhat.com     User-Agent: docker/1.5.0-dev go/go1.4.2 git-commit/da5c863 kernel/3.17.4-301.fc21.x86_64 os/linux arch/amd64     Accept-Encoding: gzip     ...  Given my *and* Michal's case. Perhaps upstream does the right thing initially (with a private repo) but still fails on fallback?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c13)  Michal Minar    2015-03-27 15:27:50 UTC  ``` Trevor, I've just found out why in your case the registry is accessed on port 80:      <https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/registry/config.go#L93>  Localhost is considered insecure by default. I don't think that's a security issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c15)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-28 00:30:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michal Minar from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c13)) > Trevor, > I've just found out why in your case the registry is accessed on port 80: >    >   <https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/registry/config.go#L93> >  > Localhost is considered insecure by default.

I just retried using a second machine as the pull target and there was no incorrect fallback.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c19)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-31 13:21:58 UTC  ``` Well the fix will go into docker-1.6, so we should have all of the pull requests there.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c20)  Michal Minar    2015-03-31 14:41:32 UTC  ``` I don't quite follow. This fix is RH only. Upstream is unaffected by this because it doesn't have our registry patches merged and it won't have.  Currently I'm working on rebasing all our work that happened since the last update of PR 10411 on top of it. And I plan to just update the PR with it. I don't see a reason for splitting that into new pull requests - all of them containing also PR 10411 - only to see them being closed later. Am I missing something?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c21)  Daniel Walsh    2015-03-31 15:42:54 UTC  ``` Michal the question is whether or not the login process sends the username/passwords intended for  docker.io to registry.access.redhat.com.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c22)  Trevor Jay    2015-04-01 00:14:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c21)) > Michal the question is whether or not the login process sends the > username/passwords intended for  docker.io to registry.access.redhat.com. >  No version I have tested after Michal's patch mid-february sends the credentials.

The problem is still present if any request are received on the running netcat instance.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c26)  Trevor Jay    2015-04-02 13:52:24 UTC  ``` I will now confirm this does not regress the authorization header issue.

It should behave the same.  However with --insecure-registry=registry.access.redhat.com it should fall back to port 80 regardless of --add-registry options.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1206443#c29)  Michal Minar    2015-04-02 14:35:29 UTC  ``` And one more thing - test also with unqualified repository:   $ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel  So there's actually 8 combinations:    A I FQ  fall back to port 80?
