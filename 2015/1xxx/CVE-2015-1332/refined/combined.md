## Details

It was discovered that the DOM tree could be corrupted during parsing in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same-origin restrictions or cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1291](/security/CVE-2015-1291))

An issue was discovered in NavigatorServiceWorker::serviceWorker in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1292](/security/CVE-2015-1292))

An issue was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1293](/security/CVE-2015-1293))

A use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1294](/security/CVE-2015-1294))

A use-after-free was discovered in the shared-timer implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1299](/security/CVE-2015-1299))

It was discovered that the availability of iframe Resource Timing API

times was not properly restricted in some circumstances. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-1300](/security/CVE-2015-1300))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1301](/security/CVE-2015-1301))

A heap corruption issue was discovered in oxide::JavaScriptDialogManager.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1332](/security/CVE-2015-1332))

restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1292](/security/CVE-2015-1292))

An issue was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1293](/security/CVE-2015-1293))

A use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1294](/security/CVE-2015-1294))

A use-after-free was discovered in the shared-timer implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1299](/security/CVE-2015-1299))

It was discovered that the availability of iframe Resource Timing API

times was not properly restricted in some circumstances. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-1300](/security/CVE-2015-1300))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1301](/security/CVE-2015-1301))

A heap corruption issue was discovered in oxide::JavaScriptDialogManager.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an
