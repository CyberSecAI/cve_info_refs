  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-1696",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Windows Journal parses Journal files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper parsing of file formats",
        "Remote code execution"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. With administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, modifying data, and creating new accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: Sending a specially crafted Journal file to a user and convincing them to open it."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious .jnt file and the capability to trick the victim into opening the crafted file.",
      "affected_systems": [
        "Windows Vista Service Pack 2",
        "Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
        "Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 2",

        "Windows RT 8.1"
      ],
       "additional_notes": "The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows Journal parses Journal files. The vulnerability is present only if Windows Journal is installed, which may not be the case by default on certain server operating systems unless the Desktop Experience or Ink and Handwriting Services feature are enabled."
