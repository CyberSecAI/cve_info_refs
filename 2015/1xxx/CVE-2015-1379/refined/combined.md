When   a signal is triggered while the process is within a non   async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non   sync-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this   situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries,   and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash.   Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork   option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.  Testcase   none  Affected versions   1.0.0.0 - 1.7.2.4   2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b7  Not affected or corrected versions   1.7.3.0 and later   2.0.0-b8 (to be released) and later  Workaround   none  Download   The updated sources can be downloaded from:      <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/download/socat-1.7.3.0.tar.gz>  Credits    Credits to Peter Lobsinger   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1185711#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-27 09:10:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1185942](show_bug.cgi?id=1185942 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - socat: possible denial of service with fork") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1185711#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-01-28 10:18:48 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2015-1379](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1379) to this issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/284>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1185711#c3)  Vincent Danen    2015-05-08 19:56:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

### Recent Releases

2024-12-11: Socat [version 1.8.0.2](download/socat-1.8.0.2.tar.gz) has been released. It fixes an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability in readline.sh ([Socat security advisory 9](contrib/socat-secadv9.html), CVE-2024-54661)

2024-08-24: Socat [version 1.8.0.1](download/socat-1.8.0.1.tar.gz) has been released. It fixes a couple of regressions in version 1.8.0.0 (see below), and a few other minor issues, see file <CHANGES>

#### Failures report for 1.8.0.0

A group of failures in Socat version 1.8.0.0 have been reported for commands that worked fine in previous versions (regression). They affect addresses using IP protocols without explicit IP version, with options bind and/or range.
Examples are TCP-LISTEN, UDP, UDP-RECV, OPENSSL.
The error messages are:

* E syntax error in "localhost"
* E syntax error in range "127.0.0.1/8" of unspecified address family: use <addr>:<mask>
* E xioopen\_ipdgram\_listen(): unknown address family 0
* E getaddrinfo("127.0.0.1", "NULL", {0x01,10,2,17}, {}): Address family for hostname not supported
* E xioparsenetwork\_ip6("localhost:255.255.255.255",,): missing mask bits delimiter '/'
* E missing brackets for IPv6 range definition "127.0.0.1/8"

These issues will be addressed by version 1.8.0.1, planned for **August**; possible workarounds are:

* Use Socat up to version 1.7.4.4 (or 1.7.4.5 from git)
* Apply option -4 (does not help in some cases)
* Use explicit IP version in address key word like TCP4-LISTEN, UDP4 etc;
* Add address option pf=ip4 (esp.with OPENSSL)

2023-11-13: Socat [version 1.8.0.0](download/socat-1.8.0.0.tar.gz) has been released. It adds a couple of new features:

* Support for **network namespaces** ([option netns](doc/socat.html#OPTION_NETNS))
* TCP client now automatically **tries all addresses** (IPv4 and IPv6) provided by nameserver until success
* Implementation of **POSIX message queue** (mq) control and access on Linux ([addresses POSIXMQ-READ and following](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_POSIXMQ_READ))
* New wrapper script socat-chain.sh allows to **stack two addresses**, e.g.HTTP proxy connect over SSL
* New script socat-mux.sh allows **n-to-1 / 1-to-n communications**
* New script socat-broker.sh allows **group communications**
* Experimental [**socks5 client**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SOCKS5_CONNECT) feature
* Address [ACCEPT-FD](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_ACCEPT_FD) for **systemd "inetd" mode**
* [**UDP-Lite**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_UDP6_RECV) and [**DCCP**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_DCCP_CONNECT) address types
* Addresses [**SOCKETPAIR**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SOCKETPAIR) and [**SHELL**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SHELL)* New [option bind-tmpname](doc/socat.html#OPTION_UNIX_BIND_TEMPNAME) allows forked off children to **bind UNIX** domain client sockets to random **unique pathes**
  * New [option retrieve-vlan](doc/socat.html#OPTION_RETRIEVE_VLAN) (with INTERFACE addresses) now makes kernel **keep VLAN tags** in incoming packets
  * Simple **statistics output** with [Socat option --statistics](doc/socat.html#option_statistics) and with SIGUSR1
  * A couple of new options, many fixes and corrections, see file <CHANGES>

**Notes to distribution maintainers and packagers:**

* Socat now installs as socat1, and a symlink socat points to it, same with man page
* test.sh now provides option "--expect-fail 123,216" to gain rc=0 even with some failures

## History

2022-01-08: Socat [version 1.7.4.3](download/socat-1.7.4.3.tar.gz) fixes the TCP\_INFO issue that broke building on non-Linux platforms. Furthermore, building on AIX works again. A few more corrections and improvements have been added.

2021-10-31: Socat [version 1.7.4.2](download/socat-1.7.4.2.tar.gz) fixes a lot of bugs, e.g., for options -r and -R.

2021-01-10: Socat [version 1.7.4.1](download/Archive/socat-1.7.4.1.tar.gz) fixes compilation on 32 bit systems and file transfer with OpenSSL.

2021-01-04: Socat [version 1.7.4.0](download/Archive/socat-1.7.4.0.tar.gz) fixes a couple of bugs including a very theoretical security issue, restauration of DTLS using UDP, some porting issues, and last but not least several new features: VSOCK support, OpenSSL SNI, raw data dump, and more. See file [CHANGES](doc/CHANGES) and [Release Notes](doc/RELEASE-NOTES-1.7.4.0).

Subject: Socat security advisory 6 - Possible DoS with fork (update: CVE-Id:
 CVE-2015-1379; fix for version 2)

Socat security advisory 6 - Possible DoS with fork

Overview
  socats signal handler implementations are not async-signal-safe and
  can cause crash or freeze of socat processes

Vulnerability Id: CVE-2015-1379.

Severity: Low

Details
  Socats signal handler implementations are not asnyc-signal-safe. When
  a signal is triggered while the process is within a non
  async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non
  sync-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this
  situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries,
  and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash.
  Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork
  option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.

Testcase
  none

Affected versions
  1.0.0.0 - 1.7.2.4
  2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b7

Not affected or corrected versions
  1.7.3.0 and later
  2.0.0-b8 and later

Workaround
  none
