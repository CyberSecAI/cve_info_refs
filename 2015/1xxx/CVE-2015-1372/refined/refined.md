Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1372, as described in the various sources:

**Root Cause:**
The ferretCMS v.1.0.4-alpha has insecure coding practices in its administrative backend leading to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the `action` parameter of `admin.php`.
    *   An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the URL, which gets executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted link.

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The CMS logs login attempts, including usernames. An attacker can inject JavaScript code as a username, which is then stored in the logs and executed when an administrator views the logs.
    *   Another stored XSS vulnerability is in the page title of blog entries. An attacker can inject JavaScript code in the page title field, which will be executed when the page is viewed.

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in various `admin.php` pages.
    *   The `p` parameter of these pages is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries via the `p` parameter to extract sensitive data (database version, database name, user information), or potentially modify the database content.

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   The CMS has a file upload functionality in the administrative backend that allows administrators to upload any file type.
    *   Uploaded files are stored in a predictable location and are accessible by unauthenticated users.
    *   Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP backdoors) and execute them, gaining control of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other client-side attacks targeting administrators.
*   **Stored XSS:** Can lead to persistent attacks against administrators, who will execute malicious code each time they view the logs or blog pages, potentially leading to privilege escalation or server takeover.
*   **SQL Injection:** Can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, and potentially modify data or gain full access to the database server.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Complete server compromise by executing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Attacker sends a crafted URL to a victim. The victim executes the script by visiting the link.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers inject malicious code through forms (login form or blog post form) that is then stored and executed by other users.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attacker manipulates the vulnerable URL parameter with SQL injection payloads.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Attacker uploads a malicious file using the upload form, then accesses the file directly through the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on a malicious URL (reflected) or simply wait for a user to view a stored malicious payload.
*   **SQLi:** The attacker can target any user of the application. 
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   To upload the file, the attacker would need administrator-level access to the CMS.
    *   However, any user, authenticated or not, can execute the uploaded files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The software was in the alpha stage of development at the time of discovery, so it was expected to have vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was contacted and intended to patch the issues.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on Jan 15-16, 2015. The vendor was informed on Jan 16th, 2015. The advisory with technical details was released on January 22nd, 2015.
*   The vulnerabilities were found in ferretCMS v.1.0.4-alpha.
