Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an open redirect issue found in the `meta2.php` script of u5CMS.
*   The script takes input from the `uri` GET parameter and potentially from the `pidvesa` cookie.
*   The script fails to properly validate or sanitize these inputs before using them in a redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is an open redirect, which allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The software doesn't properly validate the `uri` parameter and `pidvesa` cookie, leading to the injection of malicious URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can trick users into visiting a malicious website by crafting a link with the desired redirect URL. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the `uri` parameter containing a target URL for redirection. Example: `meta2.php?uri=http://malicious.site`
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The advisory also mentions the use of the `pidvesa` cookie, suggesting that manipulation of this cookie may also be used to achieve open redirection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending crafted links to users.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** No user authentication or special privileges are necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely need to employ some form of social engineering to convince a user to click on the crafted link.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** u5CMS versions 3.9.3 and 3.9.2 are vulnerable.
*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor was notified and released version 3.9.4 to address the vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC is available in the `u5cms_url.txt` file, which is referenced in the advisory.
*   **CVE ID:**  The vulnerability is identified by CVE-2015-1578
