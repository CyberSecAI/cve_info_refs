Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Plasma ScreenLocker daemon (ksld) manages input events while the screen is locked. Although ksld grabs keyboard and mouse input to prevent other X11 clients from reading it, a flaw allows any X11 client to bypass this protection and access all input events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The primary vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of input event handling within the `ksld` process. It fails to properly isolate input events meant for the screen locker from other X11 clients.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** There are inadequate access control mechanisms in place to prevent X11 clients from eavesdropping on input events while the screen is locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Sniffing:** A malicious or compromised application with access to the X server can eavesdrop on a user's keyboard input, including passwords, while the screen is locked.
*   **Data Exposure:** Any other sensitive data entered while the screen is locked (e.g., personal information, PINs) could also be captured.
*   **Local and Remote Exploitation:** This can be exploited both locally by an application running as a different user and remotely by applications that are connected to the X server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Local Application:** A malicious application running on the same system with access to the X server can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Remote X11 Client:** A compromised or malicious remote application connected to the X server can also leverage this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **X Server Access:** The attacker needs to have a running X11 client application that can connect to the X server.
*   **No elevated privileges required**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `kde-workspace` versions >= 4.2.0 and in `plasma-workspace` versions < 5.1.95.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" risk but can still lead to serious security breaches such as password compromise.
*   Workarounds include not allowing X11 clients from other user accounts or remote X11 clients to connect to the X server, or using the "Screen saver" locker type instead of the default "Simple locker" in kde-workspace. Disabling screen locking would also avoid this vulnerability.
*   The fix is available in Plasma 5.1.95 and also through the provided patch.
