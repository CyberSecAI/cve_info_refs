This page serves as additional explanatory text and examples related to the security advisory [Identity Provider and OpenSAML-J PKIX Trust Engines Exhibit Critical Flaw In Trusted Names Evaluation](http://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20150225.txt).

To make the examples clearer, parts of the XML not relevant to illustrating the problem, such as non-relevant element content and namespace declarations, will be omitted.

# SAML Metadata Problem Example

This SAML metadata example illustrates the starting problematic case.

**SAML Metadata with vulnerable EntityDescriptors**
```
<!-- The top-level entities group containing globally-scoped key authorities. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="allEntities">

  <!-- All entities within this EntitiesDescriptor are within the scope of these key authorities. -->
  <md:Extensions>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
  </md:Extensions>

  <!-- This entity has only a KeyName and uses the PKIX trust model. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example1.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example1.org</ds:KeyName>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It also has a KeyName.  It is not vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example2.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example2.org</ds:KeyName>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It does not have a KeyName and is therefore vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example3.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```

In the example above, entity `https://www.example3.org` does not contain a `KeyName` and may be impersonated by anyone with a certificate issued by one of the CA's enumerated by the `KeyAuthority` elements.

# Mitigation Approaches

The best mitigation is to upgrade the IdP to version 2.4.4 or greater.

If upgrading the software is not possible, then there are several mitigation approaches: one involving disabling all PKIX trust engines and several involving editing and/or restructuring of the metadata.

## Approach 1: Disable PKIX trust engines

This approach involves changing the IdP's configuration to disable use of PKIX trust engines.  Do this **ONLY** if it is known that the IdP does not need to interact with any SP's whose trust is established based on the PKIX trust model, or if temporary loss of access to such SP's is acceptable.

The IdP ships with the following default `TrustEngine` configuration in relying-party.xml:

**Default IdP trust engine configuration in relying-party.xml**
```

<security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:SignatureChaining">
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureMetadataExplicitKeyTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataExplicitKeySignature" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureMetadataPKIXTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataPKIXSignature" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
</security:TrustEngine>

<security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:Chaining">
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialMetadataExplictKeyTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataExplicitKey" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialMetadataPKIXTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataPKIXX509Credential" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
</security:TrustEngine>

```

The configuration would be modified to remove or comment out the the 2 `-MetadataPKIX-` `TrustEngine` elements as follows:

**relying-party.xml configuration with PKIX trust engines disabled**
```
 <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:SignatureChaining">
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureMetadataExplicitKeyTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataExplicitKeySignature" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  <!-- This trust engine is commented out and disabled
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.SignatureMetadataPKIXTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataPKIXSignature" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  -->
</security:TrustEngine>

<security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:Chaining">
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialMetadataExplictKeyTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataExplicitKey" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  <!-- This trust engine is commented out and disabled
  <security:TrustEngine id="shibboleth.CredentialMetadataPKIXTrustEngine" xsi:type="security:MetadataPKIXX509Credential" metadataProviderRef="ShibbolethMetadata"/>
  -->
</security:TrustEngine>
```

Unless configuration reloading of relying-party.xml is enabled, the IdP will need to be restarted for this change to take effect.

## Approach 2: Add KeyNames for all entities

This approach involves ensuring that all entities have at least one `KeyName` for every `KeyDescriptor` that they contain.

**Vulnerable entity with KeyName added**
```
 <!-- The top-level entities group containing globally-scoped key authorities. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="allEntities">

  <!-- All entities within this EntitiesDescriptor are within the scope of these key authorities. -->
  <md:Extensions>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
  </md:Extensions>

  <!-- For clarity, other entities not shown.  -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example1.org/sp"> ... </md:EntityDescriptor>
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example2.org/sp"> ... </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       A KeyName has been added and it is no longer vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example3.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example3.org</ds:KeyName>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```
## Approach 3: Split the metadata

This approach involves splitting the metadata source document into 2 distinct documents: 1) one containing the `KeyAuthority` elements and any entities which rely on the PKIX model 2) one containing no `KeyAuthority` elements and only entities which rely on the explicit key model only.  A new metadata provider is then defined which consumes the new PKIX-only metadata source document.

**Original source: Non-PKIX entities**
```
<!-- KeyAuthority elements removed, and only entities using the explicit key model. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="nonPKIXEntities">

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It also has a KeyName.  It is not vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example2.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example2.org</ds:KeyName>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It does not have a KeyName but is no longer vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example3.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```
**New source: PKIX Entities**
```
 <!-- The top-level entities group containing globally-scoped key authorities. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="pkixEntities">

  <!-- All entities within this EntitiesDescriptor are within the scope of these key authorities. -->
  <md:Extensions>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
    <shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
  </md:Extensions>

  <!-- This entity has only a KeyName and uses the PKIX trust model. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example1.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example1.org</ds:KeyName>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```
## Approach 4: Move PKIX entities to a dedicated group

This approach involves moving the entities which rely on the PKIX trust model to a dedicated `EntitiesDescriptor`, along with the relevant `KeyAuthority` elements.  This "scopes" the `KeyAuthority` elements so that they only apply to those entities which are descendents of their owning `EntitiesDescriptor`.

**Mixed entities with group**
```
<!-- The top-level entities group containing mixed entities.  There are no global key authorities. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="allEntities">

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It also has a KeyName.  It is not vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example2.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example2.org</ds:KeyName>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It does not have a KeyName but is no longer vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example3.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- New entities group containing only entities which use the PKIX model, along with the relevant key authorities. -->
  <md:EntitiesDescriptor name="pkixEntities">

 	<!-- All entities within this EntitiesDescriptor are within the scope of these key authorities. -->
  	<md:Extensions>
    	<shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
    	<shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
  	</md:Extensions>

  	<!-- This entity has only a KeyName and uses the PKIX trust model. -->
  	<md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example1.org/sp">
    	<md:SPSSODescriptor>
      		<md:KeyDescriptor>
				<ds:KeyInfo>
					<ds:KeyName>www.example1.org</ds:KeyName>
				</ds:KeyInfo>
      		</md:KeyDescriptor>
    	</md:SPSSODescriptor>
  	</md:EntityDescriptor>

  </md:EntitiesDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```
## Approach 5: Move KeyAuthority elements down to individual entities

This approach involves moving/copying the `KeyAuthority` extensions down to appear under each `EntityDescriptor` which uses the PKIX model.

**Mixed entities with individual KeyAuthority extensions**
```
<!-- The top-level entities group containing mixed entities.  There are no global key authorities. -->
<md:EntitiesDescriptor name="allEntities">

  <!-- This entity has only a KeyName and uses the PKIX trust model. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example1.org/sp">

	 <!-- Only the parent EntityDescriptor is within the scope of these key authorities. -->
  	<md:Extensions>
    	<shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
    	<shibmd:KeyAuthority> ... </shibmd:KeyAuthority>
  	</md:Extensions>

	 <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example1.org</ds:KeyName>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It also has a KeyName.  It is not vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example2.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:KeyName>www.example2.org</ds:KeyName>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
      </md:KeyDescriptor>
    </md:SPSSODescriptor>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

  <!-- This entity has a key specified by an X509Data element for use with the explicit key model.
       It does not have a KeyName but is no longer vulnerable to this issue. -->
  <md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://www.example3.org/sp">
    <md:SPSSODescriptor>
      <md:KeyDescriptor>
		<ds:KeyInfo>
			<ds:X509Data> ... </ds:X509Data>
		</ds:KeyInfo>
  </md:EntityDescriptor>

 </md:EntitiesDescriptor>
```

# RHSA-2015:1177 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

The following security issues are resolved with this update:

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
Portal are advised to apply this update.

Shibboleth Security Advisory [ 25 February 2015 ]
Identity Provider and OpenSAML-J PKIX Trust Engines Exhibit
Critical Flaw In Trusted Names Evaluation
=======================================================================
A critical flaw has been discovered in the PKIX trust components of
the Shibboleth Identity Provider and OpenSAML Java that allows a
candidate X509 credential to be trusted in the special case where no
trusted names are available for the candidate entityID. A software
upgrade and/or changes to consumed SAML metadata is required to
mitigate the issue.
The Shibboleth Identity Provider and OpenSAML Java support a PKIX
model for establishing trust of an entityID's X509 certificate
(Credential), by establishing that the entity's certificate is signed
by a trusted authority. A crucial part of this trust model is
ensuring that one or more of the certificate's names (e.g. subject
common name (CN), subject alternative name extension) is a "trusted
name" known to be valid for the entity based on a trusted source of
information, such as SAML Metadata.
A critical flaw has been discovered in the PKIX trust components that
allows an X509 credential to be trusted in the special case where no
trusted names are available for the given entityID.
With the Shibboleth SAML Metadata-based PKIX trust model and the use
of shibmd:KeyAuthority elements representing trust anchors, this
condition exists when an entity has no KeyName elements in its
RoleDescriptor's KeyDescriptor. This is a potentially common
condition, since many entities publish only a certificate in their
metadata; in these cases their trust is typically established via the
alternative "explicit key" model.
The practical result of this flaw is that if the IdP has a
metadata-based PKIX trust engine enabled, anyone in possession of a
certificate issued by one of the shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchors may
impersonate any entity described in that metadata within the scope of
that shibmd:KeyAuthority which does not contain at least one KeyName
in its RoleDescriptor's KeyDescriptor.
The Shibboleth IdP ships with metadata-based PKIX trust engines
enabled by default. In relying-party.xml, the security:TrustEngine
elements with id values of 'shibboleth.SignatureTrustEngine' and
'shibboleth.CredentialTrustEngine' by default are defined as a
chaining engine consisting of a MetadataExplicityKey- engine followed
by a MetadataPKIX- engine. The MetadataPKIX- engines are vulnerable to
this flaw.
Affected Versions
=================
Versions of OpenSAML Java < 2.6.5
Versions of the Identity Provider < 2.4.4
Recommendations
===============
OpenSAML users: Upgrade to OpenSAML Java 2.6.5 or greater, if PKIX
trust engines are in use. PKIX trust engine implementations in this
version will fail a candidate credential if no trusted names are
resolved for the relevant entityID; the existing PKIX resolver
implementations now also automatically treat the target entityID as an
implicit trusted name. If this is not feasible, ensure that ALL entity
data resolved via instances of PKIXValidationInformationResolver have
at least 1 trusted name which is resolveable. For resolvers based on
SAML metadata, see IdP recommendations below.
IdP users: Upgrade to IdP 2.4.4 or greater, if PKIX trust engines are
in use. PKIX trust engine implementations in this version will fail a
candidate credential if no trusted names are resolved for the relevant
entityID; the existing PKIX resolver implementations now also
automatically treat the target entityID as an implicit trusted name.
If this is not feasible:
For any configured StaticPKIX- trust engines, ensure that they are
configured with at least 1 TrustedName child element.
For all configured MetadataPKIX- trust engines: Only metadata sources
which contain Shibboleth KeyAuthority extensions are affected by this
flaw. Metadata which does not contain KeyAuthority extensions is not
effectively usable with the PKIX trust model in general. If
examination of the relevant source metadata shows no KeyAuthority
elements present, then that particular MetadataPKIX- engine instance
is not susceptible to this issue.
If KeyAuthority elements ARE present in the relevant metadata:
If the metadata in use with a MetadataPKIX- trust engine is local
and/or under the IdP's control, one approach for remediation is to
ensure that all RoleDescriptors (in particular SPSSODescriptors)
represented and within the scope of a KeyAuthority have at least 1
KeyName within their KeyDescriptor elements containing a key name,
EVEN IF that entity's KeyDescriptor already contains a key (e.g. an
X509Data/X509Certificate element) used with the "explicit key" trust
model.
If metadata in use with a MetadataPKIX- trust engine is not under the
control of the IdP (e.g. is published by a federation), the federation
or publisher would need to take the necessary steps outlined above to
ensure that all RoleDescriptors have at least 1 KeyDescriptor/KeyName.
In the above case an IdP deployer may of course chose to disable
MetadataPKIX- trust engines until such time as the consumed metadata
meets these requirements.
For both cases, an alternative approach would be to restrict the scope
of the KeyAuthority extensions to particular EntityDescriptors and/or
EntitiesDescriptor groups.
This may be implemented by one of the following methods:
1) Define a distinct MetadataProvider and associated MetadataPKIX-
trust engine based on this new metadata source, and move all
EntityDescriptors using PKIX and their KeyAuthority extensions to this
new source.
2) Create a dedicated EntitiesDescriptor group within the existing
metadata and move the KeyAuthority extensions and EntityDescriptors
which use the PKIX model to this EntitiesDescriptor group.
3) Copy relevant KeyAuthority extensions down to individual
EntityDescriptor elements, and then remove them from the ancestor
EntitiesDescriptor.
Examples of these approaches are available in the Shibboleth wiki at:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2015:1176 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that the JClouds scriptbuilder Statements class writes a temporary file to a predictable location. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive data, denial of service, or other attacks. (CVE-2014-4651)

It was found that SSLSocket in Smack did not perform hostname verification. An attacker could redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control. (CVE-2014-5075)

It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.
