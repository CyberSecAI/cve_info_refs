Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in ferretCMS v1.0.4-alpha:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in various parts of the administrative backend. This leads to XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows administrators to upload arbitrary files without proper sanitization and stores them in a publicly accessible directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `action` in `admin.php`
    *   Attack vector: Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the `action` parameter.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable input fields: Username field in login form, pagetitle field in new blog post form.
    *   Attack vector: Malicious JavaScript code inserted into these fields. Code is then executed when the data is displayed.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `p` parameter in various `admin.php` actions (site, customkey, account, plugin, template, permissiongroup, page updates).
    *   Attack vector: Crafted `p` parameter with malicious SQL code.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   Vulnerable URL: `/admin.php?type=uploader&action=upload`
    *   Attack vector: Uploading arbitrary files, including malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive database information, modify data, or potentially take control of the database server.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary files, leading to complete compromise of the web server. This can be used to gain remote code execution, upload a web shell, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Requires a user to click on a maliciously crafted link containing the exploit code.
*   **Stored XSS:** Requires an attacker to inject malicious code through vulnerable input fields. The exploit is triggered when the stored data is displayed to other users or administrators.
*   **SQLi:** Requires an attacker to craft a malicious SQL query within the vulnerable URL parameters.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Requires an attacker to access the file upload form (typically administrator access) and upload malicious files. The attacker may then be able to access the file through a known path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**  Requires an attacker to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
*   **Stored XSS:** Requires an attacker to interact with the application, either with administrator or user privileges, depending on the vulnerable field used.
*   **SQLi:** Requires the attacker to identify a vulnerable URL parameter. No specific privileges are necessarily needed.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Requires an attacker to have administrator privileges to access the upload form. Once uploaded, the attacker needs to know the path to the uploaded file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The software is in alpha development stage.
*   The file upload vulnerability allows for arbitrary file uploads and does not rename the uploaded files.
*   Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory `/custom/uploads/`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Steffen RÃ¶semann.
*   The vendor was informed and is planning to patch the vulnerabilities.
