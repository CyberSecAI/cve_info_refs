Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The exploit leverages three distinct vulnerabilities present in Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager:
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** Allows bypassing authentication mechanisms.
2.  **Directory Traversal:** Permits access to files and directories outside of the intended web application's root directory.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Enables the attacker to execute code with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authentication:** The application has an authentication bypass vulnerability allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Path Traversal:** The application is susceptible to directory traversal which can allow the attacker to access sensitive locations on the file system.
*   **Insecure Code Execution:** The application can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation leads to:
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker gains a remote shell as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, granting complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit utilizes HTTP POST requests to interact with the vulnerable application.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The exploit obtains and uses cookies to authenticate and maintain a session.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads an executable payload and a JSP file to the webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the target Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it using Metasploit.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit utilizes a Metasploit module.
*   The exploit uploads a payload (meterpreter) and a jsp file to the server to execute the payload
*   The exploit targets Windows systems.
*   The vulnerabilities are associated with CVE-2015-1486, CVE-2015-1487, and CVE-2015-1489.
