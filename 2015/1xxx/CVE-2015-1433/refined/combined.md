Category: security (moderate) Bug References: 863569,915789 CVE References: CVE-2015-1433 Sources used: openSUSE 13.2 (src):    roundcubemail-1.0.5-8.1 openSUSE 13.1 (src):    roundcubemail-1.0.5-2.18.1 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=915789#c6)  James Carter   2015-03-12 01:25:14 UTC  ``` Today 03-11 on OpenSuSE 13.1 (i586) we installed patch openSUSE-SU-2015:0286-1 from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=915789#c5).  It was not exactly trauma-free.       The patch would not apply because it wanted php-pear-Net_Sieve.  SBS has php5-pear-Net_Sieve, and putting this in my local repo allowed roundcubemail-1.0.5-2.18.1.noarch to be installed.       After the upgrade, users could log in to Roundcube, but when showing the message list it would show one to three messages and then just sit there with the "Loading..." circulator.  I didn't find any error messages that seemed relevant.  Users gathered outside the bugs office with pitchforks.       Now, how are we going to revert?  Fast?  I just installed the old package, but there was considerable mess to clean up.  I didn't document in detail which step caused what problem, but the main issue was that one of the install steps transformed /etc/roundcubemail/main.inc.php and db.inc.php, in particular changing the database URL from  $config['db_dsnw'] = 'pgsql://webmail:qw%2Ferty@localhost/roundcube'; to rcmail_config['db_dsnw'] = 'mysql://roundcube:pass@localhost/roundcubemail'; which appears to be the generic configuration for a new installation.       I restored the old config files, restored the database (since in the major version upgrade the schema got updated, not likely backward compatible), and it came back to life.       Moral: if you're going to install this patch, treat it as a full version upgrade, don't just let zypper install the thing. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=915789#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2015-07-06 12:00:52 UTC  ``` update released ``` |  |
