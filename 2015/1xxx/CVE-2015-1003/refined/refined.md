Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of external input when constructing file paths. Specifically, the software doesn't adequately neutralize special characters within pathnames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing for traversal beyond the intended directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful attack allows a malicious actor to read arbitrary files from the operating system where the affected application is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Path Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates external input used in constructing file paths, using special characters or sequences (like "..") to navigate the file system outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates that an attacker with low skill could exploit this vulnerability.
