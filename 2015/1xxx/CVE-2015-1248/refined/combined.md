### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3334 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3334)

#### Description

browser/ui/website\_settings/website\_settings.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always display "Media: Allowed by you" in a Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission to a web site, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that turns on the camera at a time when the user believes that camera access is prohibited.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium.(CVE-2015-1235, CVE-2015-1236, CVE-2015-1237, CVE-2015-1238,
CVE-2015-1240, CVE-2015-1241, CVE-2015-1242, CVE-2015-1244, CVE-2015-1245,
CVE-2015-1246, CVE-2015-1247, CVE-2015-1248, CVE-2015-1249)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 42.0.2311.90, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/04/stable-channel-update_14.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, April 14, 2015

The Chrome team is overjoyed to announce the promotion of Chrome 42 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 42.0.2311.90 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps, extension and Web Platform APIs (including the [Push API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/tip/index.html)!)
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance
* The answer to [life, the universe and everything](https://www.google.com/search?&q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything&gws_rd=ssl)

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/41.0.2272.0..42.0.2311.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [45 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M42&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[476786](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476786)] CVE-2015-1249: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.2 branch (currently 4.2.77.14).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
