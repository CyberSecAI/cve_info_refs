Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Fortinet FortiClient mobile applications:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The Android application uses a hardcoded string ("FoRtInEt!AnDrOiD") as the encryption key for sensitive data stored in shared preferences.
*   **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:** Both Android and iOS applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when connecting to VPN servers and endpoint control servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The use of a static, easily discoverable key for encrypting sensitive data.
*   **Insufficient SSL Certificate Validation:** Lack of proper validation of SSL certificates, allowing for MITM attacks. This is exacerbated in the iOS version where no warning is given to the user, even with the check server certificate option enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** An attacker can decrypt sensitive information, such as stored passwords, from the shared preferences of the Android application. This is a global issue, as the key is the same for all instances of the application.
*  **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:**  An attacker performing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept and steal sensitive information, including SSL VPN credentials and mobile device details, by presenting a malicious SSL certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The attacker needs to decompile the Android application to extract the hardcoded encryption key and have access to the encrypted shared preferences data.
*   **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:** The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MITM attack on the network traffic between the FortiClient application and the server (VPN or endpoint control).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** Requires the ability to decompile the Android application and access to the device's shared preference files.
*   **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:** Requires the ability to intercept network traffic between the FortiClient application and the server, which usually means being on the same network as the victim or controlling a network hop.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Android version displays a warning prompt when the SSL VPN server's certificate is not trusted, but this does not prevent the MITM attack if a user proceeds past the warning. The iOS version does not display any warnings.
*   The Endpoint Control protocol (TCP port 8010) also lacks SSL certificate validation.
*   The advisory mentions that these vulnerabilities affect FortiClient iOS v5.2.028 and FortiClient Android 5.2.3.091
