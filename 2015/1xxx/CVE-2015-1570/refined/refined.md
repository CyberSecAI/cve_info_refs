The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Fortinet FortiClient mobile applications (iOS and Android).

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The FortiClient applications (both iOS and Android) do not properly validate SSL certificates when connecting to SSL VPN servers or for the Endpoint Control protocol.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper SSL certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting sensitive information such as SSL VPN credentials and mobile device details. The Android version displays a warning prompt when the server certificate is not trusted but the iOS version does not, regardless of the "check server certificate" option being enabled or not.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Man-in-the-Middle attack.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic between the FortiClient application and the server and host their own SSL server with a self-signed certificate.

2.  **Hardcoded Encryption Keys:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The Android application uses a hardcoded private string "FoRtInEt!AnDrOiD" as the encryption key.
    *   **Weakness:** Usage of a hardcoded encryption key for encrypting sensitive data stored within the app's Shared Preferences.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can extract the hardcoded key from the application using decompilation. This key can be used to decrypt encrypted passwords from any FortiClient instance globally.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Reverse engineering of the Android application.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to decompile the Android application.

**Affected Versions:**
*   FortiClient iOS v5.2.028
*   FortiClient Android 5.2.3.091
