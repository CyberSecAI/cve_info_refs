Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1360:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability relates to missing context flushing in Skia's text rendering when drawing text as paths. This issue was identified in `GrBitmapTextContext.cpp` and `GrDistanceFieldTextContext.cpp`, and a fix was implemented by flushing the text contexts before drawing text as a path.

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper flushing of text contexts in Skia before drawing text as paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   The vulnerability is present in how Skia handles text rendering, specifically when text is rendered as paths.
-   The code was not flushing the text context prior to converting it to a path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided information does not specify the exact impact of this vulnerability, but it does state it could lead to unspecified impact.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that this could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) or other unspecified impacts, suggesting that this could cause unexpected behavior or crashes during text rendering.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered during the process of drawing text as a path in Skia.
-   The specific steps needed for exploitation are not detailed. It can be inferred that by forcing the code to render text as paths without proper context flushing, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need to find a way to make the application use the vulnerable code path of drawing text as a path in Skia. This means the attacker would need to be able to control the content or manipulate the text that is rendered.
-   The attacker would likely need to target an application using the Skia library and be able to render text using the affected functions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code review diffs show a fix was implemented by adding calls to flush text contexts in `src/gpu/GrBitmapTextContext.cpp` and `src/gpu/GrDistanceFieldTextContext.cpp`.
-   The fix was committed to Skia, and the related Chromium update addressed this vulnerability.
