Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/01/stable-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, January 21, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 40 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 40.0.2214.91 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* Updated info dialog for Chrome app on Windows and Linux.
* A new clock behind/ahead error message.

A partial list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/39.0.2171.0..40.0.2214.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [62 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M40&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank *Atte Kettunen of OUSPG, Christian Holler, cloudfuzzer and Khalil Zhani* for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $35000 in additional rewards were issued.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes

* [[449894](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=449894)] CVE-2015-1205: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 3.30 branch (currently 3.30.33.15).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
