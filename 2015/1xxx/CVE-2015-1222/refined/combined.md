## Details

Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2015-1213](/security/CVE-2015-1213), [CVE-2015-1214](/security/CVE-2015-1214), [CVE-2015-1215](/security/CVE-2015-1215))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-1216](/security/CVE-2015-1216))

Multiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1217](/security/CVE-2015-1217), [CVE-2015-1230](/security/CVE-2015-1230))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1218](/security/CVE-2015-1218), [CVE-2015-1223](/security/CVE-2015-1223))

An integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2015-1219](/security/CVE-2015-1219))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2015-1220](/security/CVE-2015-1220))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2015-1221](/security/CVE-2015-1221))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker

implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these

to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1222](/security/CVE-2015-1222))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1224](/security/CVE-2015-1224))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read

uninitialized memory. ([CVE-2015-1227](/security/CVE-2015-1227))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data

structure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1228](/security/CVE-2015-1228))

It was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject

cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a

malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2015-1229](/security/CVE-2015-1229))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1231](/security/CVE-2015-1231))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-2238](/security/CVE-2015-2238))

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles).

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215, CVE-2015-1216,
CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1219, CVE-2015-1220, CVE-2015-1221,
CVE-2015-1222, CVE-2015-1223, CVE-2015-1224, CVE-2015-1225, CVE-2015-1226,
CVE-2015-1227, CVE-2015-1228, CVE-2015-1229, CVE-2015-1230, CVE-2015-1231)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 41.0.2272.76, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.
