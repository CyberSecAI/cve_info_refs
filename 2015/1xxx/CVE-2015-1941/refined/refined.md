The provided content is related to CVE-2015-1941.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the processing of opcode 1329 in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software improperly handles a specific opcode (1329), leading to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The vulnerability does not require authentication to be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can force the server to read an arbitrary file, disclosing its contents under the context of the SYSTEM user. This allows the attacker to gain access to sensitive information on the vulnerable system.

**Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to TCP port 11460 to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server on TCP port 11460. No authentication is required for exploitation.
