Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from `pigz`'s behavior when decompressing files with the `-N` or `-NT` option, which attempts to restore the original filename from the gzip header. Unlike `gzip`, `pigz` does not sanitize the header name. It directly uses the filename from the header without stripping absolute paths or relative paths containing `..`. This allows malicious archives to specify arbitrary file paths, enabling directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is the lack of sanitization of the filename provided in the gzip header. The program will write to any path specified in the header (absolute or relative), irrespective of the current working directory.
- **Uncontrolled Path:**  The program uses the path of the compressed file combined with the potentially malicious name from the header to construct the path of the output file. This path is used directly with no sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can craft a malicious gzip archive that, when decompressed using `pigz -N`, will write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones in sensitive areas. This includes locations outside of the current working directory, potentially allowing for privilege escalation or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Archive:** The primary attack vector is a crafted gzip archive that contains an absolute path or a relative path with `..` in its header's filename field. When this archive is decompressed with `pigz -N`, the malicious path is used for writing the output file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create Gzip Archives:** The attacker needs to be able to create gzip archives with the ability to manipulate the filename field in the header.
- **Target User Action:** The attacker relies on a target user decompressing the crafted archive using the vulnerable `pigz` version with the `-N` or `-NT` option.
- **No special privilege:** The attacker does not need any special privilege other than the ability to write to the location specified, which will depend on the user running pigz and the path specified.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves stripping any path information from the header name before using it to create the output file.
