- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A user viewing a specially crafted webpage through Internet Explorer. This could involve the attacker hosting a malicious website, or exploiting compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content. The user needs to be convinced to visit the attacker's webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or control a website that serves the malicious content and convince the user to visit this site using Internet Explorer.
