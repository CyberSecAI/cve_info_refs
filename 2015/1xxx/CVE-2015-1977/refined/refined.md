- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Web Administration tool in IBM Tivoli/Security Directory Server is vulnerable to a path traversal issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../) to view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted URL request over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
