Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `charset_to_intern()` function within the `unix/unix.c` file of the Info-ZIP UnZip utility. This function is part of a patch (06-unzip60-alt-iconv-utf8) that handles character set conversions. The issue arises when converting from CP866 to UTF-8, where the destination buffer is not allocated large enough to accommodate the converted string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code allocates a buffer that is too small to hold the converted string, leading to an out-of-bounds write when a string expands during conversion. Specifically, the buffer was allocated with twice the size of the source string plus one byte, which is insufficient for certain character encodings like UTF-8 where a single character might require more than two bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write could overwrite other data on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can craft a malicious zip file that triggers the overflow with specific data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Zip Archive:** An attacker can create a zip archive with filenames that trigger the buffer overflow when `unzip` attempts to convert the character encoding. The vulnerability is triggered during the conversion of a file name from CP866 to UTF-8.
- **User Interaction:** A user or an automated system needs to be tricked into processing the specially crafted zip archive using the vulnerable `unzip` program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious zip archive
-   **Social Engineering or Similar:** The attacker must trick the victim into processing the malicious archive using the vulnerable unzip utility.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Info-ZIP beta/development release version 6.10b and Ubuntu's unzip package.
- The fix involves increasing the buffer size allocated for the converted string.  The patch changes the buffer allocation to four times the size of the source string plus one byte, which is sufficient to handle UTF-8 conversions where a single character can be up to 4 bytes.
- The issue affects the conversion of file names from CP866 to UTF-8
