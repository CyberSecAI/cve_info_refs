| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1199641#c1)  Tomas Hofman    2015-03-18 13:45:12 UTC  ``` This problem is not present in EAP 6.4 (picketbox 4.1.1) anymore.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1199641#c5)  Spolti    2015-03-23 18:34:17 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The bind Credential are being logged:  2015-03-19 19:33:28,569 TRACE [org.jboss.security.auth.spi.AbstractServerLoginModule] (http-localhost/127.0.0.1:8080-1) Logging into LDAP server, env={baseFilter=(userPrincipalName={0}), java.naming.security.credentials=***, jboss.security.security_domain=SPNEGO, java.naming.ldap.attributes.binary=objectSid, password-stacking=useFirstPass, recurseRoles=false, java.naming.security.authentication=simple, baseCtxDN=DC=example,DC=com, roleAttributeIsDN=true, rolesCtxDN=DC=example,DC=com, java.naming.security.principal=bindUser, allowEmptyPassword=true, java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory, java.naming.provider.url=ldap://127.0.0.1:389, roleNameAttributeID=cn, roleAttributeID=memberOf, bindDN=bindUser, bindCredential=password}   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): EAP 6.2.4   How reproducible: Setup the Ldap configurations and enable the TRACE log level.  Steps to Reproduce: Setup the Ldap configurations and enable the TRACE log level and test a simple login page against the login-moule.  Actual results: Bind Credential is logged.  Expected results: The password should be masked.  Additional info: Actually we have:  protected void traceLdapEnv(Properties env)    {       if (trace)       {          Properties tmp = new Properties();          tmp.putAll(env);          String credentials = tmp.getProperty(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS);          if (credentials != null && credentials.length() > 0)             tmp.setProperty(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, "***");          log.trace("Logging into LDAP server, env=" + tmp.toString());       }    }  The traceLdapEnv should looks like:   protected void traceLdapEnv(Properties env)    {       if (trace)       {          Properties tmp = new Properties();          tmp.putAll(env);          String credentials = tmp.getProperty(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS);          String bindCredential = tmp.getProperty(BIND_CREDENTIAL);          if (credentials != null && credentials.length() > 0)             tmp.setProperty(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, "***");             if (bindCredential != null && bindCredential.length() > 0)             tmp.setProperty(BIND_CREDENTIAL, "***");           log.trace("Logging into LDAP server, env=" + tmp.toString());       }    }   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1199641#c8)  baranowb    2015-04-08 13:47:34 UTC  ``` PR is up: <https://github.com/wildfly-security/jboss-negotiation/pull/21>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1199641#c9)  JBoss JIRA Server    2015-04-20 15:27:24 UTC  ``` Darran Lofthouse <darran.lofthouse> updated the status of jira [SECURITY-877](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SECURITY-877) to Resolved   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1199641#c10)  Rostislav Svoboda    2015-04-23 14:25:41 UTC  ``` Please provide test (as discussed with Carlo) to include this in CP01 payload.
