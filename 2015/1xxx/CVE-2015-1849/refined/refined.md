Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `AdvancedLdapLoginModule` in JBoss EAP logging LDAP bind credentials, including the password, at the TRACE log level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive data exposure: The LDAP bind password, which is used to authenticate to the LDAP server, is logged in plain text when TRACE logging is enabled.
- Insufficient logging control: The application logs sensitive information at a verbose log level, which is often enabled for debugging purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: An attacker gaining access to the logs could obtain the LDAP bind password.
- Lateral movement/privilege escalation: The compromised password could potentially be used for further attacks within the network depending on its privileges and scope.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Log file access: An attacker who gains access to the system's log files could discover the LDAP bind credentials. This access could be gained through various means such as compromised accounts, system vulnerabilities, or insider threats.
- Enabled TRACE logging: The attack is dependent on having the TRACE log level enabled in the JBoss EAP configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to JBoss EAP server's logs: An attacker must have the ability to read the server's log files.
- Knowledge of JBoss EAP configuration: The attacker needs to know that TRACE logging is enabled to find the leaked credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed in JBoss EAP 6.4.1
- The fix involves masking the `SECURITY_CREDENTIALS` and `BIND_CREDENTIAL` properties with "***" before logging.
- The fix was implemented in the `AdvancedLdapLoginModule.java` file.
- The pull request and associated commits on GitHub clearly show how the fix was implemented.
- The fix was backported from Wildfly to JBoss EAP.
