- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of opcode 1301 within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server, where a crafted packet sent to TCP port 11460 allows an attacker to use an arbitrary format string as an argument to a `vsprintf` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Format string vulnerability in the `vsprintf` function. Lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. This could result in a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted packet on TCP port 11460.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send packets to TCP port 11460 of the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
