Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2015-1819 lies within how libxml2 handles XML Entity Expansion (XEE). Specifically, the `xmlreader` component in `libxml2` is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when parsing crafted XML data. The issue stems from a failure to enforce constant memory usage during parsing of certain XML documents which allows for an uncontrolled expansion of entities.
*   Specifically, it is related to the `xmlParserHandlePEReference` function in `parser.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is the potential for a DoS attack due to uncontrolled memory consumption. When libxml2 processes a specially crafted XML document, it can allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and potential application crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash**: Applications using the vulnerable libxml2 library may crash due to excessive memory allocation.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming large amounts of CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious XML or HTML document through the network, which is then parsed by an application using the vulnerable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate.
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted XML document to a system that parses it using the vulnerable version of `libxml2`. This can be achieved through a web interface, or processing of a file, or any other pathway that involves XML parsing.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references.
*   The vulnerability is also present in the HTML parser when using `libxml2` in push mode.
*  The fixes often included additional checks and validation of the XML/HTML to prevent parsing errors.
* Red Hat acknowledges this was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
* Apple notes that David Drysdale and Kostya Serebryany from Google found other vulnerabilities that were addressed in the same timeframe
* The vulnerability is addressed by an upstream patch: `<https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=213f1fe0d76d30eaed6e5853057defc43e6df2c9>`.

**Note:** Some of the content also includes details on fixes for other related CVEs which share a common root cause, such as out-of-bounds read or buffer overflow vulnerabilities that were fixed together with CVE-2015-1819.
