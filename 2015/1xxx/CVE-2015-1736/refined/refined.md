Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in Internet Explorer related to how it processes the removal of attributes from HTML elements. Specifically, an attacker can manipulate document elements to force a `CAttrArray` object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Improper memory management when handling HTML element attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage.
- An attacker could host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate one, embedding content that triggers the vulnerability when visited by a user using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- User interaction is required, as the attacker needs to entice the victim to visit the malicious page or open a malicious file. This could be through social engineering tactics such as tricking the user into clicking a malicious link or opening a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host or control a web page or embed content on a page that a victim may visit.
- The attacker needs to create a crafted HTML page that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit their crafted webpage while using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
