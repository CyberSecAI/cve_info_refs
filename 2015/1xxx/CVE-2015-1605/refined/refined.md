  "Advisory 1": {
    "CVE ID": "CVE-2015-1605",
    "Vulnerability Details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Dell ScriptLogic Asset Manager, also known as Quest Workspace Asset Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  To exploit this security flaw, an attacker would make a specially crafted web request to a handler named GetClientPackage.aspx that is installed as part of this product. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of NETWORK SERVICE.",
    "Root cause": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the GetClientPackage.aspx handler.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
       "Unauthenticated access to vulnerable handler"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution under the context of NETWORK SERVICE.",
    "Attack vector": "Specially crafted web request to the GetClientPackage.aspx handler.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Network access to the vulnerable service"
