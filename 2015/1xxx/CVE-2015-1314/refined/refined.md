Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The USAA Mobile app for Android, prior to version 7.10.1, was designed to allow users to stay logged in for up to 20 minutes after a task switch. When this "stay logged in" option was enabled, the app would briefly display the last-viewed screen (which could contain sensitive information like account numbers and balances) before prompting for login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The app displayed sensitive information without requiring authentication after a task switch if the "stay logged in" option was enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to personal and financial information: An attacker could view account numbers and balances by simply launching the application after a task switch when the “stay logged in” option was enabled.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the mobile device is required.
- The attacker must be able to unlock the Android device (or the device must not have a lock screen).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the unlocked device where the USAA mobile app is installed.
- The attacker does not need to know the user's password or PIN to briefly view the information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.10.1 of the USAA Mobile app for Android.
- The vulnerability was not considered a high risk, because it required physical access and only displayed information briefly before requiring login.
