Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow in the `gethostbyname_r` function and other related Name Service Switch (NSS) functions within the GNU C Library (glibc). The issue arises when these functions receive a misaligned buffer, and the buffer length calculation doesn't account for the misalignment, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability manifests as a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Improper Buffer Size Calculation:** The root cause is that `gethostbyname_r` (and related functions) fails to correctly compute the buffer's actual usable size when dealing with misaligned buffers. This can cause the function to write past the end of the buffer, leading to a crash or potentially code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a crafted DNS response that triggers a call to these vulnerable functions with a misaligned buffer.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** There is a risk that the overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected process, although this risk is often mitigated by memory protections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through network interactions, by sending crafted DNS responses to applications that use vulnerable `gethostbyname_r` or related functions.
*   **Remote (in combination with local):** As the misaligned buffer typically originates from the application itself, the attack requires both a network component (for crafting a DNS response) and a local component (for making the application use such buffers).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** Attackers must be able to send crafted DNS responses to a target system.
*   **Application Interaction:** Attackers need to trigger the vulnerable applications to call these functions with misaligned buffers, often by providing an input that would result in this scenario.
*  **Technical Knowledge:** Attacker needs knowledge about glibc's NSS functions and how they are called, including the buffer allocation process.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `nss_dns` code does not properly account for buffer sizes when passed a misaligned buffer during DNS resolution.
*   The issue is triggered by passing a misaligned buffer to certain variants of host name resolution functions (e.g., `gethostbyname_r`).
*   The `send_dg()` and `send_vc()` functions are also mentioned as affected, due to buffer mismanagement when `getaddrinfo()` is called with `AF_UNSPEC`.

**Mitigation:**

*   Patches to glibc correctly adjust for buffer alignment when resolving host names.
*   Applications using `gethostbyname_r`, `getaddrinfo()` or other related NSS functions are vulnerable and should be updated.

**Additional Points (from the documents):**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.6 with a fix for a previous bug (`4381`).
*   The vulnerability affects most applications performing hostname resolution using the functions mentioned.
*   The fix was to enforce a correct buffer size accounting and disable potentially insecure `pt_chown` use.
*  A number of mitigating factors for CVE-2015-7547 have been identified, also present on the reported documents, but not related to CVE-2015-1781.
* While the document related to CVE-2015-8777 explains the vulnerability and its remediation, it's unrelated to the current CVE.

**Note:**

*   Some documents discuss similar vulnerabilities in glibc, such as CVE-2014-8121, CVE-2015-7547, CVE-2015-8776, CVE-2015-8777, CVE-2015-8778, and CVE-2015-8779 but these are distinct issues, although some may be related to the same general area of code.
*   Some documents provide specific details about how SUSE and Debian have addressed the vulnerability, including package versions and advisory information.
*  SUSE rated this as having "moderate" severity while Red Hat rated the same as "Important" based on their scoring method. Both have addressed the issue and advise immediate upgrades.

The information confirms the buffer overflow described in the official CVE, providing details of how the vulnerability occurs and how to address it. The provided content also clarifies that most affected code is within the `nss_dns` module of glibc.
