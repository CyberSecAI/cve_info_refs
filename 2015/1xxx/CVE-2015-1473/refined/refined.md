Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect check within the `ADDW` macro in the GNU C Library's `vfscanf.c` file. Specifically, the check related to `__libc_use_alloca` compares against the number of array entries to allocate, rather than the number of bytes needed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Size Calculation:** The `__libc_use_alloca` check uses the number of array entries instead of the number of bytes. This leads to the function allocating up to four times as many bytes as the intended policy on the stack, specifically in the wide character case.
- **Policy Enforcement Issue:** The intended policy for managing risk when using `alloca` is not enforced correctly, resulting in a weaker policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A remote attacker could cause an application to allocate an excessive amount of stack memory, leading to a denial-of-service by triggering a failed `alloca()`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when handling wide-string input with the `wscanf` function when using `alloca`.
- An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted input that would cause `wscanf` to allocate large amounts of stack memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable `wscanf` function.
-  The attacker's position is not explicitly defined by the available documents, but they must be able to provide the input to the program using the `wscanf` function.

**Additional Notes**
- The `vfscanf.c` source code link provided is helpful for verification and deep-dive investigation
-   The content clarifies that the integer overflow, although present, isn't directly exploitable in the context of this specific vulnerability (CVE-2015-1473), and it would fall under a different CVE if found exploitable.
-   The core of this CVE is a policy enforcement error regarding the usage of alloca, leading to potential denial of service.
