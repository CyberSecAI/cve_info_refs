- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the database automated maintenance feature of IBM DB2. Specifically, a remote, authenticated DB2 user with elevated privileges can manipulate a stored procedure related to automated maintenance policies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the ability of a privileged user to manipulate automated maintenance policy stored procedures, which allows the user to access files they should not have access to. This is a file disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated DB2 user with elevated privileges to view any files owned by the DB2 fenced ID on Unix/Linux systems, or any files owned by the Windows administrator on Windows systems. This could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker must be a remote, authenticated DB2 user with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with elevated privileges within the DB2 environment. They also need to be able to manipulate the automated maintenance policy stored procedure.
