### MSI Solution Applications details

#### iSupplier

iSupplier structures supplier communication through a secure internet-based portal, provides access to real-time information such as purchase orders and invoice payments, and enables supplier response with order acknowledgment and shipment notices.

Highlights

* Allows real-time, integrated view of supplier information: PO, ASNs, shipments, receiving, and invoice and payment status
* Supplier self-registration (by invitation) and self-service to maintain your own data (eg banking, contacts)
* Direct Material suppliers will also view demand forecast in Collaborative Planning within iSupplier
* Direct Material suppliers will enter and maintain lead times, MOQ, etc for production parts
* Services suppliers must enter work confirmations when they have completed services to trigger the receipt
* Corrective actions for quality issues will be entered in iSupplier

**Collaborative Planning**

Collaborative Planning (CP) is a web-based application that provides advanced capabilities for communicating, planning, and optimizing supply and demand information.

**Highlights**

* Oracle Collaborative Planning replaced Trading Partner Collaboration (TPC) for demand sharing and supplier commitments.
* Planning horizon is 14 months vs. previous TPC horizon of 12 months. This Horizon is currently displayed as 26 weeks plus 8 months.
* In Collaborative Planning, suppliers will receive net demand in the form of planned orders. These planned orders are supply required by the Oracle planning module, for that date and quantity, and already considers minimums and safety stock.
* Forecasts (Planned Orders) are shared in the Collaborative Planning application. These forecasts are in addition to the open Purchase Orders received prior to the CP publication. At the time of CP publication, the expectation of the supplier is represented by the open PO Need By Dates and the CP Planned orders.
* Suppliers are expected to plan, purchase, and build per these Planned Orders. MSI will issue Purchase Orders and/or Blanket Releases for Supplier to ship and invoice against.  MSI's liability is limited to the lead-time of Planned Order items.
* Suppliers are required to provide commitments throughout the horizon - against open POs and/or Blanket Releases in iSupplier and against planned orders in CP. Supplier performance metrics have been created to track attainment.
* To improve/insure Supplier’s efficiency within Collaborative Planning, we are recommending
  + Review the Training materials that can be found on this Portal
  + Use the Mass update capability available for Collaborative Planning.
  + Suppliers should update their Commitments weekly in CP by Tuesday COB.

**MCM - Motorola Collaboration Management**

Motorola Collaboration Management (MCM) is a web-based tool that provides enhanced capabilities for communicating, planning and optimizing supply and demand information.

Highlights

MCM is replacing the following for Motorola Solutions’ direct purchasing business:

* Oracle Collaborative Planning for demand sharing.
* iSupplier for PO communication and supplier commitments and advanced shipping notifications.

All suppliers for direct purchases are expected to use the MCM tool to plan, purchase, build and provide commitments per forecasted demand volumes.

#### Agile

Agile PLM is MSI’s Product Lifecycle Management manufactured by Oracle. Agile manages the many changes a hardware or software product undergoes, from design and development through ultimate retirement or disposal.

Highlights

* Streamlines collaboration between partners and MSI
* Partners can manage the status of Engineering changes using a newly designed Supplier Dashboard
* Partners can easily upload environmental data using a web tool hosted in Agile PLM
* Full Integration of the Product Change Notification process into Agile replacing TPC-PCN
* MSI design and manufacturing partners can submit engineering change requests directly in Agile PLM, greatly increasing collaboration and reducing email requests

**Sourcing**

Oracle Sourcing facilitates collaboration and negotiation on existing goods and services as well as new opportunities (RFQ, RFP and Auction)

Highlights

* Can be used for any type of sourcing event: direct, indirect, goods and services
* In use today in our current Oracle environment
* Facilitates qualifying and maintaining suppliers and conducting negotiations
* Will have the ability to invite RFQ-only suppliers
* Better integrated process from RFx to PO means fewer opportunities for error

**Transcepta**

Transcepta is a cloud-based, third-party service to support Purchase Orders and AP invoices.

Highlights

* Transcepta will replace OB10/Tungsten for eInvoicing
* Free to suppliers (by invitation)
* Will handle electronic transmission of invoices for high-volume suppliers
* Transcepta will coordinate on-boarding with suppliers, including training
