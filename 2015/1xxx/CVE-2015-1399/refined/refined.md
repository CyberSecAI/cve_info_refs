{
  "CVE-2015-1399": {
    "Description": "This CVE is part of a chain of vulnerabilities in the Magento e-commerce platform that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability chain arises from multiple flaws in Magento's request handling, privilege checks, and template parsing mechanisms.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Controller Injection: Bypassing admin authentication by injecting admin-context modules into a user-context.",
      "Control Flow Logic Flaw: Bypassing authentication checks using the 'forwarded' parameter, which allows access to any admin module.",
      "Template Parsing Vulnerability: Exploiting the cms_wysiwyg controller's filter() function to create a Magento-block class under attacker control, leading to LFI.",
       "SQL Injection: Exploiting the widget_grid class's CSV file export functionality to inject SQL queries via the filter parameter, enabling arbitrary SQL execution.",
        "Remote File Inclusion via Phar Wrapper: Utilizing the 'phar://' wrapper to bypass path checks and execute arbitrary code within a crafted PHP archive embedded in an image file."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation results in complete compromise of the Magento-based store, including full access to the database, credit card information, and other personal data, as well as arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with crafted URLs to exploit controller injection.",
      "HTTP requests including the 'forwarded' parameter to bypass authentication checks.",
      "HTTP requests including the '___directive' parameter with a crafted payload to inject blocks and trigger LFI/RFI.",
     "HTTP requests with a crafted 'filter' parameter to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.",
      "File upload vulnerability to store a crafted image file containing malicious php code."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Magento application. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable components and the steps necessary to chain these vulnerabilities."
