Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `pcsd` daemon, which provides a command-line tool and web UI for configuring and managing Pacemaker and Corosync, did not properly sign cookies containing session data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Session Management:** The core issue was the lack of cryptographic signing of session cookies. This allowed for manipulation of cookie content by a malicious user.
- **Missing HTTPOnly Flag:**  A secondary issue, split into CVE-2015-3983, is the lack of the HTTPOnly flag on session cookies. This makes the cookies accessible to client-side scripts and thereby increases the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Authorization:** A remote attacker could forge session cookies by crafting their own, effectively bypassing authentication checks in the `pcsd` web UI.
- **Elevated Privileges:** By bypassing authorization, the attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges within the `pcsd` web UI, leading to unauthorized configuration or management of Pacemaker and Corosync.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an attacker with network access to the `pcsd` web UI.
- **Web UI:** The attack is focused on the web interface of the `pcsd` daemon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the `pcsd` web UI via network.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP and Cookies:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of how HTTP cookies function to craft malicious ones.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding `:secure => true` and `:httponly => true` flags when creating the session cookie using Rack::Session::Cookie. `:secure => true` ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS, while `:httponly => true` prevents Javascript access.

- The vulnerability was discovered by Tomas Jelinek of Red Hat.

- Red Hat assigned a separate CVE (CVE-2015-3983) for the lack of the HTTPOnly flag in Set-Cookie header, which is an additional vulnerability that was discovered as part of the analysis of the same code.

- The provided patch also fixes a bug where `pcsd` failed to start if IPv6 was disabled.
