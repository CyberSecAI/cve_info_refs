Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1067:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Secure Transport accepting short ephemeral RSA keys, typically used in export-strength RSA cipher suites, even when the connection is using full-strength RSA cipher suites. This is known as the "FREAK" attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Acceptance of weak, export-grade RSA keys when stronger ciphers were expected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with a privileged network position could intercept SSL/TLS connections.
- By forcing the use of weakened encryption, the attacker could potentially break the encryption and steal or manipulate sensitive data exchanged over the connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the vulnerable client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged network position, meaning they can intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the server.
- The attack specifically targets connections to servers which support export-strength RSA cipher suites.

**Affected Products:**
- iOS 8.2 (iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later)
- Watch OS 1.0.1 (Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, and Apple Watch Edition)
- Apple TV 7.1 (Apple TV 3rd generation and later)
- OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, and OS X Yosemite v10.10.2.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes a comprehensive list of websites that were vulnerable to the FREAK attack at the time of discovery.
- The issue was addressed by removing support for ephemeral RSA keys.
- The issue is also described as an OpenSSL vulnerability in CVE-2015-0204.
