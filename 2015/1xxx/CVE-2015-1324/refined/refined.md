Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1324:

**Root Cause:**

- The Apport package, when configured to create core dumps for setuid binaries (fs.suid\_dumpable=2), would create root-owned core dump files in the current working directory (CWD) of the crashed process.
- This behavior allowed regular users to create root-owned core dump files in arbitrary directories, including write-protected ones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Core Dump Creation:** Apport was creating core dump files for setuid binaries as root in the CWD, violating the intended behavior of `fs.suid_dumpable=2`, where core dumps should not be written for these programs.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** Users could trigger the creation of root-owned core dump files in locations they normally wouldn't have write access to by crashing a privileged process.
- **Code Injection via Core Dumps:** Crafted core dumps, placed in locations such as `/etc/logrotate.d`, could be parsed and executed by other services, leading to arbitrary code execution as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user could gain root privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a specially crafted core dump file in a location where another process would execute it (e.g., `/etc/logrotate.d`), a malicious user could execute arbitrary code as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Triggering a Crash:** The attacker needs to trigger a crash of a setuid or otherwise protected binary for which they don't have read permissions and `fs.suid_dumpable` is set to 2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A regular (non-root) user account on the vulnerable system.
- The ability to execute programs and trigger crashes.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ubuntu releases from 12.04 up to 15.04 (with Upstart) and possibly other distributions using vulnerable versions of Apport.
*   The vulnerability exists due to the combination of Apport creating core dumps in CWD and the system being configured with `fs.suid_dumpable=2` by default, beginning with Ubuntu 12.04.
*   The fix involves preventing Apport from creating core dumps for suid binaries when `fs.suid_dumpable=2`, or dumping to a safe, dedicated directory.
*   The vulnerability is not present in Ubuntu 15.04 with systemd due to an erroneous omission in the systemd unit configuration, but it is still present with the Upstart init system on the same version.
