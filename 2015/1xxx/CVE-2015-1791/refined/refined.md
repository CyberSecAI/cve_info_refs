Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-1791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause is a race condition in the `ssl3_get_new_session_ticket` function within OpenSSL, which occurs when a multi-threaded client attempts to reuse a previous session ticket while simultaneously receiving a new one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**

*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition occurs due to the improper handling of the  `NewSessionTicket` in multi-threaded client. This improper handling can lead to multiple threads attempting to access and modify the session ticket data at the same time.
*   **Double Free:** The race condition can result in a double free of the session ticket data, a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a crash of the application using the vulnerable OpenSSL code due to the double free.
*   **Possible Unspecified Impacts:** The CVE description acknowledges the *possibility* of other unspecified impacts, suggesting potential for further exploitation if an attacker can manipulate the corrupted memory.

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker who controls the server to which a vulnerable client is connecting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker with a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) position would be best situated for exploitation.
*   **Control over the server:** The attacker needs to control the server to which the vulnerable client connects, so that they can inject malicious `NewSessionTicket` messages.
*   **Multi-threaded Client:** The client application needs to use OpenSSL in a multi-threaded context for the race condition to be triggered.

**Additional Technical Details (from content)**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenSSL versions before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered when the client attempts to reuse an existing session and the server sends a new `NewSessionTicket` at the same time.
*   The issue was discovered by Emilia KÃ¤sper and the fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team
*   The fix includes ensuring that sessions in the client's session cache do not have their session ID changed when a new session ticket is processed for an already cached session.
*   A timing side channel in RSA decryption was fixed as part of resolving this issue (bnc#929678)
*   EXPORT ciphers are disabled by default as a related security improvement.

**Affected Products (from content)**

Several products are listed as being affected by this CVE including, but not limited to:

*   SUSE Linux Enterprise products
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux products
*   OpenSUSE
*   Various Cisco Products (e.g., Webex, Jabber, Cisco ASA)
*   Arista EOS
*   NetBSD
*   HPE Proliant servers
*   Ubuntu
*   Various IBM products

**Mitigations and Resolutions (from content)**

*   **Upgrading OpenSSL:** The primary solution is to upgrade OpenSSL to the versions specified in the advisory, which contain patches for this vulnerability. The specific versions are:

    *   OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
    *   OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
    *   OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
    *   OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg
*   **Disabling EXPORT ciphers:** Disabling EXPORT ciphers can mitigate some related attacks.
*   **Reboot/Restart Affected Services:** The content notes that a reboot or restart of services using the updated OpenSSL libraries are needed to ensure the changes are effective.
