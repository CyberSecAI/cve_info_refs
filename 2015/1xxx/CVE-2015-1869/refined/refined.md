Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) handled symbolic links in its default event handling scripts. These scripts, designed to run post-crash actions on problem directories, would follow symbolic links, leading to potential privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symbolic Link Following:** The core vulnerability is that ABRT's default event handling scripts would follow symbolic links when processing files within the problem directories.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The event scripts did not properly validate or sanitize inputs, allowing an attacker to manipulate the symbolic links and file paths to point to arbitrary locations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Due to the scripts being executed with root privileges, an attacker could leverage this flaw to escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with write access to an ABRT problem directory could create a symbolic link (e.g., `var_log_messages` pointing to a file like `/etc/cron.hourly/`) and by triggering ABRT's event handling scripts, cause the scripts to operate on the attacker's controlled target. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system.
*   **Arbitrary File Operations:** The vulnerability enables the attacker to perform arbitrary file operations as the root user within the context of the event handling scripts.
*   **Information Disclosure:** While not the primary issue for this CVE, this vulnerability could also be combined with CVE-2015-1870 for information disclosure, if the attacker manipulated the symlinks to cause ABRT to include other system data in the user accessible directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have write access to an ABRT problem directory (e.g., subdirectories of `/var/tmp/abrt` or `/var/spool/abrt`).
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker must create a symbolic link within the problem directory, pointing to a location where they wish to execute code or read/write sensitive data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Write Access to Problem Directory:**  The attacker needs write permissions to at least one ABRT problem directory. This can be achieved via a variety of means like exploiting another application to write data into such directory.
*  **Trigger Crash:** The attacker also needs to trigger a crash that will use the manipulated problem directory and invoke the vulnerable event handling scripts.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is a reoccurrence of a similar issue in `abrt-hook-ccpp`, but this time at a higher level, specifically in the event handling scripts.
*   The fix involves preventing non-root users from triggering the default event scripts run by `abrtd` under the root user.
*   The fix also addresses an issue where non-root users could trigger `CCpp`, `Koops`, `vmcore`, and `xorg` analyzers via the `abrt-dbus` interface.

The provided information includes the fixes implemented to mitigate this vulnerability. These fixes include:

*   Restricting the execution of `post-create` event scripts to the root user only.
*   Restricting the creation of certain problem types such as `CCpp`, `Koops`, `vmcore`, and `xorg` to the root user only.
*   The commits `3287aa12eb205cff95cdd00d6d6c5c9a4f8f0eca` and `7417505e1d93cc95ec648b74e3c801bc67aacb9f` on the abrt github repository specifically address this issue.
