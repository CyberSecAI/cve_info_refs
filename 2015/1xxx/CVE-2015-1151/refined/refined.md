- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access controls for the Activity and People wiki pages were not enforced on iPad clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Access controls may not be enforced on mobile devices, potentially allowing unauthorized access to wiki pages.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing the Activity and People wiki pages using an iPad client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to access the wiki pages using an iPad client, but would not need any particular permissions to bypass the access controls.
