  "cveId": "CVE-2015-1815",
  "description": "The setroubleshoot packages provide tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When Access Vector Cache (AVC) messages are returned, an alert can be generated that provides information about the problem and helps to track its resolution. It was found that setroubleshoot did not sanitize file names supplied in a shell command look-up for RPMs associated with access violation reports. An attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system by supplying a specially crafted file to the underlying shell command.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `setroubleshootd` daemon, which runs as root, directly passes a pathname from an SELinux access violation message to a shell command (`rpm -qf`) without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection: Passing unsanitized, attacker-controlled input to a shell command.",
      "Privilege Escalation: Exploiting a root process vulnerability to gain higher privileges.",
      "Insufficient Input Validation: Lack of proper checks on the file path passed to the shell.",
      "Use of `commands.getstatusoutput`: Utilizing this deprecated function that executes a shell command."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local: The primary attack vector involves local users triggering an SELinux access violation with a specially crafted file path.",
      "Potentially Remote: There is mention that remote vectors are possible if attackers can control part of the filenames being created by web uploads, git, scp, or ftp etc."
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to trigger SELinux access violations. This can be achieved by controlling a file path that the setroubleshoot service accesses.",
      "On systems with default polkit settings, access to NetworkManager VPN connection modifications is needed to exploit the provided PoC, however, the same vulnerability is present in a number of other cases where filenames are passed to setroubleshootd."
