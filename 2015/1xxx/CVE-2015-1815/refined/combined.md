# Fedora 21 setroubleshootd 3.2.22 - Local Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 36564

#### CVE:

###### [2015-1815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1815)

###### [Sebastian Krahmer](/?author=4182)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
setroubleshoot tries to find out which rpm a particular
file belongs to when it finds SELinux access violation reports.
The idea is probably to have convenient reports for the admin
which type enforcement rules have to be relaxed. setroubleshoot
runs as root (although in its own domain). In util.py
we have:

266 def get_rpm_nvr_by_file_path_temporary(name):
267     if name is None or not os.path.exists(name):
268         return None
269
270     nvr = None
271     try:
272         import commands
273         rc, output = commands.getstatusoutput("rpm -qf '%s'" % name)
274         if rc == 0:
275             nvr = output
276     except:
277         syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "failed to retrieve rpm info for %s" %     name)
278     return nvr

(and other similar occurences)

So. Yes, thats correct: The SELinux system that is only there to protect you,
passes attacker controlled data to sh -c (https://docs.python.org/2/library/commands.html)
inside a daemon running as root. Sacken lassen...

I attached a PoC which uses networkmanager's openvpn plugin to execute
arbitraty commands by triggering an access violation to a pathname
which contains shell commands.

The setroubleshootd_t domain has quite a lot of allowed rules and transitions,
so this can clearly count as privilege escalation. Furthermore a lot
of admins run their system in permissive mode (full root) even when
its shipped enforcing by default.

Also note that there are potentially remote vectors, if attackers
can control part of the filenames being created (web uploads, git, scp, ftp etc).

Sebastian

PS: I am all for SELinux but theres something on the wrong way. I counted
the LOC, and the core SELinux (kernel) has a smaller codebase than whats
framed around in python, running as root and mangling attacker controlled input.
IOW, the system that wants to protect you has fewer code enforcing the rules
than code that potentially blows up your system. And that code is python,
so let alone all the python modules and interpreter hat can have bugs on its own.
Driving such a lane _can only lead to abyss_. And I am not saying that evil
powers are creating an overly complex system to better hide their bugdoors
within.

PPS: bug-logo will follow :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: setroubleshoot security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0729)

## Topic

Updated setroubleshoot packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The setroubleshoot packages provide tools to help diagnose SELinux
problems. When Access Vector Cache (AVC) messages are returned, an alert
can be generated that provides information about the problem and helps to
track its resolution.

It was found that setroubleshoot did not sanitize file names supplied in a
shell command look-up for RPMs associated with access violation reports.
An attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system
by supplying a specially crafted file to the underlying shell command.
(CVE-2015-1815)

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
reporting this issue.

All setroubleshoot users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-18 16:32:09 UTC  ``` It was found that setroubleshoot did not sanitize file names supplied in a shell command look-up for RPMs associated with access violation reports. An attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system by supplying a specially crafted file to the underlying shell command.  The vulnerable code in util.py:  266 def get_rpm_nvr_by_file_path_temporary(name): 267     if name is None or not os.path.exists(name): 268         return None 269  270     nvr = None 271     try: 272         import commands 273         rc, output = commands.getstatusoutput("rpm -qf '%s'" % name) 274         if rc == 0: 275             nvr = output 276     except: 277         syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "failed to retrieve rpm info for %s" %     name) 278     return nvr  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c4)  Petr Lautrbach    2015-03-19 10:59:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1003803](attachment.cgi?id=1003803&action=diff "don't use unsecure commands.getstatusoutput in for getting rpm nvr") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1003803&action=edit "don't use unsecure commands.getstatusoutput in for getting rpm nvr") don't use unsecure commands.getstatusoutput in for getting rpm nvr  subprocess module methods doesn't use shell by default.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c12)  Petr Lautrbach    2015-03-20 10:46:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c10)) > This looks insufficient.  What if a filename is e.g. "-a"? >  > BTW, at least my copy of RPM doesn't appear to support "--" to stop > sub-option parsing. >  > In general, this design feels very fragile.  I'd disable the feature.  Thinking more about this I'd use the proposed patch:  - You should not be able to run arbitrary code using only an argument of rpm command.  - When you have "-a" file, rpm command will get "/tmp/-a" as an argument, not "-a" directly   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c13)  Petr Lautrbach    2015-03-20 15:56:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1004551](attachment.cgi?id=1004551&action=diff "fix get_rpm_nvr_*_temporary functions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1004551&action=edit "fix get_rpm_nvr_*_temporary functions") fix get_rpm_nvr_*_temporary functions  - use subprocess.check_output() instead of commands.getstatusoutput() - use os.path.abspath() to get a normalized absolutized version of the name.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c16)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-03-26 08:06:04 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/26/1>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1203352#c17)  Huzaifa S.

#### The revenge of *GingerBreak*

**Abstract:** This paper demonstrates vulnerabilities within the
SELinux framework as well as shortcomings in the type enforcement setup.
I will show how to deconstruct a SELinux setup with some simple 80's style
exploit techniques. While reading this paper, I recommend listening
to [this music from the year of morrisworm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufERJEdcfAY)

##### Introduction

When in 2012 the SELinux developers analyzed the behaivior of an exploit
that was not designed to run on a SELinux system [at page 32 of these slides](http://selinuxproject.org/~seandroid/slides/LinuxConNA2012-SEAndroid.pdf) - it
triggered a review-selector for SELinux and I put it to the list of my audit
targets. Not surprisingly, *GingerBreak* lost that "competition", just because
it was not made for it. Using my QUANTUM AUDIT techniques I was now able to have
a deeper look into SELinux itself to see whether the claims that were made
really hold.

##### The AVC subsystem

SELinux is basically split into two parts. The kernel part, which mostly
consists of the Access Vector Cache (AVC) logic, and a userspace part which
I will call the SELinux framework. The framework consists of a lot of Python
scripts running as root and/or as a DBUS service. The AVC itself basically
decides whether a permission is granted or not, based on the typing and
transitioning rules from the policy.

When the AVC denies access, it used to send a netlink message from the kernel
to the audit subsystem which looks like this:

```
type=AVC msg=audit(1427104951.889:423): avc:  denied  { open } for  pid=2521
comm="openvpn" path=2F74[...]27 dev="tmpfs" ino=31315
scontext=system_u:system_r:openvpn_t:s0
tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0

```

within a single line. It basically tells the admin that *openvpn*, running
in the *openvpn\_t* domain, was denied access to a file object with type
*user\_tmp\_t*. The pathname of the object in question is encoded as hex string
for a reason. This logging makes sense in order to maintain the system.

The audit subsystem can be be further configured with plugins to handle such
messages. For example on a Fedora 21 system there is a plugin that further
mangles such messages via *sedispatch* to the *setroubleshoot* DBUS service.
Since everything in a targeted policy is safe due to type enforcement MAC
(which we will break later), all this runs as root of course.

##### Where is my mind?

Now lets have a look on how this *setroubleshoot* DBUS service, running as
root (although in its SELinux domain sandbox), handles this untrusted pathname
input originating from the AVC deny message:

```
def get_rpm_nvr_by_file_path_temporary(name):
    if name is None or not os.path.exists(name):
        return None

    nvr = None
    try:
        import commands
        rc, output = commands.getstatusoutput("rpm -qf '%s'" % name)
        if rc == 0:
            nvr = output
    except:
        syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "failed to retrieve rpm info for %s" % name)
    return nvr
```

The *setroubleshootd* daemon which runs as root, activated by its DBUS
activation file when *sedispatch* was forwarding its AVC denial message,
straight passes the pathname to a shell without further sanitization. This
directly pops us in a rootshell running in the *setroubleshootd\_t* domain.
Bad luck for us, this domain is not allowed to dump the shadow file. The
framework which is meant to protect you by means of a MAC system, just
donated a **uid 0** shell to the attacker.

The next chapter will show how this particular MAC setup can't even hold
what it promised to be their stronghold: Once (in the unlikely case) an
attacker successfully exploited a process, he is caged in its unprivileged
domain.

##### Containers dont contain.

And so don't domains. I really love that deep sentence that was philosophically
spoken in response to my docker exploit which demonstrated a breakout of the
docker container. Programmers are the better philosophers.

By looking at the policy rules with regard to the *setroubleshootd\_t* domain,
we quickly find that it is allowed to *create* and *setattr* file objects within
its own directory. This comes with little surprise, but it allows us to mount
the well known **Vichy-attack** against sandboxed systems where two domains
collaborate. That is, the command is constructed as follows:

```
cd var;cd lib;cd setroubleshoot;cat $SHELL > sh;chmod 04755 sh

```

Its necessary to avoid the `/` character because we are passing
along a filename and it makes things easier since we dont need
to create sub directories. This command, when executed from within
the *setroubleshootd\_t* domain, will leave a suid shell in place
for the discretionary execution by the attacker who already runs
his shell in the *unconfined\_t* domain.

[![Voila!](https://github.com/stealth/troubleshooter/raw/master/troubleshooter.jpg)](https://github.com/stealth/troubleshooter/blob/master/troubleshooter.jpg)

A demo exploit using *NetworkManager's* openvpn plugin as an attack vector is
included in this git. Dont get fooled: There exist many other
attack vectors (not just *NetworkManager's* integrated wifi setup in case
the openvpn plugin is not available), some of
them might work remotely. All an attacker needs to do is to trick a confined
domain to access one of his files. If **polkit** has rules to just allow
active or console sessions to access the attack vector, that is not an
obstacle either: just put it to the target user's *.bashrc* to execute
it on the attacker's behalf.

##### Conclusion

I just demonstrated an exploit against SELinux itself (not an exploit
against some buggy 3rd party suid binary which it claims to mitigate)
with simplest exploit math. I further outlined that the claims of confinement
were wrong.
No kernel exploits such as [these](http://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/) were required. Kernel security is a different topic, best discussed with spender.

##### Epilogue

You might be surprised to hear that despite this writeup I am
still convinced that MAC systems (and the SELinux type enforcement
in particular) are still very valuable. At least the SELinux core (the
kernel part and some of the libraries) are of good code quality and
type enforcement has been well researched. If you play a little bit
around with it you immediately see its value and get to know that
it has its beauty. However, type enforcement does not allow to switch
off the brain and to frame around a lot of crap that eventually just throws
away what the MAC system initially bought you.
In fact, SELinux has silently become the largest installation base of a MAC
system by the SEAndroid rollout since **KitKat**, without major problems.

Let me stress that I dont point at people making bugs/mistakes. I certainly
have enough stupid bugs in my own code. However, projects making claims
and presentations based on wrong assumptions deserve a deeper look. In
particular if made by organizations that play the interdiction game on
the backflip of the coin.
I just felt it was necessary to demonstrate how it would look like when I
target a MAC system and that mitigation of exploits *not* targeting type
enforcement has to be put in context since today.

As per list policy, here is the forward of the distros post. CRD was shifted
to today.

subject: ***UNCHECKED*** [vs] setroubleshoot root exploit (CVE-Request)
X-Mailer: MIME-tools 5.501 (Entity 5.501)

Hi

I already sent this to upstream. Initially I thought this only
affects redhat, but it seems that ubuntu is also using setroubleshoot.
CRD is 24.3.

setroubleshoot tries to find out which rpm a particular
file belongs to when it finds SELinux access violation reports.
The idea is probably to have convenient reports for the admin
which type enforcement rules have to be relaxed. setroubleshoot
runs as root (although in its own domain). In util.py
we have:

266 def get_rpm_nvr_by_file_path_temporary(name):
267     if name is None or not os.path.exists(name):
268         return None
269
270     nvr = None
271     try:
272         import commands
273         rc, output = commands.getstatusoutput("rpm -qf '%s'" % name)
274         if rc == 0:
275             nvr = output
276     except:
277         syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "failed to retrieve rpm info for %s" %     name)
278     return nvr

(and other similar occurences)

So. Yes, thats correct: The SELinux system that is only there to protect you,
passes attacker controlled data to sh -c (<https://docs.python.org/2/library/commands.html>)
inside a daemon running as root. Sacken lassen...

I attached a PoC which uses networkmanager's openvpn plugin to execute
arbitraty commands by triggering an access violation to a pathname
which contains shell commands.

The setroubleshootd_t domain has quite a lot of allowed rules and transitions,
so this can clearly count as privilege escalation. Furthermore a lot
of admins run their system in permissive mode (full root) even when
its shipped enforcing by default.

Also note that there are potentially remote vectors, if attackers
can control part of the filenames being created (web uploads, git, scp, ftp etc).

Sebastian

PS: I am all for SELinux but theres something on the wrong way. I counted
the LOC, and the core SELinux (kernel) has a smaller codebase than whats
framed around in python, running as root and mangling attacker controlled input.
IOW, the system that wants to protect you has fewer code enforcing the rules
than code that potentially blows up your system. And that code is python,
so let alone all the python modules and interpreter hat can have bugs on its own.
Driving such a lane _can only lead to abyss_. And I am not saying that evil
powers are creating an overly complex system to better hide their bugdoors
within.

PPS: bug-logo will follow :)
