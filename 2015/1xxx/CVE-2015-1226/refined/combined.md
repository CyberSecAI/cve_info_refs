## Issue [910053002](/910053002/): Validate debuggee.targetId before use in chrome.debugger (Closed)

Yeah, that'd probably work.  Nevermind.

The rule for nullptr is pretty much just "prefer nullptr".  So it's worth using in new code, or when refactoring old code, but probably not worth contaminating the git blame history for the whole file (which is why we haven't just done a repo-wide find-and-replace).

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215, CVE-2015-1216,
CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1219, CVE-2015-1220, CVE-2015-1221,
CVE-2015-1222, CVE-2015-1223, CVE-2015-1224, CVE-2015-1225, CVE-2015-1226,
CVE-2015-1227, CVE-2015-1228, CVE-2015-1229, CVE-2015-1230, CVE-2015-1231)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 41.0.2272.76, which corrects these issues. After
