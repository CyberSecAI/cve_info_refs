## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3057181)

Published: May 12, 2015 | Updated: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 4.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important\*\*\*\*for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Office 2007
* Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, Microsoft Word 2010
* Microsoft Office 2013, Microsoft Excel 2013, Microsoft PowerPoint 2013, Microsoft Word 2013
* Microsoft Office 2013 RT, Microsoft Excel 2013 RT, Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 RT, Microsoft Word 2013 RT
* Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011, Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac 2011, Microsoft Word for Mac 2011
* Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer
* Word Automation Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010
* Word Automation Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013
* Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010, Microsoft Excel Web App 2010
* Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013
* Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010
* Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files, by correcting how Office handles files in memory, and by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Update FAQ

**Why are some of the update files listed in this bulletin also denoted in other bulletins being released in May?**

Several of the update files listed in this bulletin are also denoted in other bulletins being released in May due to overlaps in affected software. Although the different bulletins address separate security vulnerabilities, the security updates have been consolidated where possible and appropriate. Therefore some identical update files are present in multiple bulletins.

Note that identical update files being released with multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

**Does this update contain any additional security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed for the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin, this update includes defense-in-depth updates to help make Microsoft Office more secure.

**I have Microsoft Word 2010 installed. Why am I not being offered the 3054841update?**

The 3054841update only applies to systems running specific configurations of Microsoft Office 2010. Some configurations will not be offered the update.

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2013 products, only Microsoft Office 2013 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Excel 2013, Microsoft Visio 2013, or any other Microsoft Office 2013 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:
