- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory when parsing specially crafted files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities in how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a user to open a specially crafted file. This can be achieved through:
    - Email attacks: Sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing them to open it.
    - Web-based attacks: Hosting a website (or leveraging a compromised website) that contains a specially crafted file, and convincing the user to visit the site and open the file via a link in an email or instant message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the specially crafted file to a user of a vulnerable Microsoft Office product. They also need to convince the user to open the file.
