Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `BN_GF2m_mod_inv` function within the `crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c` file of OpenSSL. This function does not properly handle ECParameters structures where the curve is defined over a malformed binary polynomial field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The function fails to validate the structure of the binary polynomial field used in elliptic curve parameters.
*  **Infinite Loop:** When presented with a malformed structure, the function enters an infinite loop instead of properly handling the error condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the infinite loop in `BN_GF2m_mod_inv`. This renders the affected application unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a session that uses an elliptic curve algorithm.
*   **Malicious Data:** The attacker needs to send a malformed ECParameters structure within the session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be located remotely.
*  **Session Initiation:** The attacker needs to initiate a session with a server that supports elliptic curve algorithms and client authentication.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to create a crafted malformed ECParameters structure.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found to exist in multiple versions of OpenSSL: before 0.9.8s, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0e, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b
*   The vulnerability specifically relates to the processing of ECParameters, particularly when client authentication is enabled on the server side
*  The vulnerability was demonstrated through an attack against a server supporting client authentication, which suggests that the crafted ECParameters were most likely contained within a certificate presented by the client.
*   The fix involves modifying the `BN_GF2m_mod_inv` to correctly handle a NULL BIO data structure (as described in one of the bugzilla entries).
