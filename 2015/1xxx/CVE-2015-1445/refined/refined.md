Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The script `admin/status_network.cgi` insufficiently sanitizes its output, leading to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response sent by the `admin/status_network.cgi` script.
*  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The same lack of output sanitization also allows for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Header Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers into the server's response, potentially leading to various attacks such as:
    *   **Session hijacking:** By injecting `Set-Cookie` headers, attackers might be able to steal session cookies.
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** By injecting `Content-Type` headers or other headers that influence the interpretation of the response by the browser, it can contribute to further attacks such as XSS.
    *   **Cache poisoning:** Injecting headers to influence caching.
*  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   **Cookie theft:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Account compromise:** Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Redirecting** the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `admin/status_network.cgi` script. An attacker needs to send a crafted request that is not properly sanitized by the `admin/status_network.cgi` script to inject the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "status:view" rights on the web administration interface.
*   **Access to the Web Interface:** The attacker must have network access to the fli4l web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the fli4l web administration frontend within the `httpd` package.
*   The vulnerability exists in fli4l versions 3.x and 4.0 up to 2015-01-23.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in fli4l version 3.10.1 and tarballs of the 4.0 development branch from 2015-01-30 and later.
*   A workaround includes disabling the web administration interface or restricting access to trusted users.
