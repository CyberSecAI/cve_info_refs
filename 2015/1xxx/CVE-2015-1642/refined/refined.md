**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office software's improper handling of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability exists due to the failure of Microsoft Office to properly manage objects in memory.
- This can lead to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- This could lead to the attacker performing actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions.
- Depending on the user's privileges, an attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, accessing/modifying/deleting data, or creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Email Attack:** An attacker sends a specially crafted file to a user, tricking them into opening it.
-   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious file on a website or leverages a compromised website to host the malicious file. The attacker then attempts to convince the user to visit the website and open the file.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
-   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious file to the victim either via email or web-based means and convince the user to open the file.
- The user needs to have a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software installed.
