## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3080790)

Published: August 11, 2015 | Updated: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 3.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Correcting how Office handles files in memory
* Improving, in conjunction with the updates for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Windows, how Microsoft Office programs are executed from Internet Explorer
* Correcting how Office validates Office templates prior to use
* Correcting how Office handles integer bounds checking

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3080790](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3080790).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

The following severity ratings assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin's release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [August bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-aug).

## Update FAQ

**CVE-2015-2423 discussed in this bulletin is also discussed in other bulletins being released in August. Do I need to install multiple updates to be protected from this vulnerability?**

Yes. To be protected from CVE-2015-2423, customers must apply all of the updates provided in this bulletin for their affected software, as well as the update for Internet Explorer provided in [MS15-079](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619622). Likewise, customers running an affected version of Microsoft Windows must also install the applicable updates provided in [MS15-088](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619622). Customers who do not install all of the updates available for their affected software will not be fully protected from the vulnerability.

**MS15-080, MS15-081, and MS15-084 all address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. Are the security updates in the three bulletins related?**

No. The security updates in MS15-080, MS15-081, and MS15-084 are not related. Customers should install the updates in both bulletins for the software installed on their systems.

**Does this update contain any additional security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed for the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin, this update includes defense-in-depth updates to help make Microsoft Office more secure.

**I have Microsoft Word 2010 installed. Why am I not being offered the 3055037 update?**

The 3055037 update only applies to systems running specific configurations of Microsoft Office 2010. Some configurations will not be offered the update.

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2013 products, only Microsoft Office 2013 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Excel 2013, Microsoft Visio 2013, or any other Microsoft Office 2013 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then, for example, take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2466

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly validate templates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted template file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website or file share (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website or file share. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

Alternatively, an attacker could launch a âMan-in-the-middleâ attack (intercept the traffic between source and destination) and modify the template contents to include malicious code.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office validates office templates prior to use.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Microsoft Office Integer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2470

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Office decreases an integer value beyond its intended minimum value. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles integer bounds checking.
