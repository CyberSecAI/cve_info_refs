Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-1767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error related to `TreeWalker` objects in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a `CTreeNode` object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that a memory location is accessed after it has been freed, potentially leading to corruption or arbitrary code execution.
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
- **User Rights:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the user running the vulnerable instance of Internet Explorer.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Malicious File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious file with embedded content.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may inject the exploit into compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting a malicious page or file.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability. The target user must visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- **Knowledge of Internet Explorer Vulnerability:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of the `TreeWalker` object vulnerability and how to trigger the use-after-free.

**Additional Details:**
- Microsoft released a security update (3076321) to address this vulnerability
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
- The vulnerability is related to how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically `CTreeNode` objects.
- The Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection using filter ID `20168`.
