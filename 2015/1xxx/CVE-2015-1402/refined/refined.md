Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure of the "Content Rating" (content_rating) TYPO3 extension to properly escape user input in both HTML and SQL contexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  The lack of proper HTML escaping allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- SQL Injection: The lack of proper SQL escaping allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- XSS: Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can result in session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- SQL Injection: Successful exploitation of the SQL Injection vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to or modification of data in the database. This could include reading sensitive information, adding, deleting or modifying records and potentially taking over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- XSS: Attackers can inject malicious code through user-supplied inputs, which are not properly sanitized when displayed on the web page.
- SQL Injection: Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the database by manipulating user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application through the vulnerable extension.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to know that the vulnerable extension is in use.

**Additional Details:**

-   The affected component is a third-party TYPO3 extension called "Content Rating" (content_rating). It is not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
-   The vulnerable versions are 1.0.3 and all versions below.
-   The extension author did not provide a security fix in a timely manner, leading to the removal of vulnerable versions from the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
-   The suggested action is to uninstall and delete the vulnerable extension.
-   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Steffen MÃ¼ller.
