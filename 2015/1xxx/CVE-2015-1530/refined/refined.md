{
  "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of memory allocation size for effect descriptors.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Integer Overflow",
    "Memory Allocation Size Calculation Error"
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability could potentially lead to a heap overflow due to an integer overflow during the memory allocation, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. ",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious audio session request with a large number of pre-processing effects, causing the count variable to overflow during memory allocation, and trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted audio session request with a high number of effects. This requires the ability to interact with the audio policy service. "
