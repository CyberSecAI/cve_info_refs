Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Exchange Server not properly sanitizing page content in Outlook Web App (OWA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in the "X-OWA-Canary" cookie. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the cookie contains a double quote ("), HTML markup, or JavaScript. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary script in the context of the current user. This script could then perform actions on the affected Outlook Web App site on behalf of the victim, with the same permissions as the current user. This could lead to information disclosure, account manipulation, or further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through two main vectors:
1.  **Email attack:** Sending an email message containing a specially crafted URL that, when clicked, directs the user to a malicious Outlook Web App site.
2.  **Web-based attack:** Hosting a website with a specially crafted URL that redirects the user to a malicious Outlook Web App site. Compromised or user-content hosting websites could also be used to host the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to:
1.  Craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `X-OWA-Canary` cookie.
2.  Convince the victim to click the crafted URL, leading them to the targeted (and potentially malicious) Outlook Web App site. This could be achieved via phishing emails or malicious websites.
3. Be able to either host a malicious site, or use compromised sites to redirect victims.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the OWA modified canary parameter.
- The vulnerability is categorized as an elevation of privilege vulnerability as it allows an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the victim.
- The provided document also mentions a workaround: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block requests to `<host>/owa/?ae=Item&t;=AD.RecipientType.User&id;=<id>` where the cookie "X-OWA-Canary" contains a double quote ("), HTML markup, or JavaScript.
