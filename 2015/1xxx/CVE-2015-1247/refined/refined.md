Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1247:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided information directly relates to CVE-2015-1247. Multiple sources, including the SUSE CVE page and the Chromium code review, mention it explicitly. The CVE description aligns with the root cause of the vulnerability found in the code review and the openSUSE advisory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of URLs used for OpenSearch descriptor XML documents in Google Chrome. Specifically, the `SearchEngineTabHelper::OnPageHasOSDD` function did not prevent the use of `file:` URLs, which could allow an attacker to point to a local file instead of a web resource.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of the OpenSearch descriptor URL. The code failed to check the scheme of the URL, allowing the usage of `file:` URLs.
- **Information Disclosure:** Allowing `file:` URLs in the OpenSearch descriptor can lead to information disclosure, as arbitrary local files could be accessed.
- **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** This bypasses the intended security restrictions of the browser by not limiting the search engine descriptors to HTTP/HTTPS URLs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local File Disclosure:** A remote attacker could potentially read the content of any file accessible to the user by embedding a specially crafted `file:` URL within an OpenSearch descriptor.
- **Information Leakage:** The disclosure of sensitive local information could be used to further attacks or identify system configurations.
- **No Code Execution:** The vulnerability itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, but can be a part of chain of exploits.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Website:** The primary attack vector is a malicious HTTP or HTTPS website.
- **OpenSearch Descriptor:** The website would host a specially crafted OpenSearch descriptor that references local files through file: URLs.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the malicious website for the attack to be effective.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Website:** The attacker needs a web server or platform to host their malicious HTML page and OpenSearch descriptor.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, which simplifies the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** Some level of social engineering might be required to entice a user to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Notes and Details:**
- The Chromium code review (issue 917313004) provides in-depth details about the patch for this vulnerability, including the discussion around whether `file:` URLs should be permitted for local testing.
- The SUSE and openSUSE advisories confirm that this vulnerability was fixed in Chromium 42.0.2311.90.
- The fix in Chromium was to explicitly check if the URL scheme is HTTP or HTTPS.
- The Debian security advisory DSA-3238-1 also lists this CVE as a security fix.
-The Red Hat bugzilla entry also describes the vulnerability, fixes and provides links to the related RHSA.

In summary, CVE-2015-1247 is a vulnerability caused by the lack of proper sanitization in handling URLs for OpenSearch descriptors, leading to potential local file disclosure via `file:` URLs, triggered by a user visiting a malicious website.
