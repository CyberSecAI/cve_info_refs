### @fixe **[fixe](/fixe)** commented [Jan 13, 2015](#issue-54141040)

Fixes [#2906](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2906).

Breaking change: it is mandatory to provide the order when using the array notation.

[@mickhansen](https://github.com/mickhansen) I think we should create an abstract query-generator test file and add the missing tests there. I can also check if the number of arguments in the array is 1 and keep the BC in that case. Thoughts?

Sorry, something went wrong.

This condition will never be true. When the `order` is sent as a string, we'll probably need to parse it and look for the *ASC*/*DESC* keywords no?

You are right, that condition will never be reached.

I'm not sure about parsing, i prefer people use the correct syntax (but don't we all)

Ideally this should still not be needed.

But not sure exactly how we would go about that.
