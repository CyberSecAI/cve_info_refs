Subject: CVE-Request -- Landsknecht Adminsystems v.4.0.1 (DEV, beta version)
 -- Reflecting XSS, unrestricted file-upload and underlaying CSRF

Hi Steve, Josh, vendors, list.

I found reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities, a unrestricted file-upload and
underlaying CSRF-vulnerabilities in CMS Landsknecht Adminsystems v. 4.0.1
(DEV, beta version).

Technical details:

=======================
Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities
=======================

A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the index.php and can be
abused via the vulnerable "page"-parameter. See the following example,
including exploit-example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?page=home%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&lang=de%27

Another reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the system.php-file
and can be exploited via the vulnerable "id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/asys/site/system.php?action=users_users&mode=edit&id=1%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

==================================
Unrestricted file-upload / Underlaying CSRF
==================================

Registered users and administrators are able to upload arbitrary files via
the following upload-form, located here:

http://{TARGET}/asys/site/files.php?action=upload&path=/

As there seems not be an existing permission-model, users can read/execute
files  an administrator/user uploaded and vice versa.

This issue includes an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability, as a user is able to
upload a malicious file and trick another user or the administrator into
visiting the link to the file.

All files get uploaded here without being renamed:

http://{TARGET}/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE}

Can I please have a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for this issue?

Thank you very much.

Greetings from Germany.

Steffen Rösemann

Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2015-1603 for both XSS issues.

Use CVE-2015-1604 for the "upload arbitrary files" issue.

The available information doesn't suggest that any of the behavior
would typically be considered a separate CSRF vulnerability. There is
no CVE ID for Landsknecht Adminsystems CSRF.

We think this means anyone can execute a file regardless of who
uploaded it. Do you mean that a file uploaded by a user can ONLY be
executed by an administrator or different user, whereas a file
uploaded by an administrator can ONLY be executed by a user?

We're not sure whether you mean the CSRF concept is relevant in a way
that is unusual for an "upload arbitrary files" issue.

If the attacker can upload a file, with the upload location and/or
file extension allowing execute access, then the typical outcome is
that exactly that file is executed. It is not typically the case that
a product modifies uploaded files to insert a CSRF protection
mechanism. Also, it is not typically the case that a pathname such as
/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE} would actually execute a wrapper program
(containing a CSRF protection mechanism) before executing
UPLOADED_FILE itself.

For these reasons, the ability to upload executable files to
/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE} would normally be considered a single
vulnerability, and would not lead to a conclusion that the product has
an independent CSRF problem.

Also, the primary threat model for "upload arbitrary files" issues is
that the file uploading and the file execution are done by the same
person. Certainly, it could be interesting to upload JavaScript code
and trick an administrator into executing it. However, if the attacker
can upload and execute PHP code without any tricking, ability to
upload JavaScript is usually not considered an independently relevant
problem. In common (but not all) cases, given an attacker's "upload
arbitrary files" ability, the entire class of scenarios in which the
file is later executed by a different person isn't independently
relevant.

So, we think one CVE for the two XSS issues, and one CVE for file
upload, is the correct number. Do you have another interpretation?

==========================

Landsknecht Adminsystems CMS v. 4.0.1 (DEV, beta version) suffers from
reflecting XSS- , unrestricted file-upload and an underlaying
CSRF-vulnerability.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

The content management system Landsknecht Adminsystems v. 4.0.1, which is
currently in beta development stage, suffers from reflecting
XSS-vulnerabilities, a unrestricted file-upload and an underlaying
CSRF-vulnerability.

==================
Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities
==================

A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the index.php and can be
abused via the vulnerable "page"-parameter. See the following example,
including exploit-example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?page=home%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&lang=de%27

Another reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the system.php-file
and can be exploited via the vulnerable "id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/asys/site/system.php?action=users_users&mode=edit&id=1%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

============================
Unrestricted file-upload / Underlaying CSRF
============================

Registered users and administrators are able to upload arbitrary files via
the following upload-form, located here:

<http://{TARGET}/asys/site/files.php?action=upload&path=/>

As there seems not be an existing permission-model, users can read/execute
files  an administrator/user uploaded and vice versa.

This issue includes an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability, as a user is able to
upload a malicious file and trick another user or the administrator into
visiting the link to the file.

All files get uploaded here without being renamed:

[http://{TARGET}/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE}](http://{TARGET}/upload/files/%7BUPLOADED_FILE%7D)

=========
Solution:
=========

The vendor has been notified. He will provide a fix for the vulnerabilities
to prevent people who might use it from being attacked, although he would
not recommend using the CMS because it is in its beta stage.

====================
Disclosure Timeline:
====================
30-Jan-2015 – found the vulnerabilities
30-Jan-2015 - informed the developers (see [3])
30-Jan-2015 – release date of this security advisory [without technical
details]

available for other security researchers (see [4])
12-Feb-2015 - release date of this security advisory
12-Feb-2015 - vendor will patch the vulnerabilities
12-Feb-2015 - send to FullDisclosure

## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Jan 30, 2015](https://github.com/AschauerMarvin/adminsystems/issues/1#issue-56087449)

Dear developer.

I found XSS-vulnerabilities, an unrestricted file-upload and an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability in your CMS Adminsystems v. 4.0.1 (DEV).

I am aware, that this content management system is currently in early development stage. If you are interested in the technical details to patch those vulnerabilities, please provide me an email-address, where I can send my informations of this issue to. Otherwise, if you don't mind, I can post the technical details here on Github directly.

I am releasing a security advisory on my blog without technical details, see here:

<http://sroesemann.blogspot.de/2015/01/sroeadv-2015-14.html>

Please contact me until 14th February 2015 (UTC+1) to exchange the informations about these vulnerabilities and to arrange a release-date for a patch and the technical information for my advisory, otherwise I will release the technical details as well on my blog and submit the issue to the security-mailinglist FullDisclosure, to track those bugs and warn potential users.

Greetings from Germany.

Steffen Rösemann
