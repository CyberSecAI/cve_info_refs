Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1603:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Landsknecht Adminsystems CMS. Specifically, the `page` parameter in `index.php` and the `id` parameter in `asys/site/system.php` are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the vulnerable parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to:
    *   Cookie theft.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Execution of arbitrary code within the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs with the vulnerable parameters containing XSS payloads.
*   The attacker then needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link. This can be done via:
    *   Email phishing.
    *   Social engineering.
    *   Malicious links on other websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting the crafted link, which can be a registered user or an administrator.
*   No other specific attacker capabilities or positions are mentioned.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Landsknecht Adminsystems CMS v. 4.0.1 (DEV, beta version).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.2.
*   The identified XSS vulnerabilities were assigned CVE-2015-1603, while the file upload vulnerability was assigned CVE-2015-1604.
