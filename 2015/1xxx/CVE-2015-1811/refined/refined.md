Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE) within Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** Jenkins was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) expansion. This means that when parsing XML documents, Jenkins would process external entities defined within the XML, potentially leading to arbitrary file access on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** By crafting malicious XML documents, an attacker could force Jenkins to retrieve arbitrary XML files on the server, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information located within or outside of the Jenkins system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Documents:** Attackers could create specially crafted XML documents containing malicious external entity definitions.
- **Feeding XML Data:** The attacker needs a way to feed this malicious XML data into Jenkins. The specific method of injecting XML data is not described in detail but implies some form of data processing pipeline that Jenkins uses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to pass XML data:** Attackers need the ability to send or inject XML data into Jenkins, triggering the vulnerable parsing process.
- No specific authentication or privilege level is mentioned in the vulnerability description, only that the attacker must have the ability to pass XML data to Jenkins.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was assigned a "critical" severity rating.
- The fix was included in Jenkins versions 1.600 and 1.596.1.
- The bug report on Red Hat Bugzilla confirms the vulnerability and the fix included in RHSA-2015:1844.
