    *   "Bug: 19385640."
    *   "Change-Id: Ia74b6f154c3437e1bfc9da78b773d64b16a7604"

Based on this commit message, here's the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is related to missing memory allocation checks within the `ISoundTriggerHwService` class, specifically in the `listModules()` method.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The code was missing checks for memory allocation failures. This could lead to a crash if the system is unable to allocate memory, which can be exploited by an attacker by causing out-of-memory conditions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a crash in the `ISoundTriggerHwService`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could potentially trigger this issue by sending requests or manipulating the system to induce the `listModules()` method to attempt an allocation that will fail (e.g. by exhausting available resources).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to interact with the sound trigger service to invoke the `listModules` function. It is not clearly stated in the commit message if this interface is available remotely or locally.

This commit message provides more detail than the typical CVE description. It indicates the precise location of the issue within the `ISoundTriggerHwService` and its `listModules()` method, which is not usually included in a CVE.

**Summary:**

*   **Root cause:** Missing memory allocation checks in `ISoundTriggerHwService::listModules()`.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of handling for memory allocation failures.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) via crash.
*   **Attack vector:** Inducing the `listModules` method to attempt a failed memory allocation.
*   **Attacker position:** Need to interact with the sound trigger service.
