## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[CVE-2015-1258 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1258)

#### Description

Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 relies on libvpx code that was not built with an appropriate --size-limit value, which allows remote attackers to trigger a negative value for a size field, and consequently cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted frame size in VP9 video data.

WebAudioCapturerSource registers with a blink WebMediaStreamSource. When the audio track was stopped, the WebAudioCapturerSource was destroyed and the WebMediaStreamSource was left with a dangling pointer, which it tried to use, resulting in access to freed memory and usually a crashed tab. This CL makes WebAudioCapturerSource aware of the WebMediaStreamSource with which it is registered, so that it can be deregistered when the audio track is stopped.

Moreover, in the GC case, the object is destroyed anyway by a call to the Stop() method. Stop() in this case is invoked by the destructor of WebRtcLocalAudioTrack, which owns the WebAudioCapturerSource. That destructor also has a DCHECK to ensure execution in the main thread.  In a separate patch I also made WebAudioCapturerSource a scoped_ptr instead of a scoped_refptr. It seems to work, but it's not really necessary to fix this bug. Should I integrate it in this patch? ```     | **perkj\_chrome** | | thanks lgtm I think you should keep the cls separate. | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-10 12:31:55 UTC) [#9](#msg9) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` thanks lgtm I think you should keep the cls separate. ```     | **Guido Urdaneta** | | The CQ bit was checked by guidou@chromium.org | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-10 12:57:22 UTC) [#10](#msg10) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was checked by guidou@chromium.org ```     | **Guido Urdaneta** | | The patchset sent to the CQ was uploaded after l-g-t-m from henrika@chromium.org Link to the ... | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-10 12:57:22 UTC) [#11](#msg11) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The patchset sent to the CQ was uploaded after l-g-t-m from henrika@chromium.org Link to the patchset: <https://codereview.chromium.org/1071063005/#ps80001> (title: "Add thread check to WebAudioCapturerSourcer destructor") ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | CQ is trying da patch.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/05/stable-channel-update_19.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, May 19, 2015

The Chrome team is happy to announce the promotion of Chrome 43 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 43.0.2357.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements.  A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/42.0.2311.0..43.0.2357.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M43&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[489518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489518)] CVE-2015-1265: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.3 branch (currently 4.3.61.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
