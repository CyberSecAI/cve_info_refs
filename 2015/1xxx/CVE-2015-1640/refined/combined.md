## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3052044)

Published: April 14, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office server and productivity software. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sends a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the victimâs browser.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013.

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3052044](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3052044).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple SharePoint XSS Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when SharePoint Server improperly sanitizes a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. The attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the victimâs browser.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.
