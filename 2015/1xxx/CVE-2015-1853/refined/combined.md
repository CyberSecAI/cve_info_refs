| [Description](#c0)  horatio    2004-06-20 21:17:49 UTC  ``` Attached is jpgraph-1.15.ebuild, an update to dev-php/jpgraph-1.12.2.ebuild.   jpgraph is a graphing library for PHP, and version 1.12.2 dates from some time around mid-2003. One of my employers abruptly needed the latest version installed yesterday, hence...  The only real change is an updated SRC_URI (only versions 1.14 and below seem to be available from the original SRC_URI). When stuck into my portage tree and fed through emerge, it appears to work properly, but randomly prints "apache2" at odd points during the emerge, which I will leave to someone more experienced to debug. It seems harmless, certainly the installed library works as it should. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  horatio    2004-06-20 21:19:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 33727](attachment.cgi?id=33727 "the ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=33727&action=edit "the ebuild")] the ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  horatio    2004-06-20 21:20:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 33728](attachment.cgi?id=33728 "files/digest-jpgraph-1.15") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=33728&action=edit "files/digest-jpgraph-1.15")] files/digest-jpgraph-1.15 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ramon    2004-07-08 08:59:22 UTC  ``` I tried this ebuild.. It lists a dependency for >=dev-media/libgd-1.8 This should be >=dev-media/gd-1.8  Otherwise it worked fine.. The ebuild could do with an einfo part about  not working when mod_php has no gd support  and the location of the configuration file. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tal Peer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-31 08:23:20 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 52194](show_bug.cgi?id=52194 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - dev-php/jpgraph-1.15 version bump") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sebastian Bergmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-16 23:34:10 UTC  ``` dev-php/jpgraph-1.17 is in portage now. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-17 02:59:20 UTC  ``` I cannot download it from any mirror... ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sebastian Bergmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-17 07:31:33 UTC  ``` I updated the SRC_URI in the ebuild.  After an "emerge sync" (in 30 to 60 minutes from now) it should work. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-17 07:48:15 UTC  ``` OK, maybe it would work if the file was actually there. :-)  >>> Downloading <http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/downloads/jpgraph-1.17.tar.gz> --16:45:50--  <http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/downloads/jpgraph-1.17.tar.gz>            => `/usr/portage/distfiles/jpgraph-1.17.tar.gz' Resolving www.aditus.nu... 62.119.28.104 Connecting to www.aditus.nu[62.119.28.104]:80... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found 16:45:50 ERROR 404: Not Found.  This is the correct URI:  <http://members.chello.se/jpgraph/jpgdownloads/jpgraph-1.17.tar.gz> ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Sebastian Bergmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-17 09:58:27 UTC  ``` The ebuild has its SRC_URI set to [http://members.chello.se/jpgraph/jpgdownloads/${P}.tar.gz](http://members.chello.se/jpgraph/jpgdownloads/%24%7BP%7D.tar.gz), which is correct.  "emerge jpgraph" downloaded the file jpgraph-1.17.tar.gz just fine for me.  Did you "emerge sync"? If you did, your rsync mirror might not have had the updated ebuild. ``` |  |
