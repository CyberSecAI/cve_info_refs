I finally decided to uninstall this plugin for which I paid a huge 99$ amount.
Although I knew for some time already, that it was no more actively supported, it was apparently working on my website.
However, following several page speed tests, I recently discovered that the generated sliders are not leveraging wordpress thumbnails, and instead, are loading the images in original size, thus reducing tremendously the page loading size !
Of course, since there is no developer working on it anymore, I have no hope of having this issue fixed.
Having looked for an alternative in the plugins library, I found another one which does the job perfectly, is actively supported, and only costs 24$.

I tried numerous Sliders (6 in total, all with good reviews and updated recently),
some would not autoplay on iOS,
some would incorrectly re-size, or worse ‚Äì crop the height of images on iOS
some had too few options ‚Äì such as not being able to hide navigation arrows.
This is the only Slider plugin that actually worked for me, both on desktop browsers and mobile iOS devices.
Tested free version, working very well indeed, may now consider the upgrade.

Hi Matthew!
Thanks a lot for this plugin.
I‚Äôve been searching for a simple and lightweight slider plugin with post shortcode functionality among bloated 150kb+ (only fricking js) multipurpose solutions (and some of them used inline css (facepalm) ) for hours and finally!
I was surprised to see you‚Äôve managed to keep it at 34kb (css+js) size. Amazing.
It fits really nice in admin panel and doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äòfancy‚Äô unnecessary design or ads.
My go to choice from now.

It‚Äôs ok. There have been some issues by upgrading from V2 to V3, but I hope it does brake again now üôÇ

I used this slider on 7 sites for 6 years and never once had a single problem with it. Easing Slider is very easy to set up, its features make it flexible for different situations and the support is just absolutely SUPERB. But then recently Wordfence started flagging it because it hadn‚Äôt been updated after a WordPress update. And then another WordPress update slid past, and then another‚Ä¶ So ‚Äì I have reluctantly begun replacing EasingSlider on each of my sites with another slider, which is nowhere as elegant as EasingSlider. Very sorry to see EasingSlider go.
