Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `CJBig2_Image::expand` function within `fxcodec/jbig2/JBig2_Image.cpp` in PDFium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The `expand` function calculates the size of a buffer to allocate. Due to insufficient checks, it is possible to cause an integer overflow when multiplying the `height` and `stride` values.
*   The integer overflow results in a smaller-than-expected buffer being allocated
*    The smaller buffer then becomes the target of a heap-based buffer overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, causing a crash and potentially denying service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The CVE description indicates a possibility of "unspecified other impact", suggesting that, in some circumstances, an attacker might be able to leverage the memory corruption to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDF Document:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF document containing large values for height and stride, which causes an integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network accessible as malicous PDF documents can be served to a client using the vulnerable browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to deliver the malicious PDF to the target.
*   **Renderer Process Access:** The attacker leverages access to a renderer process that handles PDF documents, therefore a malicious website could trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Crafting Ability:** The attacker needs the capability to create or modify PDF documents with the specific malicious parameters.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the PDFium library, which is used in Google Chrome and other software.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Google Chrome version 44.0.2403.89, which contains the fix from commit `ffd6dce453db7f2f3d636ee6cb0d91bd700e6dc9` from PDFium.
*   The fix includes adding checks to prevent an integer overflow, and verifying that a new buffer size is larger than an older size.
