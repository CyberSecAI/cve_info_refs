  "CVE-2015-1240": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the WebGL implementation of Google Chrome. Specifically, the issue lies within the gpu/blink/webgraphicscontext3d_impl.cc file where a state inconsistency can be triggered via a crafted WebGL program.",
    "root_cause": "A state inconsistency between what Chrome thinks and what the graphics driver is using, which is caused when Chrome intercepts an invalid program and generates an error during LinkProgram instead of passing it to the driver. The driver therefore might still have a valid program from the previous successful link.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read",
      "State inconsistency"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted WebGL program"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted WebGL program and serve it to a user. No specific user interaction is needed, only that the victim loads the malicious page in a vulnerable browser version."
