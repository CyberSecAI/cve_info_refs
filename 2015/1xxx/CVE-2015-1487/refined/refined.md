Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-1487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The exploit leverages three vulnerabilities in Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager: an authentication bypass, a directory traversal, and a privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The module bypasses authentication, likely through the `ResetPassword` action, allowing access without valid credentials.
2.  **Directory Traversal:** A directory traversal vulnerability allows writing files outside of the intended web application directory by manipulating the `PackageFile` parameter.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:**  The module leverages an insecure method (`SemLaunchService.getInstance().execute`) to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, effectively gaining full control of the machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is carried out remotely over HTTP/HTTPS. The attacker sends a series of requests to the vulnerable `ConsoleServlet`:
1.  Bypass authentication by using the `ResetPassword` action.
2.  Upload a malicious executable (payload) using the directory traversal flaw by manipulating the `PackageFile` parameter of the `BinaryFile` action.
3.  Upload a JSP file containing code that uses the vulnerable `SemLaunchService` class to execute the uploaded executable.
4.  Access the uploaded JSP file to trigger code execution of the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager server.
2.  The attacker does not need any prior valid credentials due to the authentication bypass vulnerability.
