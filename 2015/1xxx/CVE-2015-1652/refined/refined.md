- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities that can lead to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website or inject malicious content into compromised websites. The attacker would then need to convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically through links in emails or instant messages, or by enticing them to open a malicious email attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince the user to visit the site using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
