- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption, leading to potential remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage or open a malicious attachment. Attackers can achieve this through phishing emails or compromised websites hosting malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or control a website with malicious content or create a malicious attachment. They also need to persuade the victim to visit the website or open the attachment through social engineering.
