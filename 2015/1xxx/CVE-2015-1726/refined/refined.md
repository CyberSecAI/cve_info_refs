Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1726:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Windows kernel, specifically related to the handling of brush objects. A brush object is freed in the `NtGdiDeleteObjectApp` call, but a reference to this freed memory is held within the THREADINFO object at offset +0x10. The vulnerable code is in `HmgAllocateObjectAttr` which is called in multiple locations, and uses the freed memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The kernel is accessing memory that has already been freed. This can lead to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, granting them elevated privileges. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Denial of Service: While the primary impact is elevation of privilege, a denial-of-service can also occur by crashing the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to execute code on the system.
- Specially crafted application: The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to log on to the system and execute programs. They don't need any special privileges or network access.
