- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Attackers can intercept or modify Siemens industrial communications at port 102/tcp due to a lack of cryptographic protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Man-in-the-Middle vulnerability arising from insufficient cryptographic protections for network communication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to intercept or modify communications between PLCs and their partners, leading to potential manipulation of industrial processes or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based, specifically by intercepting communications at TCP port 102.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need access to the network path between PLCs and their communication partners.
