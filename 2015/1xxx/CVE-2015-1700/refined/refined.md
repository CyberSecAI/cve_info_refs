Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-1700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of specially crafted page content by Microsoft SharePoint Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied page content. Specifically, the SharePoint server fails to properly validate and cleanse page content before processing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target SharePoint server.
- The attacker can run arbitrary code within the security context of the W3WP service account, potentially gaining complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is sending specially crafted page content to a SharePoint server. This would likely involve manipulating input fields or parameters of a web page within SharePoint.
- An authenticated user is required to exploit this vulnerability, however, anonymous access on a SharePoint server would bypass this mitigating factor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the target SharePoint site. Anonymous access to the site bypasses this requirement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft SharePoint Server, including 2007, 2010, and 2013.
- The provided document references Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-047 which addresses this vulnerability.
- The fix involves correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes specially crafted page content.
- The vulnerability was reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and there was no public evidence of exploitation at the time of the bulletin release.
- No workarounds are identified in this document.
