- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of opcode 1331 within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A command injection vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper input validation when processing opcode 1331. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server under the context of the SYSTEM user. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted packet on TCP port 11460 to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need network access to the vulnerable server on TCP port 11460.
