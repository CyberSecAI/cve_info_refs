{
  "CVE-2015-1600": {
    "Description": "The Netatmo weather station transmits the WPA passphrase in cleartext to the cloud during initial setup for debugging purposes.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The weather station's firmware was configured to transmit debug information, including the WPA passphrase, in cleartext to a remote server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (WPA passphrase).",
      "Unnecessary transmission of sensitive data to a third party (Netatmo).",
      "Lack of encryption of transmitted data."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could intercept the transmitted passphrase during the initial setup of the weather station.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack on the local network during the initial setup.",
       "Passive network sniffing on the local network"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Ability to eavesdrop on network traffic between the weather station and the internet during initial setup.",
        "Being on the same local network."
      ],
     "Additional Information": "The issue was fixed by Netatmo in a firmware update (version 101 for the 'indoor module') which removes the debug information transmission."
