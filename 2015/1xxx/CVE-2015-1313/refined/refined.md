The provided content relates to CVE-2015-1313.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the user account registration function at `/registerUserSubmit.html` is still accessible and functional even when the administrator disables new user registration through the application's configuration settings. The registration page does not respect the administrator's configuration setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure direct object reference: The `/registerUserSubmit.html` endpoint is directly accessible even when it should be disabled by administrator settings.
- Failure to properly enforce access control: The application fails to enforce the administrator's setting to disable new user registration at the backend.
- Client-side cryptography weakness: Cryptographic keys used for password encryption during registration are available in the browser's source, allowing an attacker to forge a valid registration request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized account creation: Attackers can create new user accounts despite administrative controls designed to prevent this.
- Unauthorized access: Newly created accounts grant attackers access to the TeamCity server and its resources.
- Potential data exfiltration: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information, such as source code, from the system.
- Potential remote code execution: Depending on the configuration, new users may gain the ability to execute builds and modify configurations, potentially resulting in remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct request: Attackers can directly access the `/registerUserSubmit.html` endpoint.
- Browser exploitation: By injecting a javascript into the web browser, the login form can be turned into a registration form, using the cryptographic keys available on the login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the TeamCity server.
- Ability to interact with the login page of the TeamCity application.
- Basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, JavaScript).
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within the victim's browser (through the console).
