The provided content relates to CVE-2015-1728.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Windows Media Player handles specially crafted DataObjects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper handling of DataObjects within Windows Media Player.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution, gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted DataObject within Windows Media Player.  In a web-based attack scenario, the attacker would host the malicious DataObject on a website and convince the user to visit the site, typically through a link in an email or instant message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to create a specially crafted DataObject and host it on a website, or otherwise convince a user to open the malicious file using Windows Media Player.  No special permissions are needed on the victim system for the exploit to occur, but users with fewer permissions are less impacted.
