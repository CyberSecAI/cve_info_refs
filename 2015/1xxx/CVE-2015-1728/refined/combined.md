## Vulnerability in Windows Media Player Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3033890)

Published: June 9, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Player opens specially crafted media content that is hosted on a malicious website. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Windows Media Player 10 when installed on Windows Server 2003, Windows Media Player 11 when installed on Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, and Windows Media Player 12 when installed on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Player handles DataObjects. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Media Player RCE via DataObject Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1728

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows Media Player handles specially crafted DataObjects. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability a user must open a specially crafted DataObject in Windows Media Player. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Player handles DataObjects.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Remove wmplayer.exe from the Internet Explorer ElevationPolicy**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To remove Windows Media Player from the Internet Explorer ElevationPolicy, follow these steps:

  1. Run regedit.exe and expand the following registry subkey:

     ```
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Low Rights\ElevationPolicy

     ```
  2. Select **{6bf52a52-394a-11d3-b153-00c04f79faa6}**.
  3. Click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  4. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **wmplayer.exe\_backup.reg**, and then click **Save**.
  5. Click the **File** menu, select **Delete**, and then click **Yes**.
  6. Log off and log on again, or restart the system.

**How to undo the workaround.**

1. Run regedit.exe
2. Click the **File** menu and select **Import**.
3. In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select **wmplayer.exe\_backup.reg**, and then click **Open**.

### FAQ

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted DataObject in Windows Media Player.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a specially crafted DataObject that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any system using an affected version of Windows Media Player is at risk from this vulnerability.
