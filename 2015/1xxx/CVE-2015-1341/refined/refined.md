Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Apport's incorrect handling of Python module imports. Specifically, when determining the path of a Python module for a command like `python -m module_name`, Apport would actually import and run the module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Module Import:** Apport was not properly sanitizing or validating the module path before importing and executing it.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By importing and running the module, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apport process which runs as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on the affected system. This means they could execute any command, modify system files, and have complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Python Module Import Manipulation:** The attacker would need to be able to influence the python module being imported.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user account with the ability to execute commands and influence the python module being imported.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Gabriel Campana.
* The fix implemented in the patched versions of apport avoids importing and running the module by not relying on python to resolve the path.

This vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Ubuntu, and patched versions were released to correct the issue as detailed in the USN-2782-1 advisory.
