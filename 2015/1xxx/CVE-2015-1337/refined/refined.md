Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in Simple Streams' insufficient verification of GPG signatures. Specifically, if an image file is returned within the body of a 403 HTTP response instead of a standard 200 response, Simple Streams fails to verify the GPG signature, yet still treats the image as verified and returns it to the caller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient GPG verification:** The primary weakness is that Simple Streams does not properly validate GPG signatures when the image is served with a 403 HTTP response.
*   **Bypass of Authentication:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to bypass the intended GPG signature verification process.
*   **Reliance on HTTP Status Codes:** The vulnerability is triggered by the server responding with a specific HTTP status code (403) which the client-side code did not handle properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Image Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary, malicious disk images into a client system.
*   **Compromised Systems:** By injecting malicious images, an attacker can compromise the client system, potentially leading to a wide range of attacks.
*   **Machine-in-the-middle attack:** If the client isn't using HTTPS, a machine-in-the-middle attack can achieve the same malicious image injection.
*   **Compromise of OpenStack Images:** The vulnerability can be used to compromise images registered in Glance, an OpenStack component, leading to a widespread compromise in a production OpenStack environment.
*   **MAAS image download issues:** The initial fix for this vulnerability also caused a regression preventing MAAS from downloading PXE images.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Mirror:**  An attacker can operate a malicious mirror that returns image files within a 403 response.
*   **Machine-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned in the network path can perform a MitM attack, modifying responses and injecting malicious images, if the client is using unencrypted HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve HTTP Content:** The attacker needs the capability to serve HTTP content, either by operating a malicious mirror or by intercepting network traffic.
*   **Network Position (for MitM):** For a MitM attack, the attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the client and the image server.
*   **Knowledge of Simple Streams:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how Simple Streams works and how to exploit the lack of signature verification under specific HTTP conditions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Simple Streams versions used by Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid), Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (Trusty) and Ubuntu Wily.
*   Patches were released for affected versions of Ubuntu, fixing the vulnerability and addressing the regression introduced by the initial fix.
*   The fix involves ensuring that users of the `BasicMirrorWriter` get exceptions when importing data with invalid checksums or sizes by using a 'ChecksummingContentSource'. It also provides a backwards compatible behavior via the setting `SS_MISSING_ITEM_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR=silent`
*   A script to reproduce the vulnerability was provided in the bug report.
