Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of long heartbeat messages within VMware vCenter Server's `vpxd` service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient input validation or sanitization of heartbeat messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in the `vpxd` service. This would likely render the vCenter Server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote. An attacker would send specially crafted long heartbeat messages to the vCenter Server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can be remote and unauthenticated, only requiring network access to the vulnerable vCenter Server.

**Affected Product and Versions:**

*   VMware vCenter Server versions:
    *   5.0 prior to 5.0u3e
    *   5.1 prior to 5.1u3
    *   5.5 prior to 5.5u2
    *   vCenter Server 6.0 is not affected

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply patches as indicated:
    *   vCenter Server 5.0: Update to 5.0u3e.
    *   vCenter Server 5.1: Update to 5.1u3.
    *   vCenter Server 5.5: Update to 5.5u2.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-1047 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server, caused by a lack of proper input validation of heartbeat messages. An unauthenticated attacker can send crafted messages to cause a denial of service.
