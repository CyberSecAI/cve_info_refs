##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware ESXi OpenSLP Remote Code Execution

VMware ESXi contains a double free flaw in OpenSLP's SLPDProcessMessage() function. Exploitation of this issue may allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code on the ESXi host.

VMware would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-5177 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

non-security issue and provides a solution.*

b. VMware vCenter Server JMX RMI Remote Code Execution

VMware vCenter Server contains a remotely accessible JMX RMI service that is
not securely configured. An unauthenticated remote attacker who is able
to connect to the service may be able to use it to execute arbitrary
code on the vCenter Server. A local attacker may be able to elevate
their privileges on vCenter Server.

vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) 5.1, 5.5 and 6.0 has remote access to the JMX RMI service (port 9875) blocked by default.

VMware would like to thank Doug McLeod of 7 Elements Ltd and an anonymous
researcher working through HP's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this
issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-2342 to this issue.

**CRITICAL UPDATE**

VMSA-2015-0007.2 and earlier versions of this advisory documented that CVE-2015-2342 was addressed in vCenter Server 5.0 U3e, 5.1 U3b, and 5.5 U3. Subsequently, it was found that the fix for CVE-2015-2342 in vCenter Server 5.0 U3e, 5.1 U3b, and 5.5 U3/U3a/U3b running on Windows was incomplete and did
not address the issue.

In order to address the issue on these versions of vCenter Server Windows, an
additional patch must be installed. This additional patch is available
from VMware Knowledge Base (KB) article 2144428.

In case the Windows Firewall is enabled on the system that has vCenter
Server Windows installed, remote exploitation of CVE-2015-2342 is not
possible. Even if the Windows Firewall is enabled, users are advised to
install the additional patch in order to remove the local privilege
elevation.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

installed on vCenter Server Windows 5.0 U3e, 5.1 U3b, 5.5 U3, 5.5 U3a,
and 5.5 U3b in order to remediate CVE-2015-2342.

 This patch is not needed when updating to 5.0 U3g, 5.1
U3d or 5.5 U3d, or when installing 5.0 U3g, 5.1 U3d or 5.5 U3d.

c. VMware vCenter Server vpxd denial-of-service vulnerability

VMware vCenter Server does not properly sanitize long
 heartbeat messages. Exploitation of this issue may allow an
unauthenticated attacker to create a denial-of-service condition in the
vpxd service.

VMware would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-1047 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
