Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain data passed from user mode to the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically win32k.sys). This lack of validation allows a crafted application to cause a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the win32k.sys driver. This occurs when the driver attempts to access memory through a pointer that has a null value, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **System Compromise:** Once in kernel mode, the attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker must execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials to access the system.
- **Local Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute a program on the targeted system.

**Additional details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit involves creating a new window station and manipulating clipboard operations.
- The issue occurs during the cleanup of window station objects, where a window's last reference is held by the clipboard. This leads to the destruction of the window object when thread information is already null, which is then used in `xxxDestroyWindow`.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates that the null page can be mapped in user mode and accessed from kernel mode.
- The exploit demonstrated a write to a chosen memory location through `win32k!HMChangeOwnerThread+0x40`.

**Workaround (Windows 7 Only):**
- Disable NULL page mapping using the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\EnableLowVaAccess` to a value of 0. This workaround comes with the potential impact of breaking some 16-bit applications.

In summary, CVE-2015-1721 is a critical vulnerability because it allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges to kernel level.
