- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) improperly verifying impersonation levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper verification of impersonation levels in the SCM allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges, potentially allowing them to make calls to the SCM for which they lack sufficient privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must first log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to log on to the system and run a program.
