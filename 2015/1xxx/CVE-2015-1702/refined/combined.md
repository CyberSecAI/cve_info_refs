## Vulnerability in Service Control Manager Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3055642)

Published: May 12, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), which is caused when SCM improperly verifies impersonation levels. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker can first log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the SCM verifies impersonation levels. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3055642](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3055642).

[1]Windows Server 2003 is affected, but an update is not being issued for it. See the **Update FAQ** for more information.

[2]This update is available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130) only.

## Update FAQ

**Windows Server 2003 is listed as an affected product; why is Microsoft not issuing an update for it?**

Although Windows Server 2003 is an affected product, Microsoft is not issuing an update for it because the comprehensive architectural changes required would jeopardize system stability and cause application compatibility problems. Microsoft recommends that security-conscious customers upgrade to a later operating system in order to keep pace with the changing security threat landscape and benefit from the more robust protections that later operating systems provide.

## Vulnerability Information

## Service Control Manager Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1702

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) when the SCM improperly verifies impersonation levels. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and make calls to SCM for which they lack sufficient privilege. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the SCM verifies impersonation levels.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this to occur.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
