- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack buffer overflow in the `FXCLI_OraBR_Exec_Command` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of a crafted packet.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted packet sent over TCP port 11460 triggers the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication.
