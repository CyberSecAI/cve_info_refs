grep -F: fix a heap buffer (read) overrungrep's read buffer is often filled to its full size, except when
reading the final buffer of a file. In that case, the number of
bytes read may be far less than the size of the buffer. However, for
certain unusual pattern/text combinations, grep -F would mistakenly
examine bytes in that uninitialized region of memory when searching
for a match. With carefully chosen inputs, one can cause grep -F to
read beyond the end of that buffer altogether. This problem arose via
commit v2.18-90-g73893ff with the introduction of a more efficient
heuristic using what is now the memchr\_kwset function. The use of
that function in bmexec\_trans could leave TP much larger than EP,
and the subsequent call to bm\_delta2\_search would mistakenly access
beyond end of the main input read buffer.
\* src/kwset.c (bmexec\_trans): When TP reaches or exceeds EP,
do not call bm\_delta2\_search.
\* tests/kwset-abuse: New file.
\* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
\* THANKS.in: Update.
\* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.
Prior to this patch, this command would trigger a UMR:
printf %0360db 0 | valgrind src/grep -F $(printf %019dXb 0)
Use of uninitialised value of size 8

See the accompanying test for how to trigger the heap buffer overrun.
Thanks to Nima Aghdaii for testing and finding numerous
ways to break early iterations of this patch.

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;msg=5;bug=19563) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Colleagues Nima Aghdaii and Yuliy Pisetsky found and fixed a heap
buffer overrun in grep's kwset.c.  The underlying bug, already hard to
trigger, would most often result in a "mere" heap UMR (uninitialized
memory read), but Yuliy constructed inputs (see the new test) that
cause a buffer overrun.

I'm attaching two other related patches:
  - grep: avoid false-positive UMR
  - tests: add support for ASAN memory poisoning

I expect to push these by Monday.

```

How about the following instead?

#ifndef __has_feature
# define __has_feature(a) false
#endif

#if defined __SANITIZE_ADDRESS__ || __has_feature (address_sanitizer)
# define HAVE_ASAN 1
#else
# define HAVE_ASAN 0
#endif

This is what Emacs uses (its symbol is ADDRESS_SANITIZER instead of HAVE_ASAN,
for what that's worth).

The two 'sizeof's need spaces afterwards.

I don't see the value of having macros here.  How about the following instead?

#ifndef HAVE_ASAN
static void
__asan_unpoison_memory_region (void const volatile *addr, size_t size)
{
}

static void
__asan_unpoison_memory_region (void const volatile *addr, size_t size)
{
}
#endif

And then have the callers invoke '__asan_poison_memory_region' instead of
'ASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION'.  This way, there should be no need to pull in the
ignore-value machinery, it's two less macros to worry about, and there's better
type checking when address sanitization is not in use.

I agree.  Adjusted via s/unpoison/poison/ in the first.
In addition, I have added _GL_UNUSED so as not to run afoul of grep's
use of -Werror=unused-function. Also, I have adapted not to
declare when using the static wrappers.

and to use #if, not #ifndef, since now HAVE_ASAN is always defined.

Thank you for the suggestion.

However, I do not see a problem with Yuliy's fix, so have pushed it,
along with the other two commits.

Comparing your change to Yuliy's, I have a slight preference
for his, since it adds work only to the rarely-used code path on
which this bug was introduced, and keeps the handling of
"out of bounds TP" closer to the code that makes TP too large.

If you can provide justification for this proposed change,
would you please do so in the commit log of a rebased patch?

I understood.  However, if fill d == 0 before reach in memchr(), even if
fill ep <= tp, bm_delta2_search() can be called, and it is not buggy.
So It is difficult for me to understand that we must exit the loop if
tp <= ep  at the point, although I understand that his fix is correct.

Thanks for checking. I've just confirmed that backing out that fix and
running kwset-abuse does trigger a segfault on a rawhide x86-64
system, but not on a debian unstable (also x86-64) system. The
trouble is that the test case is sensitive to the implementation
details of the allocator and system details like page size. The test
case was designed to trigger the segfault, given a particular
observed behavior. If you can tune the test to trigger a failure
on your system, I'd be happy to accept a patch that adds
another case for that.

Hi,

I'm running kwset-abuse test, but I don't get any difference with or
without the fix for this CVE (in kwset.c). Do you think there is an
issue with the test? Maybe something related to my platform?

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated grep packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The grep utility searches through textual input for lines that contain a
match to a specified pattern and then prints the matching lines. The GNU
grep utilities include grep, egrep, and fgrep.

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way grep parsed large lines of data. An attacker able to trick
a user into running grep on a specially crafted data file could use this
flaw to crash grep or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running grep. (CVE-2012-5667)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way grep processed
certain pattern and text combinations. An attacker able to trick a user
into running grep on specially crafted input could use this flaw to crash
grep or, potentially, read from uninitialized memory. (CVE-2015-1345)

The grep packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.20, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
Notably, the speed of various operations has been improved significantly.
Now, the recursive grep utility uses the fts function of the gnulib library
for directory traversal, so that it can handle much larger directories
without reporting the "File name too long" error message, and it can
operate faster when dealing with large directory hierarchies. (BZ#982215,
BZ#1064668, BZ#1126757, BZ#1167766, BZ#1171806)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the \w and \W symbols were inconsistently matched

to the [:alnum:] character class. Consequently, regular expressions that used \w
and \W in some cases had incorrect results. An upstream patch which fixes the
matching problem has been applied, and \w is now matched to the [\_[:alnum:]]
character and \W to the [^\_[:alnum:]] character consistently. (BZ#799863)

* Previously, the "--fixed-regexp" command-line option was not included in

the grep(1) manual page. Consequently, the manual page was inconsistent
with the built-in help of the grep utility. To fix this bug, grep(1) has
been updated to include a note informing the user that "--fixed-regexp" is
an obsolete option. Now, the built-in help and manual page are consistent
regarding the "--fixed-regexp" option. (BZ#1103270)

* Previously, the Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library did not

work correctly when matching non-UTF-8 text in UTF-8 mode. Consequently, an
error message about invalid UTF-8 byte sequence characters was returned.
To fix this bug, patches from upstream have been applied to the PCRE
library and the grep utility. As a result, PCRE now skips non-UTF-8
characters as non-matching text without returning any error message.
(BZ#1193030)

All grep users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.
