- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, which is a SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries through malformed input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the application and its data files. This could result in privilege escalation and access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves supplying malformed input to the AMS Device Manager software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the AMS Device Manager software and supply it with crafted malicious input. The attacker requires medium skill to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires user interaction, but not necessarily authenticated user interaction.
