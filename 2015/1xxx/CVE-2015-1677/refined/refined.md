The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS15-051) that discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-1677.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2015-1677, along with other similar CVEs (CVE-2015-1676, CVE-2015-1678, CVE-2015-1679, CVE-2015-1680) is that the Windows kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue where private address information is leaked from the kernel memory. This is due to the kernel-mode driver improperly handling objects in memory, specifically during a function call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain information about the system's memory layout, revealing kernel memory contents. This could expose sensitive information. Although this vulnerability does not allow for arbitrary code execution by itself, it can be combined with another vulnerability to bypass security features, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a local attack that exploits the memory disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability can not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system. They also need a separate vulnerability to leverage the memory layout information gained from this disclosure. The attacker would need valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally.
