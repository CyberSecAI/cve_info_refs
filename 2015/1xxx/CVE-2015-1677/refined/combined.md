## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3057191)

Published: May 12, 2015 | Updated: May 27, 2015

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on locally and runs arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3057191](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3057191).

## Affected Software

## Update FAQ

**Why are some of the update files listed in this bulletin also denoted in other bulletins being released in May?**

Several of the update files listed in this bulletin are also denoted in other bulletins being released in May due to overlaps in affected software. Although the different bulletins address separate security vulnerabilities, the security updates have been consolidated where possible and appropriate. Therefore some identical update files are present in multiple bulletins.

Note that identical update files being released with multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when the Windows kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call, which could allow the disclosure of kernel memory contents revealing information about the system to an attacker. The information disclosure vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use them in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

Microsoft received information about these vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1676](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1676) | No | No |
| Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1677](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1677) | No | No |
| Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1678](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1678) | No | No |
| Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1679](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1679) | No | No |
| Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1680](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1680) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1701

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the [Win32k.sys](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Revisions

* V1.0 (May 12, 2015): Bulletin published.
* V2.0 (May 27, 2015): Bulletin revised to announce the availability of a new update (3065979) that fixes a known issue that some customers experienced after installing the 3045171 security update on all supported editions of Windows 7/Windows 2008 R2 and earlier systems. The 3045171 security update causes customer applications to crash while attempting to create text-outline-based path objects using GDI+. Customers who are experiencing this known issue can correct the problem by installing the 3065979 update. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3065979](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3065979) for more information and download links.
