Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a failure in the VBScript engine to properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This allows an attacker to predict memory offsets, a crucial step in many exploits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The primary weakness is the failure to utilize ASLR, which would otherwise make memory locations unpredictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** By itself, this vulnerability does not grant arbitrary code execution but bypasses an important security mitigation.
- **Enables More Reliable Exploits:**  The primary impact is that it makes other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution, significantly easier to exploit by allowing reliable prediction of memory addresses. An attacker could combine this bypass with another vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing:** The most common attack vector is through a malicious website. A user must visit a specially crafted webpage using an affected version of Internet Explorer, which uses the vulnerable VBScript engine.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content can also be added to compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into an existing website.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to browse to the malicious site using an affected version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for client systems and "Low" for server systems (for the security feature bypass impact).
- This vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the security update (3049563) for Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10 and 11. For earlier versions of Internet Explorer (7 and below) and systems without Internet Explorer, the vulnerability is addressed by the update described in MS15-053
- A workaround is provided which restricts access to vbscript.dll, which could affect websites that rely on VBScript.
