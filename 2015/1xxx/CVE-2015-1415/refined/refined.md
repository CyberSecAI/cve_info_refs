- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `bsdinstall(8)` installer, when configuring full disk encrypted ZFS, sets overly permissive default permissions for the GELI keyfile.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions on the GELI keyfile, which is stored at a fixed location (`/boot/encryption.key`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can obtain a copy of the GELI keyfile. This would allow the attacker to potentially decrypt the encrypted data on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker needs to be able to access the file system, typically through shell access, to read the keyfile.
