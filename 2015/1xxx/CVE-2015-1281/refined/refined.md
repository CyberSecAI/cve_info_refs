Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `core/loader/ImageLoader.cpp` file within the Blink rendering engine. Specifically, the `ImageLoader.cpp` does not properly determine the correct V8 context when processing a microtask. This leads to a situation where an image might be loaded from an unintended source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSP Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is a security mechanism designed to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks by controlling the resources a browser is allowed to load for a given website. 
*   **Context Confusion:**  Improper context handling of microtasks causes the image loader to potentially operate under the wrong security context, allowing resources to be loaded without the necessary CSP checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **CSP bypass:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious actor could inject and load malicious content (e.g. Javascript) that would normally be blocked by CSP. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Potential for other unspecified impacts:** While the primary issue is CSP bypass, the description acknowledges the possibility of other unspecified security impacts stemming from the incorrect context handling.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, leveraging the browser's ability to load resources from a remote server.
*   **Crafted Image:** The attack involves tricking the browser into loading an image from an unintended source by manipulating a V8 microtask.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker would be remote.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Image:** The attacker needs to have a website from which they can serve the malicious content.
* **Some understanding of Javascript and CSP**: The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of javascript and CSP to create a malicious microtask that triggers the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Google Chrome version 44.0.2403.89.
*   The vulnerability affects the Blink rendering engine, which is used by Chromium.
*   Several vendors such as SUSE, RedHat and openSUSE issued security patches for this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability is related to how the browser determines the V8 context of a microtask when loading images.
