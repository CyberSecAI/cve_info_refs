Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of malformed BMP, ICO, and GIF image files within the QtGui module of the Qt framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist. Specifically, the Qt framework incorrectly handles certain malformed images, leading to overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) - The application crashes due to the buffer overflow.
    - Arbitrary Code Execution - In some cases, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system by carefully crafting the malicious image file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted BMP, ICO, or GIF image files.
- A remote attacker could trick a user or automated system into opening a malicious image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted image file to a target system.
- The target system must use a vulnerable version of the QtGui library and attempt to process the malicious image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that multiple CVEs (CVE-2015-1858, CVE-2015-1859, CVE-2015-1860) are related to this issue, each potentially corresponding to a vulnerability with a specific image format.
- The vulnerable software is QtGui, which is part of the Qt framework, used for GUI elements and platform plugins.
- The Gentoo advisory recommends updating to QtGui version 4.8.6-r4 or 5.4.1-r1 or higher
- The Ubuntu security notice indicates that the vulnerability affects Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 14.10, and 15.04.
