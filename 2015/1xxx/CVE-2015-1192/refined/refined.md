  "CVE-2015-1192": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The kgb archiver is vulnerable to an absolute path traversal, allowing a remote attacker to write to arbitrary files via a crafted archive.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `kgb` archiver using absolute paths taken from a crafted archive during extraction, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directory.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Path traversal",
          "Absolute Path Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can write arbitrary files to the file system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker creates a malicious archive containing absolute paths.",
        "The user extracts the malicious archive using the vulnerable kgb tool."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious archive and have the victim extract it using the vulnerable `kgb` tool."
