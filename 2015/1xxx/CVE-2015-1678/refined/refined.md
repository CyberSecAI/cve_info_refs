The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2015-1678.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the Windows kernel-mode driver leaking private address information during a function call. This occurs due to the way the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure, where the kernel-mode driver leaks private address information that reveals the system's memory layout. This can be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms such as ASLR.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the disclosure of kernel memory contents, potentially revealing information about the system to an attacker.  It does not allow arbitrary code execution on its own but can be used to bypass security features.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable function call in the Windows kernel-mode driver, which leaks memory information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system to trigger the vulnerable driver function call.
