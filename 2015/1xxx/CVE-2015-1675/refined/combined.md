## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Journal Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

For an attack to be successful, this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Journal file with an affected version of Windows Journal. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Journal file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows Journal parses Journal files.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Do not open Windows Journal (.jnt) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**

  Do not open Windows Journal (.jnt) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* **Remove the .jnt file type association**

  **Interactive Method:**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To remove the .jnt file type association using the interactive method, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click **jntfile**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  3. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **jntfile HKCR file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.
  5. Expand **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER**, then **Software**, then **Microsoft**, then **Windows**, then **CurrentVersion**, then **Explorer**, and then **FileExts**.
  6. Click **.jnt** and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  7. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **.jntHKCU file association registry backup.reg** and then click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  8. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.

**Using a Managed Script:**

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

To remove the .jnt file type association using an interactive, managed script, follow these steps:

1. First make a backup copy of the registry keys using a managed deployment script with the following commands:

   ```
   ```
   Regedit.exe /e jntfile_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jntfile
   Regedit.exe /e jnt_HKCU_registry_backup.reg `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jnt
   ```

   ```
2. Next save the following to a file with a .reg extension (e.g., Delete\_jnt\_file\_association.reg):

   ```
   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jntfile]
   [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jnt]
   ```

   ```
3. Run the above registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:

   ```
   ```
   Regedit.exe /s Delete_jnt_file_association.reg
   ```

   ```

**Impact of workaround.** Double-clicking a .jnt file will no longer launch journal.exe.

**How to undo the workaround:**

Restore the registry key by using Registry Editor to restore the settings saved in the .REG files.

* **Remove Windows Journal by disabling the Windows feature that installs it**

  On Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Programs**.
  2. Click **Turn Windows Features on or off** and then clear **Tablet PC Optional Components** (Windows Vista systems) or **Tablet PC Components** (Windows 7 systems).
  3. Click **OK**.

**Impact of workaround.** Windows Journal is removed from the system.

**How to undo the workaround:**

To reinstall Windows Journal on Windows Vista or Windows 7 systems, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Programs**.
2. Click **Turn Windows Features on or off** and then check **Tablet PC Optional Components** (Windows Vista systems) or **Tablet PC Components** (Windows 7 systems).
3. Click **OK**.

* **Deny access to Journal.exe**

  To deny access to Journal.exe, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

  ```
  > takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe"
  > icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

**Impact of workaround.** Windows Journal becomes inaccessible.

**How to undo the workaround:**

To reinstate access to Journal.exe, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
> icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe" /remove:d everyone
