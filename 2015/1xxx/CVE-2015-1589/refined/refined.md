Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the `archmage` software. This arises from insufficient sanitization of file paths when unpacking CHM files, allowing an attacker to use `../` sequences to write files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory traversal: The software fails to properly validate or sanitize paths extracted from the CHM archive. This enables an attacker to specify arbitrary paths with "../" sequences during file extraction, writing files outside the intended target directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker can create or overwrite files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem, as demonstrated by creating a file in `/tmp`. This could lead to various impacts depending on the files written, including:
    - Code execution by overwriting system files.
    - Data corruption by overwriting user data.
    - Denial of service by filling up disk space or overwriting configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious CHM file: The attacker crafts a specially designed CHM file containing path entries with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). When `archmage` is used to extract this CHM file, it creates or overwrites files at the paths specified in the malicious archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious CHM file.
- Ability to make the targeted user extract the crafted CHM file using `archmage`.
- No special privileges are required for exploitation, as demonstrated by the vulnerability being triggered with a normal user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in Debian bug #776164.
- A proof of concept was provided that demonstrated writing a file to `/tmp`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `archmage` version 1:0.2.4-4.
