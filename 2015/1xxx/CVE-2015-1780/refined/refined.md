{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The oVirt's (RHEV) system allows users with MANIPULATE_STORAGE_DOMAIN permissions to attach a storage domain to any initialized data-center without proper checks on the data-center. The permission check is only made against the storage domain, not the data-center.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient permission checks. The system only verifies permissions on the storage domain being attached but fails to verify permissions on the data center, which allows for cross-datacenter storage domain attachment.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user with the `MANIPULATE_STORAGE_DOMAIN` permission can attach a storage domain to a data center they should not have access to. This could lead to a denial-of-service by attaching faulty storage domains.",
  "Attack vectors": "A user with `MANIPULATE_STORAGE_DOMAIN` permissions can attach a storage domain to any datacenter, regardless of if the user has permissions to that datacenter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have the `MANIPULATE_STORAGE_DOMAIN` permission within the oVirt/RHEV environment."
