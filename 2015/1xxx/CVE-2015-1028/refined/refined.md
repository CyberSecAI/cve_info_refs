Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the D-Link DSL-2730B modem's web interface. Specifically, several CGI scripts (`dnsProxy.cmd`, `lancfg2get.cgi`, and `wlsecrefresh.wl` & `wlsecurity.wl`) fail to adequately handle special characters, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The modem is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript or HTML code injected through vulnerable parameters is stored within the modem's configuration and executed when an administrator accesses the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code that will be executed in the browser of a user who accesses the modem's configuration interface.
- **Compromise of the modem configuration:** The injected scripts can manipulate the modem configuration, potentially redirecting traffic, creating backdoors, or disrupting network services.
- **Attacking internal network users:** Because the modem is an entry point for the internal network, exploiting this vulnerability could lead to further attacks on devices connected to the same network as the modem, as well as an exploitation of internal network users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the modem's web-based management interface.
- **Specifically vulnerable parameters:** Several parameters within the identified CGI scripts can be manipulated to inject malicious code:
    - `dnsProxy.cmd`:  `hostname`, `domainname` parameters.
    - `lancfg2get.cgi`: `brName` parameter.
    - `wlsecrefresh.wl`: `wlAuthMode`, `wl_wsc_reg`, `wl_wsc_mode` parameters.
    - `wlsecurity.wl`: `wlWpaPsk` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the modem's web interface, either through being on the same local network or, if the management interface is exposed, through the internet.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid administrative credentials to log in to the modem's interface. Default or easily guessed credentials can facilitate this.
- **Exploitation Skills:** The attacker requires the knowledge to craft specific HTTP requests with malicious payloads targeting the identified vulnerable parameters within the vulnerable CGI scripts.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to exploit the XSS vulnerability, by injecting Javascript to trigger an alert message on the user's browser. The script highlights that the attack vector could be one of four available parameters.
- The exploit scripts aim to modify parameters related to DNS proxy, LAN configuration, and wireless security.
- The XSS vulnerability also affects wireless password viewing, meaning that attackers can get their script executed when the administrator tries to view the WiFi password, by clicking on the relevant field.
