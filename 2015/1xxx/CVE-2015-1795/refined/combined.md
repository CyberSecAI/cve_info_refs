[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0484)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: glusterfs (3.8.4), redhat-storage-server (3.2.0.3). (BZ#1362373)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that glusterfs-server RPM package would write file with predictable name into world readable /tmp directory. A local attacker could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root by modifying the shell script during the installation of the glusterfs-server package. (CVE-2015-1795)

This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

Bug Fix(es):

* Bricks remain stopped if server quorum is no longer met, or if server quorum is disabled, to ensure that bricks in maintenance are not started incorrectly. (BZ#1340995)
* The metadata cache translator has been updated to improve Red Hat Gluster Storage performance when reading small files. (BZ#1427783)
* The 'gluster volume add-brick' command is no longer allowed when the replica count has increased and any replica bricks are unavailable. (BZ#1404989)
* Split-brain resolution commands work regardless of whether client-side heal or the self-heal daemon are enabled. (BZ#1403840)

Enhancement(s):

* Red Hat Gluster Storage now provides Transport Layer Security support for Samba and NFS-Ganesha. (BZ#1340608, BZ#1371475)
* A new reset-sync-time option enables resetting the sync time attribute to zero when required. (BZ#1205162)
* Tiering demotions are now triggered at most 5 seconds after a hi-watermark breach event. Administrators can use the cluster.tier-query-limit volume parameter to specify the number of records extracted from the heat database during demotion. (BZ#1361759)
* The /var/log/glusterfs/etc-glusterfs-glusterd.vol.log file is now named /var/log/glusterfs/glusterd.log. (BZ#1306120)
* The 'gluster volume attach-tier/detach-tier' commands are considered deprecated in favor of the new commands, 'gluster volume tier VOLNAME attach/detach'. (BZ#1388464)
* The HA\_VOL\_SERVER parameter in the ganesha-ha.conf file is no longer used by Red Hat Gluster Storage. (BZ#1348954)
* The volfile server role can now be passed to another server when a server is unavailable. (BZ#1351949)
* Ports can now be reused when they stop being used by another service. (BZ#1263090)
* The thread pool limit for the rebalance process is now dynamic, and is determined based on the number of available cores. (BZ#1352805)
* Brick verification at reboot now uses UUID instead of brick path. (BZ#1336267)
* LOGIN\_NAME\_MAX is now used as the maximum length for the slave user instead of \_\_POSIX\_LOGIN\_NAME\_MAX, allowing for up to 256 characters including the NULL byte. (BZ#1400365)
* The client identifier is now included in the log message to make it easier to determine which client failed to connect. (BZ#1333885)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-11 16:37:19 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the glusterfs.spec file writes a shell script under a predictable temporary name. A local attacker could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root by modifying the shell script during the installation of the glusterfs packages.  The vulnerable code is:  -- rpm in RHEL5 does not have os.tmpname() -- io.tmpfile() can not be resolved to a filename to pass to bash :-/ tmpname = "/tmp/glusterfs_pretrans_" .. os.date("%s") tmpfile = io.open(tmpname, "w") tmpfile:write(script) tmpfile:close() ok, how, val = os.execute("/bin/bash " .. tmpname)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-11 16:40:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-16 19:37:22 UTC  ``` We can easily avoid this in RHEL 6/7 by using something like:  if (SomeFunc ~= nil) then   SomeFunc(Args) end  and then for RHEL 5 we can use a made up /tmp thing that is a bit safer like maybe math.random or read from /dev/random and create a string from that.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-17 17:07:32 UTC  ``` This only affects Gluster packages built with the -server sub package.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c4)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-07-27 15:24:52 UTC  ``` Analysis --------  Spec file of the glusterfs writes a file with a predictable name in /tmp as /tmp/glusterfs_pretrans_ as this is executed during installation or when updating the glusterfs package. An attacker can execute a targeted attack by replacing contents of glusterfs_pretrans_ file by malicious code to escalate privileges on the system.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c7)  Milind Changire    2016-09-22 11:09:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kurt Seifried from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c3)) > This only affects Gluster packages built with the -server sub package.  All %pretrans scripts, which are only available while doing a server-side RPM build, use this mechanism of writing a shell script to a temporary file and then execute it.  Would it be safe to assume that fixing all such %pretrans scripts for all glusterfs sub packages would be a sensible thing to do?  Also, the glusterfs build on rhel 5 is a client only build and the %pretrans scripts with this security issue are available only for server-side RPM builds on rhel 6 and rhel 7. Since os.tmpname() is available on rhel 6 and rhel 7, would using the file name returned by os.tmpname() fix the security issue?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-23 05:09:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 for RHEL 6   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2017:0484 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0484.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-23 05:21:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 for RHEL 7   Native Client for RHEL 7 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2017:0486 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0486.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1200927#c15)  Siddharth Sharma    2017-12-26 14:35:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of glusterfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7.   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0486)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: glusterfs (3.8.4), redhat-storage-server (3.2.0.2), vdsm (4.17.33). (BZ#1362376)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that glusterfs-server RPM package would write file with predictable name into world readable /tmp directory. A local attacker could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root by modifying the shell script during the installation of the glusterfs-server package. (CVE-2015-1795)

This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

Bug Fix(es):

* Bricks remain stopped if server quorum is no longer met, or if server quorum is disabled, to ensure that bricks in maintenance are not started incorrectly. (BZ#1340995)
* The metadata cache translator has been updated to improve Red Hat Gluster Storage performance when reading small files. (BZ#1427783)
* The 'gluster volume add-brick' command is no longer allowed when the replica count has increased and any replica bricks are unavailable. (BZ#1404989)
* Split-brain resolution commands work regardless of whether client-side heal or the self-heal daemon are enabled. (BZ#1403840)

Enhancement(s):

* Red Hat Gluster Storage now provides Transport Layer Security support for Samba and NFS-Ganesha. (BZ#1340608, BZ#1371475)
* A new reset-sync-time option enables resetting the sync time attribute to zero when required. (BZ#1205162)
* Tiering demotions are now triggered at most 5 seconds after a hi-watermark breach event. Administrators can use the cluster.tier-query-limit volume parameter to specify the number of records extracted from the heat database during demotion. (BZ#1361759)
* The /var/log/glusterfs/etc-glusterfs-glusterd.vol.log file is now named /var/log/glusterfs/glusterd.log. (BZ#1306120)
* The 'gluster volume attach-tier/detach-tier' commands are considered deprecated in favor of the new commands, 'gluster volume tier VOLNAME attach/detach'. (BZ#1388464)
* The HA\_VOL\_SERVER parameter in the ganesha-ha.conf file is no longer used by Red Hat Gluster Storage. (BZ#1348954)
* The volfile server role can now be passed to another server when a server is unavailable. (BZ#1351949)
* Ports can now be reused when they stop being used by another service. (BZ#1263090)
* The thread pool limit for the rebalance process is now dynamic, and is determined based on the number of available cores. (BZ#1352805)
* Brick verification at reboot now uses UUID instead of brick path. (BZ#1336267)
* LOGIN\_NAME\_MAX is now used as the maximum length for the slave user instead of \_\_POSIX\_LOGIN\_NAME\_MAX, allowing for up to 256 characters including the NULL byte. (BZ#1400365)
* The client identifier is now included in the log message to make it easier to determine which client failed to connect. (BZ#1333885)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1205162#c0)  Rahul Hinduja    2015-03-24 11:07:12 UTC  ``` Description of problem: =======================  If the files are deleted from slave volume after the session is deleted between master and slave volume. These files will never again sync after recreating the session. It is because we maintain the information in master for the files that are already sync.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): =============================================================  glusterfs-3.6.0.53-1.el6rhs.x86_64  How reproducible: ================= 1/1  Steps to Reproduce: ================== 1. Create and start a georep session between master and slave volume. 2. Create data to the master volume 3. Let the georep sync the data to the slave volume. 4. Once the data is synced to slave volume, stop and delete the session between master and slave. 5. Delete the files from slave volume 6. Re-create and start the session between master and slave volume. 7. The files that were deleted from slave volume doesn't get sync from master   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1205162#c2)  Aravinda VK    2015-12-08 09:27:51 UTC  ``` As part of geo-rep delete command, we should remove stime xattrs from Master Brick roots. So that on re-creation it will start syncing from beginning.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1205162#c3)  Aravinda VK    2016-04-25 07:25:45 UTC  ``` Milind, Please consider this scenario while working on stime reset patch.

Create Master and Slave cluster/volume 2. Create geo-rep session between master and slave 3. Create some data on master:  crefi -T 10 -n 10 --multi -d 5 -b 5 --random --max=5K --min=1K --f=create /mnt/master/  AND,  mkdir data; cd data ; for i in {1..999}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=dd.$i bs=1M count=1 ; done  4. Let the data be synced to slave.  5. Stop and delete the geo-rep session using reset-sync-time 6. remove the data created by crefi from slave mount 7. Append the data on master for the file in data 8. Recreate geo-rep session using force 9. Start the geo-rep session  Files do properly get sync to slave and arequal matches.  10. Stop and delete the geo-rep session again using reset-sync-time 11. remove the complete data from slave (rm -rf *) 12. Recreate geo-rep session using force 13. Start the geo-rep session  Only the root directories are synced and no subdirectory/files get sync  Master: =======  [root@dj ~]# ./scripts/arequal-checksum -p /mnt/master/  Entry counts Regular files   : 3821 Directories     : 264 Symbolic links  : 0 Other           : 0 Total           : 4085  Metadata checksums Regular files   : 489009 Directories     : 3e9 Symbolic links  : 3e9 Other           : 3e9  Checksums Regular files   : 8960ba9adedccfccf73a8f5024a4d980 Directories     : 4a40163964221b39 Symbolic links  : 0 Other           : 0 Total           : 341a23f39e5a0d75 [root@dj ~]#     Slave: ====== [root@dj ~]# ls -lR /mnt/slave/ /mnt/slave/: total 44 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:25 data drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread0 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread1 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread2 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread3 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread4 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread5 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread6 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread7 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread8 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Feb 13 22:19 thread9  /mnt/slave/data: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread0: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread1: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread2: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread3: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread4: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread5: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread6: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread7: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread8: total 0  /mnt/slave/thread9: total 0 [root@dj ~]#    Since it is not syncing.
