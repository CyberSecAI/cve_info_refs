  "CVE-2015-1795": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The glusterfs-server RPM package writes a file with a predictable name in the world-readable /tmp directory during installation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Predictable temporary file creation in a world-readable directory.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can potentially escalate their privileges to root by modifying the shell script during the installation of the glusterfs-server package.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to write to `/tmp` and modify the temporary script before it is executed."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "glusterfs.spec file writes a shell script under a predictable temporary name.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A predictable temporary name is used for a shell script that is executed by the installation process.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root by modifying the shell script during the installation of the glusterfs packages.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access.",
