{
  "CVE-2015-1232": {
    "description": "Out-of-bounds write in media.",
    "root_cause": "The `MidiManagerUsb::DispatchSendMidiData` function uses a `port_index` parameter provided by the renderer without proper validation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a crash or execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `port_index` that is out of bounds.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious renderer process that sends a crafted `port_index` to the `MidiManagerUsb::DispatchSendMidiData` function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to control a renderer process"
    ],
     "additional_information": "The fix involves validating the `port_index` against the size of the `output_streams_` vector before using it. A TODO comment was added noting that this should ideally be handled at the `MidiHost` level. This vulnerability is related to the MIDI functionality in Chromium."
