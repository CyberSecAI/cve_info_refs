## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Kaufman    2002-02-05 05:35:42 UTC  ``` The Gentoo build CD kernel image has USB support (detects USB keyboard and mouse fine), but since it initializes the USB devices in detecting them, any "Legacy support" provided by the BIOS ceases to function. The reason why is that there is either input core keyboard support or HID support in that kernel. Anyone wanting to use a USB keyboard to install Gentoo, can't.  Fix is easy, just include HID support and input core and input core keyboard support in the kernel. Then USB keyboarders should be happy. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-05 10:24:23 UTC  ``` OK, the -r15 CD includes input core keyboard and full HID support in the kernel.  It's not working for you, or is it?  Was this problem with the -r14 or -r15 iso? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Kaufman    2002-02-05 15:28:16 UTC  ``` Sorry, forgot to mention. The problem was with the -r14 ISO ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Michael Kaufman    2002-02-05 23:29:55 UTC  ``` The -r15 ISO works perfectly with USB input devices. Thanks.  ``` |  |
