Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of temporary files within the `salt/modules/serverdensity_device.py` module of SaltStack. Specifically, the module was creating and executing a downloaded shell script (`agent-install.sh`) in the `/tmp` directory, which is a world-writable directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `serverdensity_device.py` module initially used `/tmp` directly for storing and executing the downloaded `agent-install.sh` script. This is insecure because any user on the system could potentially overwrite or modify the script before execution.
*   **Lack of Unique Temporary File Creation:** Although the code uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, it does not create a temporary file in a secure directory. Instead, it uses `/tmp` which is world writable, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially replace the legitimate `agent-install.sh` script with a malicious one. When the SaltStack module executes this malicious script, the attacker could gain arbitrary code execution on the target system with the same privileges as the Salt minion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker with local access to the system (or even a less privileged user) could exploit this by placing a malicious script in the `/tmp` directory with the same name as the temporary file created by Saltstack before the SaltStack module executes it.
*   **Symlink attack:** An attacker could create a symlink to a file they control with the same name as the temporary file that Saltstack will create, and write their malicious contents to the destination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have write access to the `/tmp` directory on the target system or be able to create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file that will be created by the vulnerable module.
*   The attacker needs to be able to anticipate when the SaltStack module will execute the downloaded script or be able to trigger its execution.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix involves using `os.path.join(__opts__['cachedir'], 'tmp')` to create a temporary file within the Salt's cache directory instead of the world writable `/tmp` directory.
* The specific commit that fixes the vulnerability is: `e11298d7155e9982749483ca5538e46090caef9c`
* This issue is fixed in SaltStack version 2014.7.4.
