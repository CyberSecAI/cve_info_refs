- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view the website. Alternatively, compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content could be used to host malicious content. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the attacker-controlled content, typically by clicking a link or opening an attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host malicious web content or compromise a website and trick a user into visiting that site via a link or email attachment.
