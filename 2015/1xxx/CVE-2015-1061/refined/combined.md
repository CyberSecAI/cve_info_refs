## Designing for longevity

At Apple, we are always working to create the best experience for our customers, which is why we design products that last. Designing for longevity is a company-wide effort, informing our earliest decisions long before the first prototype is built and guided by historical customer-use data and predictions on future usage. It requires striking a balance between durability and repairability while not compromising on safety, security, and privacy.

Learn more about Apple's approach to designing for longevity, which includes access to safe and reliable repairs. [View (PDF)](/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/otherassets/programs/Longevity_by_Design.pdf)

## Beware of counterfeit parts

Some counterfeit and third party power adapters and batteries may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues. To ensure you receive a genuine Apple battery during a battery replacement, we recommend visiting an [Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/retail/) or [Apple Authorized Service Provider](https://locate.apple.com/). If you need a replacement adapter to charge your Apple device, we recommend getting an Apple power adapter.

Also non-genuine replacement displays may have compromised visual quality and may fail to work correctly. Apple-certified screen repairs are performed by trusted experts who use genuine Apple parts.

* **IOAcceleratorFamily**

  Available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, and OS X Yosemite v10.10.2

  Impact: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges

  Description: An off by one issue existed in IOAcceleratorFamily. This issue was addressed through improved bounds checking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-1066 : Ian Beer of Google Project Zero

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-1061 : Ian Beer of Google Project Zero

* **Kernel**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10.2

  Impact: Maliciously crafted or compromised applications may be able to determine addresses in the kernel

  Description: The mach\_port\_kobject kernel interface leaked kernel addresses and heap permutation value, which may aid in bypassing address space layout randomization protection. This was addressed by disabling the mach\_port\_kobject interface in production configurations.
