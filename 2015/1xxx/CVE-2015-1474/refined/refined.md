Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `native_handle_create` function in `system/core/libcutils/native_handle.c`, specifically during the calculation of the memory allocation size. The size is determined by `sizeof(native_handle_t) + sizeof(int)*(numFds + numInts)`. The `numFds` (number of file descriptors) and `numInts` (number of integers) are attacker-controlled values. If these values are sufficiently large, their sum can overflow, resulting in a smaller than required memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The primary weakness is the integer overflow in the memory allocation calculation within `native_handle_create`.
- Heap Corruption: The insufficient memory allocated by `native_handle_create` is later used by `memcpy` in `GraphicBuffer::unflatten` to copy data, leading to a heap buffer overflow and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers can potentially gain elevated privileges by corrupting the heap in critical processes like surfaceflinger or system_server.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The memory corruption can cause crashes in affected processes, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Applications: Normal applications can exploit this vulnerability.
-  Specifically, an attacker can craft a malformed `GraphicBuffer` with a large `numFds` or `numInts` values.
- SurfaceFlinger exploit: A crafted `BufferQueue` with a modified `numFDs` value is used in combination with `captureScreen` to trigger the vulnerability in `surfaceflinger`..
- System Server exploit: A malformed `GraphicBuffer` included in a Bundle sent via `setApplicationRestrictions` can trigger the vulnerability in `system_server`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code on an Android device running a vulnerable version of the OS. This can be achieved via an installed malicious application.
- The attacker needs to control the values of `numFds` and `numInts` when creating a `GraphicBuffer`.
- The attacker does not require root access to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Android versions prior to Lollipop 5.1.
- Two patches were released to fix this vulnerability, the first being incomplete.
- The vulnerability was reported by Qihoo 360.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger a crash in `surfaceflinger`.
- The backtrace of the crash clearly indicates that the memcpy operation within `libc.so` triggered a segmentation fault due to heap corruption.
- The fix involves limiting the maximum number of file descriptors and integers allowed in `native_handle_create`.
