Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **CAPWAP Daemon DTLS Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The FortiOS DTLS server is vulnerable to a DoS attack during the DTLS handshake process. Even though it implements a `HelloVerifyRequest` to prevent DoS attacks, sending multiple `ClientHello` requests in quick succession can still overwhelm the server.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of multiple initial connection requests during the DTLS handshake, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Causes a denial of service condition on the FortiOS device, locking the CAPWAP Access Controller.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a series of crafted `ClientHello` packets to the CAPWAP control daemon.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send network traffic to the FortiOS device on port 5246 (default CAPWAP control port). No specific authentication or privilege is required.

2.  **DTLS Man-In-The-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Fortinet devices use a universal "Fortinet_Factory" certificate and private key for the CAPWAP DTLS protocol, with a static certificate authority across all devices.
    *   **Weakness:** Usage of a single hardcoded certificate and private key across all Fortinet devices.
    *  **Impact:** Allows an attacker to perform MitM attacks by intercepting and decrypting the CAPWAP DTLS traffic, potentially retrieving sensitive information such as wireless SSIDs and WPA passphrases.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Harvesting the "Fortinet_Factory" certificate and private key from a Fortinet device or having prior access to this public key/certificate and then using them to intercept communication.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to obtain the universal private key and be able to intercept network traffic between a FortiGate and a wireless access point. The private key can be obtained from any Fortinet device by accessing the file system.

3.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The FortiOS administrative console does not properly sanitize inputs in CAPWAP Join requests before rendering them.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization within the administrative console when processing specific fields of the CAPWAP Join request.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the WTP Name or WTP Active Software Version fields of a CAPWAP Join request. When an administrator views this data through the FortiOS admin console, the injected script will execute.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious CAPWAP Join request containing the malicious JavaScript in the specified fields.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted CAPWAP join request to a FortiGate device. This could be achieved through a rogue access point.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the CAPWAP data protocol is cleartext by default.
*   The advisory also provides the public "Fortinet_Factory" certificate and private key.
*   There is no official solution for these issues mentioned in the advisory, and mitigations are focused on network segmentation and firewalls.

**Timeline:**

The disclosure timeline indicates that the vulnerabilities were reported to Fortinet in October 2014 and publicly disclosed in January 2015 after no official solutions were provided.

**CVE relevance:**

While this content provides detailed vulnerability information for Fortinet FortiOS, it's important to note that the CVE ID provided in the prompt (CVE-2015-1451) is a placeholder.
