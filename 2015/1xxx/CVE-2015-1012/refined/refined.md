Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the Hospira LifeCare PCA Infusion System:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Improper Authorization (CVE-2015-3459):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The communication module of the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump allows unauthenticated users to gain root privileges via Port 23/TELNET by default.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper authorization controls for accessing and managing the pump's system.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access the pump with root privileges and issue commands to modify its configuration.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote access via Port 23/TELNET.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

2.  **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CVE-2014-5406):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The pump does not properly verify the authenticity of data received, allowing unauthorized sources to upload modifications.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper verification mechanisms for data authenticity.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can remotely push unauthorized modifications to the pump, potentially affecting drug libraries and pump configuration. While modification is possible, the attacker cannot directly operate the pump remotely.
    *    **Attack Vector**:  Remote access via Port 23/TELNET, Port 80/HTTP, Port 443/HTTPS, and Port 5000/UPNP
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** High skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document provides a more detailed description of the vulnerabilities, including the specific ports involved and the potential impact.
*   The document also includes mitigation strategies such as closing unused ports, implementing layered security, isolating the pump from untrusted networks, using VPNs for remote access, checksum verifications, and implementing network segmentation with DMZs.
*   It highlights that a new version (7.0) of the system is under FDA review and it will close ports 20/FTP and 23/TELNET by default to prevent unauthorized access.
*   The provided content does not directly address CVE-2015-1012. However, CVE-2015-3459 and CVE-2014-5406 are present and relevant to the described vulnerabilities in the document.
