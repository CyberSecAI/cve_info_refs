### Bug Description

cd /var/lib/lxcfs/cgroup/freezer/user/serge/1/lxc

echo 1 > tasks

In cgmanager, the equivalent action would check for the calling uid's privilege over the target pid's uid. However lxcfs fails to do such a check. Therefore any user only needs write access to the tasks file, and then can move any pid which it can address into the cgroup owning that tasks file.

lxcfs needs to, for each pid, check that the calling uid has the privilege to move the target uid. i.e.:

\* . they are the same task

 \* . they are ownedy by the same uid

 \* . @r is root on the host, or

 \* . @v's uid is mapped into @r's where @r is root.

(copied from the function implementing this for cgmanager).

Note, cgmanager does not do this check for us because we make the cgmanager request as root on the host.

Implement privilege check when moving tasks

```
When writing pids to a tasks file in lxcfs, lxcfs was checking
for privilege over the tasks file but not over the pid being
moved.  Since the cgm_movepid request is done as root on the host,
not with the requestor's credentials, we must copy the check which
cgmanager was doing to ensure that the requesting task is allowed
to change the victim task's cgroup membership.

This is [CVE-2015-1344](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qr4r-rhfw-j9jj "CVE-2015-1344")

### Bug Description

cd /var/lib/lxcfs/cgroup/freezer/user/serge/1/lxc

echo 1 > tasks

In cgmanager, the equivalent action would check for the calling uid's privilege over the target pid's uid. However lxcfs fails to do such a check. Therefore any user only needs write access to the tasks file, and then can move any pid which it can address into the cgroup owning that tasks file.

lxcfs needs to, for each pid, check that the calling uid has the privilege to move the target uid. i.e.:

\* . they are the same task

 \* . they are ownedy by the same uid

 \* . @r is root on the host, or

 \* . @v's uid is mapped into @r's where @r is root.

(copied from the function implementing this for cgmanager).

Note, cgmanager does not do this check for us because we make the cgmanager request as root on the host.
