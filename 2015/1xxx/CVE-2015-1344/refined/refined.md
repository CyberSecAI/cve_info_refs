Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1344:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `do_write_pids` function in `lxcfs.c` in LXCFS (versions before 0.12) lacked proper privilege checks when moving processes (pids) to a new cgroup. While it checked permissions on the tasks file, it failed to verify if the user initiating the move had the necessary privileges over the process being moved.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The core issue was the missing verification of whether the calling user had the right to move the target process into the cgroup. This allowed for unauthorized manipulation of process cgroups.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user, by writing to the tasks file, could move any process they could address to a different cgroup, potentially gaining elevated control or impacting the targeted process's resources and execution. This could enable a malicious user to gain privileges they shouldn't have.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users with write access to the tasks file within an LXCFS cgroup directory.
- **Direct write to tasks file:** The attacker directly writes the pid of the target process to the tasks file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local user:** The attacker must be a user on the system where LXCFS is running.
- **Write access:** The attacker needs write permission to the tasks file located in the LXCFS virtual file system (e.g., `/var/lib/lxcfs/cgroup/freezer/user/<user>/<id>/lxc/tasks`).
- **Addressable PID:** The attacker needs to know or have access to a PID that they want to manipulate.

**Additional technical details:**

- The fix involves adding a privilege check to the `do_write_pids` function, ensuring the user moving a process has the same UID or proper root access. The logic for privilege checking is derived from how cgmanager does it.

- The vulnerability was addressed by commit [8ee2a50](https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/commit/8ee2a503e102b1a43ec4d83113dc275ab20a869a).

- Patches were created for Ubuntu Vivid, Wily and Xenial and the fix was included in `lxcfs` versions `0.10-0ubuntu2.1` and `0.7-0ubuntu4.1`.
