- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the presence of a stash file alongside copied key repository files in IBM MQ Appliance M2000, which allows access to private keys without requiring the password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  The vulnerability lies in the fact that a malicious user with read authority can access private keys from copied key repository files if the stash file is also present. 
    - Insecure handling of private keys when a stash file is present.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user with read access to key repository files can gain access to private keys without needing the password.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the attacker to have read access to the key repository files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires:
    - Read access to the key repository files.
    -  The presence of the stash file.
