Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to properly escape user input when used in SQL queries within the TYPO3 "Content Rating" (content_rating) extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the attacker being able to read sensitive information, modify data within the database, or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code through user-controllable input fields that the "Content Rating" extension uses to construct database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected web application in a manner that allows them to provide user input that is then used in a vulnerable SQL query. No special privileges or access is mentioned, implying the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerable extension is a third-party extension and not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
- The vulnerable extension is no longer available for download from the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
- The vendor failed to provide a timely security fix.
- The identified vulnerability is present in all versions 1.0.3 and below.
