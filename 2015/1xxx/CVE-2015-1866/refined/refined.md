Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A change in the implementation of the Ember.js `select` view component caused user-supplied data bound to an option's label to not be escaped correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** User-supplied data passed as the label of select options was not being escaped before being passed to the browser's innerHTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A specially crafted payload within user-supplied content bound to the `select` option label could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain.
*   This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when user-supplied data is bound to the `label` property of options within an Ember.js `select` view.
*   The `{{view "select"}}` helper was vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Data Bound to Select Options:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious data into the application that is then bound to the `label` property of options in a select view. This might involve manipulating form data, database entries, or other data sources used by the application.
*   **Application using vulnerable Ember.js version:** The application has to be using one of the affected versions, i.e. 1.10.0, 1.11.0, 1.11.1, and 1.12.0 beta.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that user-supplied values bound to the option label are escaped using `Ember.Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression`.
*   The provided code diff shows the changes in `packages/ember-htmlbars/lib/templates/select-option.hbs` and `packages/ember-views/lib/views/select.js`
*   The vulnerability was identified by Phillip Haines of Zestia.
*  The provided test cases demonstrate the vulnerability and the fix.
