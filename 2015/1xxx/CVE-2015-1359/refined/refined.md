  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Off-by-one error in the sizing of `m_EmbeddedToUnicodes`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect size allocation leading to potential buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially lead to a denial-of-service, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution if exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability lies within the PDFium library, specifically related to font handling, making PDF parsing a potential attack vector.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to craft a malicious PDF document that triggers the off-by-one error when the font is processed."

  "affected_components": [
    {
      "component": "PDFium library",
      "file": "core/src/fpdfapi/fpdf_font/fpdf_font_cid.cpp",

    "component": "Chromium",
      "details": "The vulnerability was present in Chromium before version 40.0.2214.111."
    }

    "additional_notes": "The fix involved explicitly sizing the `g_Charset` array to prevent overflows. The commit [9dd088033537c071725b9a61fd5b519d65ea9f13](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/9dd088033537c071725b9a61fd5b519d65ea9f13) addressed the issue by modifying the array declaration to include `NUMBER_OF_CIDSETS`."
