# RHSA-2015:1681 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-swift security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1681)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
deployment.

A flaw was found in openstack-swift where an authenticated user may
delete the most recent version of a versioned object regardless of
ownership. To exploit this flaw an attacker most know the name of the
object and have listing access to the x-versions-location container.
(CVE-2015-1856)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Clay Gerrard of SwiftStack as the
original reporter.

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1846)

## Topic

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Update 1, which fixes one security issue,
several bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that
provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data
storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves
availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

Red Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on
OpenStack's Object Storage (swift).

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in Red Hat Gluster Storage's
OpenStack Object Storage (swiftonfile). By adding metadata in several
separate calls, a malicious user could bypass the max\_meta\_count
constraint, and store more metadata than allowed by the configuration.
(CVE-2014-8177)

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements. Space
precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are
directed to the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Technical Notes, linked to in
the References section, for information on the most significant of these
changes.

This advisory introduces the following new features:

* Gdeploy is a tool which automates the process of creating, formatting,

and mounting bricks. When setting up a fresh cluster, gdeploy could be the
preferred choice of cluster set up, as manually executing numerous commands
can be error prone. The advantages of using gdeploy includes automated
brick creation, flexibility in choosing the drives to configure (sd, vd,
etc.), and flexibility in naming the logical volumes (LV) and volume groups
(VG). (BZ#1248899)

* The gstatus command is now fully supported. The gstatus command provides

an easy-to-use, high-level view of the health of a trusted storage pool
with a single command. It gathers information about the health of a Red Hat
Gluster Storage trusted storage pool for distributed, replicated,
distributed-replicated, dispersed, and distributed-dispersed volumes.
(BZ#1250453)

* You can now recover a bad file detected by BitRot from a replicated

volume. The information about the bad file will be logged in the scrubber
log file located at /var/log/glusterfs/scrub.log. (BZ#1238171)

* Two tailored tuned profiles are introduced to improve the performance for

specific Red Hat Gluster Storage workloads. They are: rhgs-sequential-io,
which improves performance of large files with sequential I/O workloads,
and rhgs-random-io, which improves performance of small files with random
I/O workloads (BZ# 1251360)

All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to apply this update.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

### Bug Description

The handling of object versions wrt container ACL's has been an area of interest lately and some questionable authorization behaviors have come to light:

<https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/object_version_and_ACL_use_cases>

Unfortunately I just discovered another one that actually seems damaging. Ability to destroy data without write access.

Any authenticated used can overwrite the most recent versions of any versioned object who's name is known in a container with the X-Versions-Location metadata field set if they have listing access to the x-versions-location container - regardless of their write authorization to the container. Basically if you can list an x-versions-location container you can overwrite all the current data in the source container (if you know it's name) with old copies even if you don't have write (or read) access to the source container.

Basically we're creating a preauthorized COPY from from the x-versions-location container (assuming the user has listing access to the x-versions-location container, and an old version exists) without checking to see if authenticated user has write access to the destination.

Script to reproduce the problem is attached.

Possible patch to follow.

I think we can call the authorize callback for the original DELETE request before handling the version case to ensure the request is authorized to DELETE objects in the source container.

Then call the authorize callback again for the fall-through DELETE to the x-versions-location object (which may fail independently if the user doesn't have write access to the target.

Thanks Clay for the investigation and the proposed fix!

I was able to reproduce this issue, and also to fix it with your second patch.

I'm currently writing a functional test and would like to add it afterwards if you don't mind.

good morning!

yeah of course, a unittest wouldn't be so terrible either :P

But honestly I'm more interested in just moving forward with Thiago's work [1] - I just think it'll just be harder to backport unfortunately (if we decide this is a for realzy security thing that people care about).

Yes, backporting isn't that nice, but in this case I would prefer to get this fix merged more sooner than later.

And the fix itself is only a few lines, should be ok to merge it afterwards in Thiagos patch?

I attached a functional test that basically does the same as your shell script - fails on master, passes with your fix.

Confirmed and agree this is a security concern.

Clay's patch (this one [https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1430645/+attachment/4340823/+files/more-version-auth.patch](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1430645/%2Battachment/4340823/%2Bfiles/more-version-auth.patch)) fixes for me running keystone auth and passed existing functional and unit tests so +1 from me.

As an aside, I did end up confused by subsequent functional test failures - see: <https://review.openstack.org/163385>

The discussion in <https://review.openstack.org/134347> is sort of skirting this vulnerability, just need to remain careful to keep it under wraps until we settle on a disclosure date. I recommend subscribing Thiago to this bug report so that we're all on the same page.

Assuming this is something that the Swift developers want fixed for currently supported stable branches, we'll need some sort of backports conforming to our stable branch maintenance requirements. If this ends up only being fixed in the master branch instead then we would forgo any advisory and just switch the bug to public once the determination is made.

@Alistair: yes, you're right - the reason is that each test uses the same container, but that container is not cleared between the tests and there is still one object stored after running the new test. Fixed in the attachment.

John, for bugs under embargo, we do notify stakeholders before disclosure, it's part of the vulnerability management process. Though there is no mailing list, it's a simple recipient list maintained by the VMT.

However for this bug we still need:

\* patch (for master and impacted stable branchs) to be reviewed and approved

\* impact description to be approved

\* CVE (to be requested with the approved impact description)

Then we can move on to choosing a proper disclosure date and send the advance notification.

Thanks for the info.

Yes, i know there's some other stuff to complete. But I wanted to understand what happens. I'd prefer that (once the other things have happened) we let the affected parties know, then release a couple of weeks after that so they can have time to patch.

I'm working on the other parts now.

Thanks for the info.
Yes, i know there's some other stuff to complete. But I wanted to understand what happens. I'd prefer that (once the other things have happened) we let the affected parties know, then release a couple of weeks after that so they can have time to patch.
I'm working on the other parts now.

I'm adding part of the review for the versioned write refactoring patch here to keep it private for now.

Thiago, thanks for updating the patch ( <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/134347>). I have one question: in <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/134347/25/test/functional/tests.py> line 2738 ff. we should ensure that none of the versioned objects itself is deleted (because account2 has no write permission there). So account2 might be able to delete the original object (which needs to be discussed if there is no write access to the version container), but the test needs to ensure nothing is deleted in the version container. Or am I wrong?

Yes, this is correct. I'm adding a test to make sure account2 cannot

delete a previous version of the object (i.e., directly on the versioned

container), but is able to delete the latest object from the "source"

container, because he has write access to it.

In addition, I also added a third user with no access whatsoever to test

deleting from either container.

Here is a combined (fix+tests) against master. If this patch is ok, I'll also create the necessary backport patches.

The only outstanding question I have is the unittests. The test I write counts the number of authorize calls. It fails on master and passes here, but I'm not sure if there is a better way to check the functionality instead of just a call count.

You can apply the patch with `git apply fixver.patch`

-1 for the patch attached to #18

I'm still seeing test coupling: if test\_versioning\_check\_acl fails then it leaves an object in ther versions ocntainer. SInce all tests in this class use the same ocntainers, that stray object causes test\_versioning\_dlo to fail when asserting object count in the versions container.

See attached modified patch:

I think we need a tearDown method that will clear out the containers between tests.

Also, if test\_versioning\_check\_acl assertion on ResponseError being raises fails, the second account token remains set inthe connection, causing subsequent operations to fail, including teardown. So, wrap request with a try/finally.

Added another unit test suggestion.

Can we get a properly formated patch (using git patch) in order to keep authorship and have a proper commit message embedded ?

Also the patch fails to apply on stable/icehouse. Can you post separate patchs for Icehouse and Juno too ?

Finally, can someone approve the impact description proposed in comment #11 ?

If we can get these done by the end of the week, we could have a disclosure date set to:

2015-04-08, 1500UTC

Just in time before kilo-rc... what do you think ?

I'll work on stable backports later this week.

For the description, how do we reference the versions affected? I need to check on that, too, this week. (Versioned writes were introduced in 1.5.0, but I don't know yet if the issue goes back that far.)

Now about the disclosure date: Does that give enough time for deployers to patch and deploy before it's announced?

Thanks!

For the description, by default we only reference supported stable version, assuming older version are vulnerable. Though if you can date when the bug was introduced, then it worth a mention in the affected line, e.g.:

Affects: 1.5.0 version through 2.2.2

About the disclosure date, we usually give stakeholders 3-5 business days, excluding Monday/Friday and holiday periods... When is the next version of swift supposed to be released ?

John, I think the impact description in comment #11 is accurate enough to request a CVE, we can get a more precise affected versions for the final OSSA document.

Can someone please approve it.

Prevent unauthorized delete in versioned container

An authenticated user can delete the most recent version of any

    versioned object who's name is known if the user has listing access

    to the x-versions-location container. Only Swift setups with

    allow\_version setting are affected.

This patch closes this bug, tracked as CVE-2015-1856.

Don't apply the wrong Etag validation to rebuilt fragments

Because of the object-server's interaction with ssync sender's

    X-Backend-Replication-Headers when a object (or fragment archive) is

    pushed unmodified to another node it's ETag value is duped into the

    recieving ends metadata as Etag. This interacts poorly with the

    reconstructor's RebuildingECDiskFileStream which can not know ahead of

    time the ETag of the fragment archive being rebuilt.

Don't send the Etag from the local source fragment archive being used as

    the basis for the rebuilt fragent archive's metadata along to ssync.

Check if REST API version is valid
Swift doesn't check if the used API version is valid. Currently there
is only one valid REST API version, but that might change in the
future.
This patch enforces "v1" or "v1.0" as the version string when accessing
account, containers and objects.
The list of accepted version strings can be manually overridden using a
comma-separated list in swift.conf to make this backward-compatible.
The constraint loader has been modified slightly to accept strings as
well as integers.
Any request to an account, container, and object which does not
provide the correct version string will get a 400 BadRequest response.
The allowed api versions are by default excluded from /info.

Refactor the getting roles logic in \_keystone\_identity
The list\_from\_csv in swift.common.utils is used from the composite
auth token support and this method has been used in
\_integral\_keystone\_identity. There is same logic in
\_keystone\_identity so the logic would be replaced with list\_from\_csv.

Check if device name is valid when adding to the ring
Currently device names can be empty or start and/or end with spaces.
This can create unexpected results, for example these three commands
are all valid:
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/" 1
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/sda " 1
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/ meta" 1
This patch validates device names and prevents empty names or names
starting and/or ending with spaces.
Also fixed the test "test\_warn\_at\_risk" - the test passed if the
exception was not raised.

Erasure Code Reconstructor
This patch adds the erasure code reconstructor. It follows the
design of the replicator but:
- There is no notion of update() or update\_deleted().
- There is a single job processor
- Jobs are processed partition by partition.
- At the end of processing a rebalanced or handoff partition, the
reconstructor will remove successfully reverted objects if any.
And various ssync changes such as the addition of reconstruct\_fa()
function called from ssync\_sender which performs the actual
reconstruction while sending the object to the receiver

Fix account reaper for > 3 replicas
There's a pre-existing IndexError in the pop from the container node
list in reaper's reap\_object method for object rings with a replica
count greater than the container replica count. Which is more likely
on EC storage policies.
When making the backend direct delete requests to the nodes once the
container node's list is exhausted the generic exception handler logs
the error and breaks out of any other backend object requests - but
the reaper marches forward and eventually the tombstones are
replicated.
This change just cycles the container headers across all the nodes -
which seems reasonable enough - but could certainly garner
bikeshedding.

Update container sync to use internal client
This patch changes container sync to use Internal Client instead
of Direct Client.
In the current design, container sync uses direct\_get\_object to
get the newest source object(which talks to storage node directly).
This works fine for replication storage policies however in
erasure coding policies, direct\_get\_object would only return part
of the object(it's encoded as several pieces). Using Internal
Client can get the original object in EC case.
Note that for the container sync put/delete part, it's working in
EC since it's using Simple Client.

Foundational support for PUT and GET of erasure-coded objects
This commit makes it possible to PUT an object into Swift and have it
stored using erasure coding instead of replication, and also to GET
the object back from Swift at a later time.
This works by splitting the incoming object into a number of segments,
erasure-coding each segment in turn to get fragments, then
concatenating the fragments into fragment archives. Segments are 1 MiB
in size, except the last, which is between 1 B and 1 MiB.
+====================================================================+
| object data |
+====================================================================+
|
+------------------------+----------------------+
| | |
v v v
+===================+ +===================+ +==============+
| segment 1 | | segment 2 | ... | segment N |
+===================+ +===================+ +==============+
| |
| |
v v
/=========\ /=========\
| pyeclib | | pyeclib | ...
\=========/ \=========/
| |
| |
+--> fragment A-1 +--> fragment A-2
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
+--> fragment B-1 +--> fragment B-2
| |
| |
... ...
Then, object server A gets the concatenation of fragment A-1, A-2,
..., A-N, so its .data file looks like this (called a "fragment archive"):
+=====================================================================+
| fragment A-1 | fragment A-2 | ... | fragment A-N |
+=====================================================================+
Since this means that the object server never sees the object data as
the client sent it, we have to do a few things to ensure data
integrity.
First, the proxy has to check the Etag if the client provided it; the
object server can't do it since the object server doesn't see the raw
data.
Second, if the client does not provide an Etag, the proxy computes it
and uses the MIME-PUT mechanism to provide it to the object servers
after the object body. Otherwise, the object would not have an Etag at
all.
Third, the proxy computes the MD5 of each fragment archive and sends
it to the object server using the MIME-PUT mechanism. With replicated
objects, the proxy checks that the Etags from all the object servers
match, and if they don't, returns a 500 to the client. This mitigates
the risk of data corruption in one of the proxy --> object connections,
and signals to the client when it happens. With EC objects, we can't
use that same mechanism, so we must send the checksum with each
fragment archive to get comparable protection.
On the GET path, the inverse happens: the proxy connects to a bunch of
object servers (M of them, for an M+K scheme), reads one fragment at a
time from each fragment archive, decodes those fragments into a
segment, and serves the segment to the client.
When an object server dies partway through a GET response, any
partially-fetched fragment is discarded, the resumption point is wound
back to the nearest fragment boundary, and the GET is retried with the
next object server.
GET requests for a single byterange work; GET requests for multiple
byteranges do not.
There are a number of things \_not\_ included in this commit. Some of
them are listed here:
\* multi-range GET
\* deferred cleanup of old .data files
\* durability (daemon to reconstruct missing archives)

Allow sending object metadata after data
This lets the proxy server send object metadata to the object server
after the object data. This is necessary for EC, as it allows us to
compute the etag of the object in the proxy server and still store it
with the object.
The wire format is a multipart MIME document. For sanity during a
rolling upgrade, the multipart MIME document is only sent to the
object server if it indicates, via 100 Continue header, that it knows
how to consume it.
Example 1 (new proxy, new obj server):
proxy: PUT /p/a/c/o
X-Backend-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
obj: 100 Continue
X-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
proxy: --MIMEmimeMIMEmime...
Example2: (new proxy, old obj server)
proxy: PUT /p/a/c/o
X-Backend-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
obj: 100 Continue
proxy: <obj body>

Per-policy DiskFile classes
Adds specific disk file classes for EC policy types.
The new ECDiskFile and ECDiskFileWriter classes are used by the
ECDiskFileManager.
ECDiskFileManager is registered with the DiskFileRouter for use with
EC\_POLICY type policies.
Refactors diskfile tests into BaseDiskFileMixin and BaseDiskFileManagerMixin
classes which are then extended in subclasses for the legacy
replication-type DiskFile\* and ECDiskFile\* classes.
Refactor to prefer use of a policy instance reference over a policy\_index
int to refer to a policy.
Add additional verification to DiskFileManager.get\_dev\_path to validate the
device root with common.constraints.check\_dir, even when mount\_check is
disabled for use in on a virtual swift-all-in-one.

Add support for policy types, 'erasure\_coding' policy
This patch extends the StoragePolicy class for non-replication storage
policies, the first one being "erasure coding".
Changes:
- Add 'policy\_type' support to BaseStoragePolicy class
- Disallow direct instantiation of BaseStoragePolicy class
- Subclass BaseStoragePolicy
- "StoragePolicy":
. Replication policy, default
. policy\_type = 'replication'
- "ECStoragePolicy":
. Erasure Coding policy
. policy\_type = 'erasure\_coding'
. Private member variables
ec\_type (EC backend),
ec\_num\_data\_fragments (number of fragments original
data split into after erasure coding operation),
ec\_num\_parity\_fragments (number of parity fragments
generated during erasure coding)
. Private methods
EC specific attributes and ring validator methods.
- Swift will use PyECLib, a Python Erasure Coding library, for
erasure coding operations. PyECLib is already an approved
OpenStack core requirement.
(https://bitbucket.org/kmgreen2/pyeclib/)
- Add test cases for
- 'policy\_type' StoragePolicy member
- policy\_type == 'erasure\_coding'

Set connection timeout in container sync
Container sync might get stuck without a connection timeout if the remote proxy
is not responding.
This patch sets a default timeout of 5.0 seconds for the connection attempt. The
value is much higher than other connection timeouts inside Swift (0.5); however
there might be a much higher latency to the remote peer, thus playing it safe.
There is also a retry if the attempt timed out.
Note that this setting only applies to the connection request itself. Setting
this timeout does not apply when the remote proxy goes away during a request.
Also added a short test to ensure urlopen is called with the timeout value.

Enable in-process functional test policy to be configured
Currently the in-process tests build a 2 replica, 4 partition,
2 device object ring. This patch allows an alternative policy
and ring to be specified for testing via environment variables
that may optionally be set.
SWIFT\_TEST\_IN\_PROCESS\_CONF\_DIR - This points the test setup to a
directory which may have a swift.conf file and ring file. The
test setup will then prefer these conf files over the samples
in '/etc'.
SWIFT\_TEST\_POLICY - This causes the in-process test to
use the specified policy from the swift.conf file and its
associated ring for testing (first copying the conf and ring file
and modifying device parameters to suit in-process testing). If
not set, the tests will use the default policy.
The in-process tests now start sufficient object servers for the
ring file being tested against.
This should allow in-process functional testing of various policies
and rings (e.g. EC policies) without needing to reconfigure an SAIO
for each test scenario.
The refactoring of the in\_process test setup code should also
allow easier addition of other 'hard-coded' test policies/rings
in the future.

Fix a lack of method arguments at tempauth
This fixes a kind of trivial issue with TypeError caused by a lack
of method argument at calling.
When using 'Authorization' header with tempauth, tempauth calls
\_get\_user\_groups with 3 arguments (includes self) on current code
but the method requires 4 arguments so it will go to fail with 500.
This patch fixes to take correct arguments and adds an unit test
for the case.

Tighten up recon middleware unit tests
Adds a test for get\_expirer\_info() and tightens up
the test for get\_async\_info().
While reviewing [1] I noticed that the existing tests on
master will not catch a bug creeping into the arg strings
that these methods pass to from\_recon\_cache().

Fix the prefix of messages caputured from stderr
Swift caputures both sys.stdout and sys.stderr messages and
transfers them to syslog. However, whole of the messages
uses the "STDOUT:" prefix, currently.
It will be quite confusable for debugging purpose because we
cannot make sure whether "Swift didn't caputure stderr" or
"Swift captured stderr but didn't show it" when we want to log
some stderr messages.
This patch enables to allow a new prefix "STDERR:" and use it
for sys.stderr.

Fix ContainerBroker to use policy-0 in default
Fix ContainerBroker to initialize as policy-0 on policy\_stat
table in default when storage\_policy\_index argument is NOT given.
Current ContainerBroker makes policy-1 stats in default because
the "None" value will be passed through to the last function of
db access query (i.e. a query like as "INSERT INTO policy\_stat
(storage\_policy\_index) VALUES (None)" will appear) which results
in a row "(1, 0, 0)" (the first value is the policy index) by
the PRIMARY KEY constraint on sqlite.
In worst case, container db keeps two policies, and then, ContainerBroker.get\_info
might return invalid (non-touched) policy\_stat information as container information.
(See tests in detail)
When using ContainerBroker with no storage\_policy\_index argument,
it should always act policy-0 simply.
Note that this patch doesn't affect immediately Swift behavior because
current swift ensures to use policy-0 on "Container-Server" when invalid
policy (includes None) is given. However, we should recheck also in
ContainerBroker for safety to prevent the unfortunate behavior above.

Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

If the 'add-node' is performed from the node which is HA_VOL_SERVER, the export config state is not properly copied. The reason being paswordless scp of the config files shall not work if the source and destination node are found to be same. This needs to be fixed as well in the HA script.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c5)  Soumya Koduri    2015-09-03 09:24:08 UTC  ``` Fixes are merged upstream ([bug1259225](show_bug.cgi?id=1259225 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Add node of nfs-ganesha not working on rhel7.1")).  Please note that the above mentioned 'scp' issue shall not happen if the secret.pem file is copied to all the nodes including the one where it has been generated (as already documented in RHGS3.1 admin guide). So we shall backport only the fix for 'systemctl' command path.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c9)  Soumya Koduri    2015-09-08 13:35:29 UTC  ``` As mentioned in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - Add node of nfs-ganesha not working on rhel7.1") , we do not need to backport the other fix (upstream 12091) as we have documented in RHGS 3.1 admin guide that ssh-copy-id of secret.pem file needs to be done on all the nodes including the one where it is generated.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c10)  Apeksha    2015-09-16 05:31:28 UTC  ``` Ganesha Add node works fine on rhel7.1 with glusterfs-3.7.1-15.el7rhgs.x86_64   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1259221#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-05 10:43:43 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1684)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
deployment.

A flaw was found in OpenStack Object Storage that could allow an
authenticated user to delete the most recent version of a versioned object
regardless of ownership. To exploit this flaw, an attacker must know the
name of the object and have listing access to the x-versions-location
container. (CVE-2015-1856)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Clay Gerrard of SwiftStack as the original reporter.

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1845)

## Topic

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Update 1, which fixes one security issue,
several bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that
provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data
storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves
availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

Red Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on
OpenStack's Object Storage (swift).

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in Red Hat Gluster Storage's
OpenStack Object Storage (swiftonfile). By adding metadata in several
separate calls, a malicious user could bypass the max\_meta\_count
constraint, and store more metadata than allowed by the configuration.
(CVE-2014-8177)

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements. Space
precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are
directed to the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Technical Notes, linked to in
the References section, for information on the most significant of these
changes.

This advisory introduces the following new features:

* Gdeploy is a tool which automates the process of creating, formatting,

and mounting bricks. When setting up a fresh cluster, gdeploy could be the
preferred choice of cluster set up, as manually executing numerous commands
can be error prone. The advantages of using gdeploy includes automated
brick creation, flexibility in choosing the drives to configure (sd, vd,
etc.), and flexibility in naming the logical volumes (LV) and volume groups
(VG). (BZ#1248899)

* The gstatus command is now fully supported. The gstatus command provides

an easy-to-use, high-level view of the health of a trusted storage pool
with a single command. It gathers information about the health of a Red Hat
Gluster Storage trusted storage pool for distributed, replicated,
distributed-replicated, dispersed, and distributed-dispersed volumes.
(BZ#1250453)

* You can now recover a bad file detected by BitRot from a replicated

volume. The information about the bad file will be logged in the scrubber
log file located at /var/log/glusterfs/scrub.log. (BZ#1238171)

* Two tailored tuned profiles are introduced to improve the performance for

specific Red Hat Gluster Storage workloads. They are: rhgs-sequential-io,
which improves performance of large files with sequential I/O workloads,
and rhgs-random-io, which improves performance of small files with random
I/O workloads (BZ# 1251360)

All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

on 2015-03-11

|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Fix Released | Medium | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

The handling of object versions wrt container ACL's has been an area of interest lately and some questionable authorization behaviors have come to light:

<https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/object_version_and_ACL_use_cases>

Unfortunately I just discovered another one that actually seems damaging. Ability to destroy data without write access.

Any authenticated used can overwrite the most recent versions of any versioned object who's name is known in a container with the X-Versions-Location metadata field set if they have listing access to the x-versions-location container - regardless of their write authorization to the container. Basically if you can list an x-versions-location container you can overwrite all the current data in the source container (if you know it's name) with old copies even if you don't have write (or read) access to the source container.

Basically we're creating a preauthorized COPY from from the x-versions-location container (assuming the user has listing access to the x-versions-location container, and an old version exists) without checking to see if authenticated user has write access to the destination.

Script to reproduce the problem is attached.

Possible patch to follow.

I think we can call the authorize callback for the original DELETE request before handling the version case to ensure the request is authorized to DELETE objects in the source container.

Then call the authorize callback again for the fall-through DELETE to the x-versions-location object (which may fail independently if the user doesn't have write access to the target.

Thanks Clay for the investigation and the proposed fix!

I was able to reproduce this issue, and also to fix it with your second patch.

I'm currently writing a functional test and would like to add it afterwards if you don't mind.

good morning!

yeah of course, a unittest wouldn't be so terrible either :P

But honestly I'm more interested in just moving forward with Thiago's work [1] - I just think it'll just be harder to backport unfortunately (if we decide this is a for realzy security thing that people care about).

attaching the fix to go with Thiago's change

Yes, backporting isn't that nice, but in this case I would prefer to get this fix merged more sooner than later.

And the fix itself is only a few lines, should be ok to merge it afterwards in Thiagos patch?

I attached a functional test that basically does the same as your shell script - fails on master, passes with your fix.

Confirmed and agree this is a security concern.

Clay's patch (this one [https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1430645/+attachment/4340823/+files/more-version-auth.patch](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1430645/%2Battachment/4340823/%2Bfiles/more-version-auth.patch)) fixes for me running keystone auth and passed existing functional and unit tests so +1 from me.

As an aside, I did end up confused by subsequent functional test failures - see: <https://review.openstack.org/163385>

Thanks for the report! I've added and confirmed the OSSA task.

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Unauthorized delete of versioned Swift object

Reporter: Clay Gerrard (Rackspace)

The discussion in <https://review.openstack.org/134347> is sort of skirting this vulnerability, just need to remain careful to keep it under wraps until we settle on a disclosure date. I recommend subscribing Thiago to this bug report so that we're all on the same page.

Assuming this is something that the Swift developers want fixed for currently supported stable branches, we'll need some sort of backports conforming to our stable branch maintenance requirements. If this ends up only being fixed in the master branch instead then we would forgo any advisory and just switch the bug to public once the determination is made.

Tristan Cacqueray,

I'm currently employed @ SwiftStack and we like to know how I can update the source from which you got that out-dated information.

Jeremy Stanley,

We can do that? That's a totally great idea. I totally did that.

@Christian thanks for working on a test. I applied your patch from [https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1430645/comments/5](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1430645/comments/5)

but see another test fail - must be some test coupling, perhaps you have overridden the default account in the test env?

@Christian thanks for working on a test. I applied your patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1430645/comments/5
but see another test fail - must be some test coupling, perhaps you have overridden the default account in the test env?

Clay, I pulled that info from your openstack community member profile ( <https://www.openstack.org/profile/> ).

Other than that, is the impact description accurate enough ?

Title: Unauthorized delete of versioned Swift object

Reporter: Clay Gerrard (SwiftStack)

Products: Swift

Affects: up to version 2.2.2

Description:

Clay Gerrard from SwiftStack reported a vulnerability in Swift object versioning. An authenticated user can delete the most recent version of any versioned object who's name is known if the user have listing access to the x-versions-location container. Only Swift setups with allow\_version setting are affected.

@Alistair: yes, you're right - the reason is that each test uses the same container, but that container is not cleared between the tests and there is still one object stored after running the new test. Fixed in the attachment.

Tristan, is there a mailing list for notifying deployers before this is made public?

John, for bugs under embargo, we do notify stakeholders before disclosure, it's part of the vulnerability management process. Though there is no mailing list, it's a simple recipient list maintained by the VMT.

However for this bug we still need:

\* patch (for master and impacted stable branchs) to be reviewed and approved

\* impact description to be approved

\* CVE (to be requested with the approved impact description)

Then we can move on to choosing a proper disclosure date and send the advance notification.

Thanks for the info.

Yes, i know there's some other stuff to complete. But I wanted to understand what happens. I'd prefer that (once the other things have happened) we let the affected parties know, then release a couple of weeks after that so they can have time to patch.

I'm working on the other parts now.

I'm adding part of the review for the versioned write refactoring patch here to keep it private for now.

Thiago, thanks for updating the patch ( <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/134347>). I have one question: in <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/134347/25/test/functional/tests.py> line 2738 ff. we should ensure that none of the versioned objects itself is deleted (because account2 has no write permission there). So account2 might be able to delete the original object (which needs to be discussed if there is no write access to the version container), but the test needs to ensure nothing is deleted in the version container. Or am I wrong?

Yes, this is correct. I'm adding a test to make sure account2 cannot

delete a previous version of the object (i.e., directly on the versioned

container), but is able to delete the latest object from the "source"

container, because he has write access to it.

In addition, I also added a third user with no access whatsoever to test

deleting from either container.

Here is a combined (fix+tests) against master. If this patch is ok, I'll also create the necessary backport patches.

The only outstanding question I have is the unittests. The test I write counts the number of authorize calls. It fails on master and passes here, but I'm not sure if there is a better way to check the functionality instead of just a call count.

You can apply the patch with `git apply fixver.patch`

-1 for the patch attached to #18

I'm still seeing test coupling: if test\_versioning\_check\_acl fails then it leaves an object in ther versions ocntainer. SInce all tests in this class use the same ocntainers, that stray object causes test\_versioning\_dlo to fail when asserting object count in the versions container.

See attached modified patch:

I think we need a tearDown method that will clear out the containers between tests.

Also, if test\_versioning\_check\_acl assertion on ResponseError being raises fails, the second account token remains set inthe connection, causing subsequent operations to fail, including teardown. So, wrap request with a try/finally.

Added another unit test suggestion.

Can we get a properly formated patch (using git patch) in order to keep authorship and have a proper commit message embedded ?

Also the patch fails to apply on stable/icehouse. Can you post separate patchs for Icehouse and Juno too ?

Finally, can someone approve the impact description proposed in comment #11 ?

If we can get these done by the end of the week, we could have a disclosure date set to:

2015-04-08, 1500UTC

Just in time before kilo-rc... what do you think ?

I'll work on stable backports later this week.

For the description, how do we reference the versions affected? I need to check on that, too, this week. (Versioned writes were introduced in 1.5.0, but I don't know yet if the issue goes back that far.)

Now about the disclosure date: Does that give enough time for deployers to patch and deploy before it's announced?

Thanks!

For the description, by default we only reference supported stable version, assuming older version are vulnerable. Though if you can date when the bug was introduced, then it worth a mention in the affected line, e.g.:

Affects: 1.5.0 version through 2.2.2

About the disclosure date, we usually give stakeholders 3-5 business days, excluding Monday/Friday and holiday periods... When is the next version of swift supposed to be released ?

John, I think the impact description in comment #11 is accurate enough to request a CVE, we can get a more precise affected versions for the final OSSA document.

Can someone please approve it.

Don't apply the wrong Etag validation to rebuilt fragments

Because of the object-server's interaction with ssync sender's

    X-Backend-Replication-Headers when a object (or fragment archive) is

    pushed unmodified to another node it's ETag value is duped into the

    recieving ends metadata as Etag. This interacts poorly with the

    reconstructor's RebuildingECDiskFileStream which can not know ahead of

    time the ETag of the fragment archive being rebuilt.

Don't send the Etag from the local source fragment archive being used as

    the basis for the rebuilt fragent archive's metadata along to ssync.

recieving ends metadata as Etag. This interacts poorly with the
reconstructor's RebuildingECDiskFileStream which can not know ahead of
time the ETag of the fragment archive being rebuilt.
Don't send the Etag from the local source fragment archive being used as
the basis for the rebuilt fragent archive's metadata along to ssync.

Check if REST API version is valid
Swift doesn't check if the used API version is valid. Currently there
is only one valid REST API version, but that might change in the
future.
This patch enforces "v1" or "v1.0" as the version string when accessing
account, containers and objects.
The list of accepted version strings can be manually overridden using a
comma-separated list in swift.conf to make this backward-compatible.
The constraint loader has been modified slightly to accept strings as
well as integers.
Any request to an account, container, and object which does not
provide the correct version string will get a 400 BadRequest response.
The allowed api versions are by default excluded from /info.

Check if device name is valid when adding to the ring
Currently device names can be empty or start and/or end with spaces.
This can create unexpected results, for example these three commands
are all valid:
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/" 1
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/sda " 1
swift-ring-builder account.builder add "r1z1-127.0.0.1:6000/ meta" 1
This patch validates device names and prevents empty names or names
starting and/or ending with spaces.
Also fixed the test "test\_warn\_at\_risk" - the test passed if the
exception was not raised.

Erasure Code Reconstructor
This patch adds the erasure code reconstructor. It follows the
design of the replicator but:
- There is no notion of update() or update\_deleted().
- There is a single job processor
- Jobs are processed partition by partition.
- At the end of processing a rebalanced or handoff partition, the
reconstructor will remove successfully reverted objects if any.
And various ssync changes such as the addition of reconstruct\_fa()
function called from ssync\_sender which performs the actual
reconstruction while sending the object to the receiver

Fix account reaper for > 3 replicas
There's a pre-existing IndexError in the pop from the container node
list in reaper's reap\_object method for object rings with a replica
count greater than the container replica count. Which is more likely
on EC storage policies.
When making the backend direct delete requests to the nodes once the
container node's list is exhausted the generic exception handler logs
the error and breaks out of any other backend object requests - but
the reaper marches forward and eventually the tombstones are
replicated.
This change just cycles the container headers across all the nodes -
which seems reasonable enough - but could certainly garner
bikeshedding.

Update container sync to use internal client
This patch changes container sync to use Internal Client instead
of Direct Client.
In the current design, container sync uses direct\_get\_object to
get the newest source object(which talks to storage node directly).
This works fine for replication storage policies however in
erasure coding policies, direct\_get\_object would only return part
of the object(it's encoded as several pieces). Using Internal
Client can get the original object in EC case.
Note that for the container sync put/delete part, it's working in
EC since it's using Simple Client.

Foundational support for PUT and GET of erasure-coded objects
This commit makes it possible to PUT an object into Swift and have it
stored using erasure coding instead of replication, and also to GET
the object back from Swift at a later time.
This works by splitting the incoming object into a number of segments,
erasure-coding each segment in turn to get fragments, then
concatenating the fragments into fragment archives. Segments are 1 MiB
in size, except the last, which is between 1 B and 1 MiB.
+====================================================================+
| object data |
+====================================================================+
|
+------------------------+----------------------+
| | |
v v v
+===================+ +===================+ +==============+
| segment 1 | | segment 2 | ... | segment N |
+===================+ +===================+ +==============+
| |
| |
v v
/=========\ /=========\
| pyeclib | | pyeclib | ...
\=========/ \=========/
| |
| |
+--> fragment A-1 +--> fragment A-2
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
+--> fragment B-1 +--> fragment B-2
| |
| |
... ...
Then, object server A gets the concatenation of fragment A-1, A-2,
..., A-N, so its .data file looks like this (called a "fragment archive"):
+=====================================================================+
| fragment A-1 | fragment A-2 | ... | fragment A-N |
+=====================================================================+
Since this means that the object server never sees the object data as
the client sent it, we have to do a few things to ensure data
integrity.
First, the proxy has to check the Etag if the client provided it; the
object server can't do it since the object server doesn't see the raw
data.
Second, if the client does not provide an Etag, the proxy computes it
and uses the MIME-PUT mechanism to provide it to the object servers
after the object body. Otherwise, the object would not have an Etag at
all.
Third, the proxy computes the MD5 of each fragment archive and sends
it to the object server using the MIME-PUT mechanism. With replicated
objects, the proxy checks that the Etags from all the object servers
match, and if they don't, returns a 500 to the client. This mitigates
the risk of data corruption in one of the proxy --> object connections,
and signals to the client when it happens. With EC objects, we can't
use that same mechanism, so we must send the checksum with each
fragment archive to get comparable protection.
On the GET path, the inverse happens: the proxy connects to a bunch of
object servers (M of them, for an M+K scheme), reads one fragment at a
time from each fragment archive, decodes those fragments into a
segment, and serves the segment to the client.
When an object server dies partway through a GET response, any
partially-fetched fragment is discarded, the resumption point is wound
back to the nearest fragment boundary, and the GET is retried with the
next object server.
GET requests for a single byterange work; GET requests for multiple
byteranges do not.
There are a number of things \_not\_ included in this commit. Some of
them are listed here:
\* multi-range GET
\* deferred cleanup of old .data files
\* durability (daemon to reconstruct missing archives)

Allow sending object metadata after data
This lets the proxy server send object metadata to the object server
after the object data. This is necessary for EC, as it allows us to
compute the etag of the object in the proxy server and still store it
with the object.
The wire format is a multipart MIME document. For sanity during a
rolling upgrade, the multipart MIME document is only sent to the
object server if it indicates, via 100 Continue header, that it knows
how to consume it.
Example 1 (new proxy, new obj server):
proxy: PUT /p/a/c/o
X-Backend-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
obj: 100 Continue
X-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
proxy: --MIMEmimeMIMEmime...
Example2: (new proxy, old obj server)
proxy: PUT /p/a/c/o
X-Backend-Obj-Metadata-Footer: yes
obj: 100 Continue
proxy: <obj body>

Per-policy DiskFile classes
Adds specific disk file classes for EC policy types.
The new ECDiskFile and ECDiskFileWriter classes are used by the
ECDiskFileManager.
ECDiskFileManager is registered with the DiskFileRouter for use with
EC\_POLICY type policies.
Refactors diskfile tests into BaseDiskFileMixin and BaseDiskFileManagerMixin
classes which are then extended in subclasses for the legacy
replication-type DiskFile\* and ECDiskFile\* classes.
Refactor to prefer use of a policy instance reference over a policy\_index
int to refer to a policy.
Add additional verification to DiskFileManager.get\_dev\_path to validate the
device root with common.constraints.check\_dir, even when mount\_check is
disabled for use in on a virtual swift-all-in-one.

Add support for policy types, 'erasure\_coding' policy
This patch extends the StoragePolicy class for non-replication storage
policies, the first one being "erasure coding".
Changes:
- Add 'policy\_type' support to BaseStoragePolicy class
- Disallow direct instantiation of BaseStoragePolicy class
- Subclass BaseStoragePolicy
- "StoragePolicy":
. Replication policy, default
. policy\_type = 'replication'
- "ECStoragePolicy":
. Erasure Coding policy
. policy\_type = 'erasure\_coding'
. Private member variables
ec\_type (EC backend),
ec\_num\_data\_fragments (number of fragments original
data split into after erasure coding operation),
ec\_num\_parity\_fragments (number of parity fragments
generated during erasure coding)
. Private methods
EC specific attributes and ring validator methods.
- Swift will use PyECLib, a Python Erasure Coding library, for
erasure coding operations. PyECLib is already an approved
OpenStack core requirement.
(https://bitbucket.org/kmgreen2/pyeclib/)
- Add test cases for
- 'policy\_type' StoragePolicy member
- policy\_type == 'erasure\_coding'

Set connection timeout in container sync
Container sync might get stuck without a connection timeout if the remote proxy
is not responding.
This patch sets a default timeout of 5.0 seconds for the connection attempt. The
value is much higher than other connection timeouts inside Swift (0.5); however
there might be a much higher latency to the remote peer, thus playing it safe.
There is also a retry if the attempt timed out.
Note that this setting only applies to the connection request itself. Setting
this timeout does not apply when the remote proxy goes away during a request.
Also added a short test to ensure urlopen is called with the timeout value.

Add some debug output to the ring builder
Sometimes, I get handed a builder file in a support ticket and a
question of the form "why is the balance [not] doing $thing?". When
that happens, I add a bunch of print statements to my local
swift/common/ring/builder.py, figure things out, and then delete the
print statements. This time, instead of deleting the print statements,
I turned them into debug() calls and added a "--debug" flag to the
rebalance command in hopes that someone else will find it useful.

Clarify the description of backward compatibility in Keystoneauth's docstring
If no prefix implies for the operator\_roles and/or service\_roles
parameters applies to all reseller\_prefixes in the code.
But from backward comatibility point of view, the service\_roles
parameter is newly introduced parameter so it is better to clarify
the docstring.

Fix common misspellings
Wikipedia's list of common misspellings [1] has a machine-readable
version. This patch fixes those misspellings mentioned in the list
which don't have multiple right variants (as e.g. "accension", which can
be both "accession" and "ascension"), such misspellings are left
untouched. The list of changes was manually re-checked for false
positives.

Add swift-recon feature to track swift-drive-audit error count
This is a follow-on from a previous commit which added recon info
for swift-drive-audit (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/122468/).
Here, the "--drievaudit" option is added to swift-recon tool. This
feature gives the statistics for the system-wide drive errors flagged
by swift-drive-audit. An example of the output is as follows:

Enable in-process functional test policy to be configured
Currently the in-process tests build a 2 replica, 4 partition,
2 device object ring. This patch allows an alternative policy
and ring to be specified for testing via environment variables
that may optionally be set.
SWIFT\_TEST\_IN\_PROCESS\_CONF\_DIR - This points the test setup to a
directory which may have a swift.conf file and ring file. The
test setup will then prefer these conf files over the samples
in '/etc'.
SWIFT\_TEST\_POLICY - This causes the in-process test to
use the specified policy from the swift.conf file and its
associated ring for testing (first copying the conf and ring file
and modifying device parameters to suit in-process testing). If
not set, the tests will use the default policy.
The in-process tests now start sufficient object servers for the
ring file being tested against.
This should allow in-process functional testing of various policies
and rings (e.g. EC policies) without needing to reconfigure an SAIO
for each test scenario.
The refactoring of the in\_process test setup code should also
allow easier addition of other 'hard-coded' test policies/rings
in the future.

Fix a lack of method arguments at tempauth
This fixes a kind of trivial issue with TypeError caused by a lack
of method argument at calling.
When using 'Authorization' header with tempauth, tempauth calls
\_get\_user\_groups with 3 arguments (includes self) on current code
but the method requires 4 arguments so it will go to fail with 500.
This patch fixes to take correct arguments and adds an unit test
for the case.

Fix the prefix of messages caputured from stderr
Swift caputures both sys.stdout and sys.stderr messages and
transfers them to syslog. However, whole of the messages
uses the "STDOUT:" prefix, currently.
It will be quite confusable for debugging purpose because we
cannot make sure whether "Swift didn't caputure stderr" or
"Swift captured stderr but didn't show it" when we want to log
some stderr messages.
This patch enables to allow a new prefix "STDERR:" and use it
for sys.stderr.

Fix ContainerBroker to use policy-0 in default
Fix ContainerBroker to initialize as policy-0 on policy\_stat
table in default when storage\_policy\_index argument is NOT given.
Current ContainerBroker makes policy-1 stats in default because
the "None" value will be passed through to the last function of
db access query (i.e. a query like as "INSERT INTO policy\_stat
(storage\_policy\_index) VALUES (None)" will appear) which results
in a row "(1, 0, 0)" (the first value is the policy index) by
the PRIMARY KEY constraint on sqlite.
In worst case, container db keeps two policies, and then, ContainerBroker.get\_info
might return invalid (non-touched) policy\_stat information as container information.
(See tests in detail)
When using ContainerBroker with no storage\_policy\_index argument,
it should always act policy-0 simply.
Note that this patch doesn't affect immediately Swift behavior because
current swift ensures to use policy-0 on "Container-Server" when invalid
policy (includes None) is given. However, we should recheck also in
ContainerBroker for safety to prevent the unfortunate behavior above.
