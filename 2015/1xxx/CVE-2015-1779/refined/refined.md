Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1779:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly mentions CVE-2015-1779 and describes a vulnerability in QEMU's VNC websocket handling, matching the official CVE description.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The QEMU's websocket frame decoder did not limit resources when processing incoming frames. Specifically, it didn't impose limits on the amount of memory used when reading and buffering the HTTP header data, nor when processing the frame payload, which can lead to excessive consumption of system resources by a malicious attacker.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insufficient resource limiting in VNC websockets decoder, specifically related to header processing and payload processing.
- Lack of bounds checking when receiving data.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of service (DoS) due to exhaustion of memory and CPU resources on the host running QEMU.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- A remote attacker (or malicious guest with network access) who has access to a guest's VNC console can exploit the flaw.
- Attackers could send crafted websocket frames with excessively large headers and/or payload sizes to trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have network access to the QEMU instance's VNC port, which is typically a guest vm that is configured to use VNC.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `vncws_handshake_read` function when decoding http headers and when processing websocket data in `vnc_client_read_ws` and `vncws_decode_frame` functions.
- The `g_strstr_len` function was being used inefficiently to find the end of the HTTP header, which was CPU intensive on top of the memory growth.
- The fix involves limiting the maximum size of HTTP headers to 4096 bytes, as well as processing websocket payload incrementally, limiting buffered data to 4KB for decoding purposes.
- The initial fix caused a regression, which was addressed in the second patch.
- Patches incrementally decode websocket frames and limit the size of HTTP headers.
- The issue did not affect the kvm and qemu-kvm packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.
- The issue affected Ubuntu versions 14.04 LTS, 14.10, and 15.04, as well as Fedora releases.
- Patches were released upstream, fixing the issue in QEMU.
- Red Hat issued errata for various products to address the issue.
