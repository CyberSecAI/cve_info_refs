Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly freeing an object in memory. This use-after-free condition can be exploited to achieve code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The driver frees an object, but a dangling pointer to that memory may still exist, allowing an attacker to access the freed memory.
- Improper memory handling: The root cause is the incorrect way the driver manages and frees objects in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, thereby gaining full control of the system.
- The attacker can then install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with administrative privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system locally.
- Execution of Malicious Application: The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application, or convince a logged-on user to do so.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the target system and the ability to execute code.
- The attacker needs to be able to log on locally to the system or convince a logged on user to execute a specially crafted application.
- No specific network access or remote exploitation is required for this vulnerability.
