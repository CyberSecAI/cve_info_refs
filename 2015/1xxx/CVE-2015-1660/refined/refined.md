- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer where it improperly accesses objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption that can lead to arbitrary code execution
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains full control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the site. They could also inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-accepting websites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious email attachment. The attacker does not have the ability to force a user to do this; user interaction is required.
