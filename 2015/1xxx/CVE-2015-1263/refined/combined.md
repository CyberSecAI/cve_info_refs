| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2015-05-20 11:25:34 UTC  ``` ZDI-15-236:  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Google Chrome. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within SpeechRecognitionClient.   By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.

Right now we have only CVE numbers.  I think next time it would be sufficient to have just one chromium tracker bug and not one for each CVE. I'll keep that in mind. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c4)  Forgotten User sM9JzehKpy   2015-05-22 10:51:34 UTC  ``` Hi Alexander,  Well, actually I am checking on a daily basis if a new release of Chrome stable was released. If so, I will update the chromium package. Most of the time I only have the announcement of Google available and no bug reports yet. I then build the package in its devel repo. During this build period the bug reports appear.   But it would help a lot if these bugreports are not per CVE, but just for a new Chrome release. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c5)  Andreas Stieger   2015-05-29 14:40:25 UTC  ``` released ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-05-29 15:06:28 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0969-1: An update that fixes 15 vulnerabilities is now available.

[## Chrome Releases](/.)

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/05/stable-channel-update_19.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, May 19, 2015

The Chrome team is happy to announce the promotion of Chrome 43 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 43.0.2357.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements.  A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/42.0.2311.0..43.0.2357.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M43&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[489518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489518)] CVE-2015-1265: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.3 branch (currently 4.3.61.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
