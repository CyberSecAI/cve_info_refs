    "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in j2k.c in OpenJPEG before r3002, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid JPEG2000 data in a PDF document.",

        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Improper input validation"

        "Network-based attack",
         "Crafted PDF document with malformed JPEG2000 data"
