{
  "CVE-2015-1331": {
    "Description": "lxclock.c in LXC 1.1.2 and earlier allows local users to create arbitrary files via a symlink attack on /run/lock/lxc/*.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Directory traversal flaw in LXC when creating lock files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Insufficient validation of file paths"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could exploit this flaw to create an arbitrary file as the root user. This could lead to the creation of files in unintended locations, causing denial-of-service or system instability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker sets up a symlink at `/run/lock/lxc/var/lib/lxc/<CONTAINER>` prior to an admin creating an LXC container on the system with a name matching `<CONTAINER>`. When the admin creates the container, the symlink is followed, leading to file creation at the symlink's target.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access is required to create the symlink before the LXC container is created by an administrator."
  },
    "CVE-2015-1334": {
    "Description": "attach.c in LXC 1.1.2 and earlier uses the proc filesystem in a container, which allows local container users to escape AppArmor or SELinux confinement by mounting a proc filesystem with a crafted (1) AppArmor profile or (2) SELinux label.",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "LXC incorrectly trusts the container's proc filesystem to set up AppArmor profile changes and SELinux domain transitions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect trust of container's proc filesystem",
      "AppArmor/SELinux confinement bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious container could create a fake proc filesystem and use this flaw to run programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or SELinux.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious container mounts a crafted proc filesystem, and waits for lxc-attach from the host environment. lxc-attach uses the container's /proc/PID/attr files to set up confinement, resulting in a bypass.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Local container user who can mount a proc filesystem inside the container, and an administrator to run lxc-attach from the host."
