Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/07/stable-channel-update_21.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, July 21, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 44 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 44.0.2403.89 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/43.0.2357.134..44.0.2403.89?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 44.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [43 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=Release%3D0-M44+Status%3AFixed%2CVerified&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified+Reporter&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.
