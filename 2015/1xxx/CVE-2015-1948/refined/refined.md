Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the processing of opcode 1364 within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software does not properly handle a crafted packet, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted packet over TCP port 11460.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

This advisory provides more detail than the typical CVE description, specifying the vulnerable component (opcode 1364), attack vector (TCP port 11460), and impact (remote code execution as SYSTEM).
