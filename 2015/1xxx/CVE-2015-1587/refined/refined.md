Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload functionality in the `file_to_index.php` script, which is accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary File Upload: The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or authentication.
- Lack of Authentication: The vulnerable script `file_to_index.php` can be accessed without any authentication requirements.
- Insufficient File Validation: There appears to be no validation of the file type or content during the upload process.
- Predictable File Location: The uploaded file will be saved to a predictable temporary folder (e.g., `/tmp/tmp_file_`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script (a "backdoor") to the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
- Data Breach: The attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.
- System Compromise: The attacker can compromise the entire application server and potentially other servers in the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: A malicious POST request to the vulnerable script `file_to_index.php`
- Network: The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable application over a network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- Scripting Knowledge: The attacker needs to create a malicious PHP script.
- HTTP Knowledge: The attacker needs knowledge about crafting HTTP POST requests to upload the file to the server.
- No Authentication: The attacker does not require any credentials to perform the attack.

**Additional Information:**

The exploit code provided demonstrates the vulnerability by:
1.  Setting the target URL, the upload path, and the file to upload.
2.  Crafting a multipart form data request.
3.  Uploading the malicious file via an HTTP POST request.
4.  Displaying a link where the uploaded file can be accessed.

The vulnerability affects Maarch GEC/GED versions <= 1.4 and Maarch Letterbox versions <= 2.4. The exploit is a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates how an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to upload arbitrary files and gain unauthorized access to the system.
