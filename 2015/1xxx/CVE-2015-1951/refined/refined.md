- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the potential for sensitive information being stored in a local cache and being retrievable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a failure to prevent sensitive information from being stored in a local cache and made accessible to a local attacker. The vulnerability is related to a lack of proper handling of HTTPS responses that could lead to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can obtain sensitive information from the local cache, which could potentially lead to further unauthorized access or compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the system where the sensitive information is cached.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability and access the cached data.
