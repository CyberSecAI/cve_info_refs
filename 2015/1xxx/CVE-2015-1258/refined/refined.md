```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The libvpx library, used by Google Chrome, was not built with an appropriate `--size-limit` value. This allowed a crafted VP9 video frame to specify a negative value for a size field.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  A negative size parameter vulnerability exists in the libvpx library.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially achieve other unspecified impacts.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted VP9 video frame.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker can exploit this remotely by providing a specially crafted VP9 video, likely through a website.
