# CVE-2015-1574 - Google Email App 4.2.2 remote denial of service ---

| Authors: | [Hector Marco](http://hmarco.org) & [Ismael Ripoll](http://personales.upv.es/~iripoll/) |
| --- | --- |
| CVE: | CVE-2015-1574 |
| Dates: | 19 Jan 2015 - Public disclosure |

## Description

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Receiving the email | The App. is closed |

A bug in the stock **Google email application** version 4.2.2.0200
has been found. An attacker can remotely perform an **Denial Of
Service attack** by sending a specially crafted email. No interaction from the
user is needed to produce the crash just receive the malicious email.

When the victim receives the malicious email, the application
crashes while trying to download the email. Any attempt to open again the
email application triggers a crash before the user can do anything.
The email application can not be used until the offending email is removed.

Since the application crashes immediately, to remove the malicious
email is a little bit tricky. The easiest and straightforward way to
remove it is by using other email client (or via web) from the inbox at
the email sever. Another way is by disabling the internet connexion
(Airplane mode) before launching the email reader, and then you can
remove the offending email.

Note that this is a workaround and does not prevent the attack. The
attackers can send as many emails as they want, leaving the folder where
the malicious email is present unusable until the email is removed.
## Affected Email versions

We have found the bug in email version **4.2.2.0200** running on
a **Samsung Galaxy 4 mini fully updated (19 Jan 2015)**. Newer
versions 4.2.2.0400 are not affected.
## Impact

The email application affected is the stock email application from
Google, which is present on the official versions of Android. Since the
vulnerable email version is the one used in a popular mobile, there
maybe a large number of affected users.

## The bug

The bug appears because an incorrect handling of the
**Content-Disposition** header. An incorrect Content-Disposition
header causes the crash. The malformed header which produces the crash is:

```

Content-Disposition: ;

```

According to [RFC2183](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2183.txt)
the parameters are missing. The correct header shall look like:

```

Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=genome.jpeg;

```
The source code of the Google Email Application can be found at:
[Google Email App Git repository](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Email/).
## Exploit

To successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker only needs to
send an email to the victim with an empty **Content-Disposition**
followed by a **semicolon**.

I have written a simple python script which sends the crafted email
to a target email user.

```

Email Android Google 4.2.2.0200 crasher
=======================================
Author:  Hector Marco
Website: http://hmarco.org

$ ./crash_Android_Google_email_4.2.2.0200.py -s sender@email.com -r receiver@email.com
[+] Sending crafted message to: receiver@email.com
[+] Malicious email successfully sent.

```

Exploit: [[crash\_Android\_Google\_email\_4.2.2.0200.py]](../cyber-security/exploits/crash_Android_Google_email_4.2.2.0200.py)

## FIX

The straightforward way to fix this issue is by updating the email
Android application to 4.2.2.0400 or higher. Unfortunately this is not
possible in all cases. For instance, current Samsung Galaxy 4 mini fully
updated (17 Jan 2015) is vulnerable to this attack and not higher
versions to 4.2.2.0200 are available after update the system
from "Software updates".

Non-official Android ROMs or manually updates are possible but in some
cases require root privileges in your device which in most cases causes
a loss of warranty of the device.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

It is a different source code and fix. The source code is available in:

<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Email>

Note that the HTTPParsers.cpp is the file which parses the headers but
in the Email App this is done by the MimeUtility.java.

It seems that the Chromium bug is very similar to the Email one, but I
think the attack vector is different since in the first case, it can be
exploited by sending an email and in the second case by visiting a website.

Regards,
Hector Marco.

At this point, the best available information is that this is a
vulnerability in some part of open-source software under
<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Email/>
(although we don't know the specific lines of code at fault), that
there is a security impact for a fully specified attack methodology,
and that there isn't any clear evidence that this is a duplicate of a
finding from a previous year. Use CVE-2015-1574.

This might not be a security fix. The goal of this fix might be to
ensure that other types of blank Content-Disposition headers are
considered equivalent to "Content-Disposition: inline" so that the
"treat text and images as viewables" code path is used.
