Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-1574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the Google Email application's improper handling of the `Content-Disposition` header in emails. Specifically, the application crashes when it encounters an empty `Content-Disposition` header followed by a semicolon (`;`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Header Parsing:** The application fails to correctly parse or handle a malformed `Content-Disposition` header, which leads to a crash. The application expects parameters in the header, as specified in RFC2183, but does not handle missing parameters gracefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can remotely trigger a denial-of-service condition by sending a specially crafted email.
- **Application Crash:** The email application crashes when trying to download and process the malicious email.
- **Persistent Crash:**  The application continues to crash on subsequent launches until the offending email is removed.
- **Unusable Application:** The email application becomes unusable until the malicious email is removed from the inbox via another email client (web, another app) or by disabling internet before launch to delete the email.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email:** The primary attack vector is through sending a malicious email to the victim's inbox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Email Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim's email address.
- **Crafted Email:** The attacker must craft an email with the specific malformed `Content-Disposition` header:  `Content-Disposition: ;`

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Version:** Google email application version 4.2.2.0200 is vulnerable. This version was found on a fully updated Samsung Galaxy 4 mini as of January 19, 2015.
- **Fixed Version:**  Versions 4.2.2.0400 and higher are not affected.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered automatically when the email is received, requiring no user interaction beyond receiving the email.
- **Workarounds:**
    - Access the email via another email client (or webmail interface) to delete the offending email.
    - Disable internet (airplane mode) before opening the email app, and then delete the malicious email.
- **Fix Details**:  The fix appears to be in the `MimeUtility.java` file in the Google Email App source code and involves handling empty content-disposition headers. The fix may also ensure that other types of blank Content-Disposition headers are treated as `Content-Disposition: inline`

**Exploit Details**
- A simple python script was created to send the crafted email.
- The exploit is based on the malformed header `Content-Disposition: ;`
