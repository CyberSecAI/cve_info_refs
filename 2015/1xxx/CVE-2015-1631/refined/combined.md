## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3040856)

Published: March 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL that takes them to a targeted Outlook Web App site. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to click the specially crafted URL.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Exchange Server sanitizes page content in Outlook Web App and by correcting the way Exchange validates meeting organizer authenticity when accepting, scheduling, or modifying meeting requests in Exchange calendars. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this document, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3040856](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3040856).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple OWA XSS Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Exchange Server does not properly sanitize page content in Outlook Web App. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by modifying certain properties within Outlook Web App and then convincing users to browse to the targeted Outlook Web App site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run script in the context of the current user. The script could then, for example, use the victim's identity to take actions on the affected Outlook Web App site on behalf of the victim with the same permissions as the current user. Any system that is used to access an affected version of Outlook Web App would potentially be at risk to attack. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Exchange Server sanitizes page content in Outlook Web App.

For these vulnerabilities to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted Outlook Web App site.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted Outlook Web App site and convincing the user to click the specially crafted URL.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted Outlook Web App site that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to click the specially crafted URL.

### Workarounds

* **Workaround for the OWA Modified Canary Parameter Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1628**

  Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block requests to

  ```
  <host>/owa/?ae=Item&t;=AD.RecipientType.User&id;=<id>

  ```

  where the cookie "X-OWA-Canary" contains a double quote ("), HTML markup, or JavaScript.
* **Workaround for the Exchange Error Message Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1632**

  Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block requests to

  ```
  </id></host><host>/errorfe.aspx?httpCode=500&ts;=130560784095001947&be;=DB4PR07MB0703&authError;=LiveConfigurationHRESULTException&msg;=GenericAuthErrorMessage&msgParam;=<param>

  ```

  where the query parameter "msgParam" contains a javascript URI.

## Exchange Forged Meeting Request Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1631

A spoofing vulnerability exists in Exchange Server when Exchange fails to properly validate meeting organizer identity when accepting or modifying meeting requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then use the vulnerability to schedule or modify meetings while appearing to originate from a legitimate meeting organizer. Customers using affected versions of Exchange Server are at risk for this vulnerability. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Exchange validates meeting organizer authenticity when accepting, scheduling, or modifying meeting requests in Exchange calendars.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
