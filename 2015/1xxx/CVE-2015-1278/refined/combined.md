While I like the observer patter a bit better, I think it is better to leave this responsibility to content/ as we will likely have to handle the same scenario with inner/outer WebContents as we move over to oopif. ```     | **Charlie Reis** | | On 2015/05/22 14:20:51, nasko wrote: > On 2015/05/22 13:00:50, Fady Samuel wrote: > > A ... | | --- | | 5 years, 7 months ago (2015-05-22 17:21:04 UTC) [#11](#msg11) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2015/05/22 14:20:51, nasko wrote: > On 2015/05/22 13:00:50, Fady Samuel wrote: > > A possible alternative (maybe cleaner?) approach is to do it in the > > OwnerContentsObserver in GuestViewBase: > >  > > > [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/components/guest_v...](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/components/guest_view/browser/guest_view_base.cc&q=guest_view_base.cc&sq=package:chromium&l=51) > >  > > OwnerContentsObserver::DidAttachInterstitialPage could call > > > guest_->web_contents()->GetJavaScriptDialogManager()->CancelActiveAndPendingDialogs(). > >  > > Note: Not all Guestviews have a dialog manager I think so we'd need to do a > null > > check. > >  > > I feel like the observer pattern is a little cleaner than a ForEachGuest. >  > While I like the observer patter a bit better, I think it is better to leave > this responsibility to content/ as we will likely have to handle the same > scenario with inner/outer WebContents as we move over to oopif.  I can see the benefits of both approaches.  It seems unfortunate for an outer WebContents to have to remember to tell its inner WebContents(es) about events, and an observer at the webview level could handle all the current places we call CancelActiveAndPendingDialogs (i.e., DidAttachInterstitialPage, DidNavigateAnyFrame, and RenderViewTerminated).  However, it would be very easy to forget to update the observer if we later had a bug requiring us to add another CancelActiveAndPendingDialogs call to WebContents.  In the current approach, that's handled for free (at least for dialogs).  Neither approach helps much with catching similar bugs in the future for other types of state in WebContents.  For this, I'm inclined to leave the fix in content/, since we're adding first class support for inner/outer WebContents as Nasko mentions.  Thanks for the suggestion, though! ```     | **Charlie Reis** | | Thanks for the test, wjmaclean! I've added it to this CL.

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1271, CVE-2015-1270, CVE-2015-1272, CVE-2015-1273,
CVE-2015-1274, CVE-2015-1276, CVE-2015-1277, CVE-2015-1278, CVE-2015-1279,
CVE-2015-1281, CVE-2015-1282, CVE-2015-1283, CVE-2015-1284, CVE-2015-1285,
CVE-2015-1286, CVE-2015-1287, CVE-2015-1288, CVE-2015-1289, CVE-2015-5605)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 44.0.2403.89, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.
