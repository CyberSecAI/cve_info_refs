Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1881:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2015-1881. It describes a vulnerability in OpenStack Glance's import task API where image data is not properly cleaned up after a deletion, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Glance import task doesn't correctly update the location of an image during the import process. Specifically:
    - When an image is created using the task API (import-from), the location of the image is not immediately recorded in the database.
    - If the image is deleted before the location is properly recorded, the image data remains in the backend storage as the deletion process relies on the location information.
    - This results in "untracked" image data, as Glance loses track of the location and does not initiate deletion from the backend storage, which clogs the backend storage and leading to potential DoS attacks

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Image Deletion:** The core issue is that deleting an image through the API doesn't always result in the corresponding data being removed from the backend storage.
- **Missing Location Tracking:**  The image import task fails to record the image's location in the database before activating the image, which is used in the deletion procedure.
- **Lack of Exception Handling:**  An exception is raised when an image is deleted during upload and this exception is not handled to trigger a backend cleanup of the uploaded files.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The accumulation of untracked image data leads to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, exhausting the backend storage.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker can repeatedly create and delete images via the task API, causing the backend storage to fill up with orphaned data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The uncontrolled accumulation of data can eventually lead to a DoS condition, where the Glance service becomes unusable due to a lack of storage space.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Task API Abuse:** The vulnerability is exploited using the task API's `import-from` functionality to create images.
- **Repeated Create/Delete:** The attack vector involves creating images and then deleting them before their location is properly recorded, thereby leaving untracked data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user in the OpenStack environment to make API calls to the Glance service.
- **API Access:** The attacker needs access to the Glance API, specifically the ability to use the task API to create and delete images.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves ensuring that image locations are correctly recorded during import tasks.
- It also involves ensuring that an exception during the process of saving an image triggers a backend cleanup process.
- The vulnerability is specific to the v2 Glance API.
- The vulnerability is present in OpenStack Juno (2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2) and older, and has been fixed in later versions, such as Kilo.
