| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1211300#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-04-13 14:24:10 UTC  ``` Rikus Goodell of CPanel found a race condition in coreutils (rm command). Recursive directory removal with "rm -rf" has a TOCTOU race condition when descending into subdirectories.  It uses these syscalls to traverse into subdirectories:  19935 fstatat64(4, "x", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) = 0 19935 openat(4, "x", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY) = 3  Note that the stat has NOFOLLOW, but the open does not, so if the directory "x" changes to a symlink between these two syscalls, rm will traverse across the symlink. This makes the type of attack described here possible:  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286922>  The relevant code that opens a dir in coreutils-8.4:  coreutils-8.4/lib/fts.c: 1243 #if defined FTS_WHITEOUT && 0 1244         if (ISSET(FTS_WHITEOUT)) 1245                 oflag = DTF_NODUP|DTF_REWIND; 1246         else 1247                 oflag = DTF_HIDEW|DTF_NODUP|DTF_REWIND; 1248 #else 1249 # define __opendir2(file, flag) \ 1250         ( ! ISSET(FTS_NOCHDIR) && ISSET(FTS_CWDFD) \ 1251           ? opendirat(sp->fts_cwd_fd, file)        \ 1252           : opendir(file)) 1253 #endif 1254        if ((dirp = __opendir2(cur->fts_accpath, oflag)) == NULL) {  So, it uses __opendir2 (which is defined right above); this, in turn, calls "opendirat" for a directory, which does this:  coreutils-8.4/lib/fts.c:  298 static inline DIR *  299 internal_function  300 opendirat (int fd, char const *dir)  301 {  302   int new_fd = openat (fd, dir,  303                        O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK);  O_NOFOLLOW is missing.   8.22 does stuff differently:  1316           { 1317             /* Open the directory for reading.  If this fails, we're done. 1318                If being called from fts_read, set the fts_info field. */ 1319             if ((cur->fts_dirp = fts_opendir(cur->fts_accpath, &dir_fd)) == NULL) 1320               {  fts_opendir here is:  coreutils-8.22/lib/fts.c: 1252 #define fts_opendir(file, Pdir_fd)                              \ 1253         opendirat((! ISSET(FTS_NOCHDIR) && ISSET(FTS_CWDFD)     \ 1254                    ? sp->fts_cwd_fd : AT_FDCWD),                \ 1255                   file,                                         \ 1256                   (((ISSET(FTS_PHYSICAL)                        \ 1257                      && ! (ISSET(FTS_COMFOLLOW)                 \ 1258                            && cur->fts_level == FTS_ROOTLEVEL)) \ 1259                     ?
