Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1865:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition within the `rm` command in coreutils. Specifically, this occurs during recursive directory removal (`rm -rf`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The `rm` command uses `fstatat64` with `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` to check if a path is a directory. However, it later opens the directory with `openat` *without* the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag. This creates a window where an attacker can change a directory to a symbolic link between the stat check and the open call.
- **Missing `O_NOFOLLOW` flag:** The `openat` call within `fts.c` lacks the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, which would prevent traversal of symbolic links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unintended Directory Traversal:**  An attacker can exploit this race condition to make `rm` traverse symbolic links, potentially leading to the deletion of files and directories outside the intended target. This can cause data loss or even system compromise if the attacker can link to critical system directories or files.
- **Circumventing Intended Security Checks:** The initial `fstatat64` check with `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` is meant to prevent following symlinks, but the later `openat` without `O_NOFOLLOW` bypasses this protection.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack involves creating a directory structure and then changing a directory to a symbolic link during the execution of `rm -rf`.
- This needs to happen during the small window between the `fstatat64` and `openat` calls.
- The attacker must have write permissions to the target directory and be able to create/modify symlinks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system to create and manipulate files and directories.
- The attacker must be able to time the change of directory to a symlink to coincide with the execution of the `rm -rf` command.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary commands (like `rm -rf`) which they can trigger and where they have appropriate permissions to manipulate files/directories/symlinks.

**Additional Notes**
- The bug report mentions that coreutils 8.22 handles the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag correctly during the open, making it less susceptible to the race condition, but coreutils-8.4 and possibly other versions before 8.22 are vulnerable.
-  The bug report also includes a GDB debugging example to demonstrate the exploit and how the race condition works using `openat64`
- The bug is marked as `CLOSED WONTFIX` which suggests Red Hat has decided not to fix this in the specific version of coreutils because it is either too difficult or the specific version is not in active maintenance. However, this is often mitigated by updating to a newer version of coreutils.
