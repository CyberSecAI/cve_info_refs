The provided content is related to CVE-2015-1347.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the application handles client language preferences. Specifically, the application was directly using the `$_GET['lang']` parameter to set the client language in the session without proper validation, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application was vulnerable to XSS because it was directly using user-supplied input (the `lang` parameter) in the session without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the application. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `lang` GET parameter. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a `lang` parameter containing JavaScript code. When a user clicks such crafted URL, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick users into clicking them.
- No special privileges or access to the server itself are needed to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to get a user to visit a malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**

- The commit `b38b3ca7235002137cc9ff74b3c24a4a78c9c2d1` addresses the XSS vulnerability. The fix involves checking if the provided language is valid with `Internationalization::getLanguageInfo($_GET['lang'])` before setting it in the session. This ensures that only valid language codes are stored in the session.
- The fix was included in the release v1.9.5.1.
