The GNU C Library
=================

The GNU C Library version 2.21 is now available.

The GNU C Library is used as *the* C library in the GNU system and
in GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux
as the kernel.

The GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable
and high performance C library.  It follows all relevant
standards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also
internationalized and has one of the most complete
internationalization interfaces known.

The GNU C Library webpage is at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>

Packages for the 2.21 release may be downloaded from:
        <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/>
        <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/>

The mirror list is at <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>

NEWS for version 2.21
=====================

* The following bugs are resolved with this release:

  6652, 10672, 12674, 12847, 12926, 13862, 14132, 14138, 14171, 14498,
  15215, 15378, 15884, 16009, 16418, 16191, 16469, 16576, 16617, 16618,
  16619, 16657, 16740, 16857, 17192, 17266, 17273, 17344, 17363, 17370,
  17371, 17411, 17460, 17475, 17485, 17501, 17506, 17508, 17522, 17555,
  17570, 17571, 17572, 17573, 17574, 17582, 17583, 17584, 17585, 17589,
  17594, 17601, 17608, 17616, 17625, 17630, 17633, 17634, 17635, 17647,
  17653, 17657, 17658, 17664, 17665, 17668, 17682, 17702, 17717, 17719,
  17722, 17723, 17724, 17725, 17732, 17733, 17744, 17745, 17746, 17747,
  17748, 17775, 17777, 17780, 17781, 17782, 17791, 17793, 17796, 17797,
  17801, 17803, 17806, 17834, 17844, 17848, 17868, 17869, 17870, 17885,
  17892.

* CVE-2015-1472 Under certain conditions wscanf can allocate too little
  memory for the to-be-scanned arguments and overflow the allocated
  buffer.  The implementation now correctly computes the required buffer
  size when using malloc.

* A new semaphore algorithm has been implemented in generic C code for all
  machines. Previous custom assembly implementations of semaphore were
  difficult to reason about or ensure that they were safe. The new version
  of semaphore supports machines with 64-bit or 32-bit atomic operations.
  The new semaphore algorithm is used by sem_init, sem_open, sem_post,
  sem_wait, sem_timedwait, sem_trywait, and sem_getvalue.

* Port to Altera Nios II has been contributed by Mentor Graphics.

* Optimized strcpy, stpcpy, strncpy, stpncpy, strcmp, and strncmp
  implementations for powerpc64/powerpc64le.
  Implemented by Adhemerval Zanella (IBM).

* Added support for TSX lock elision of pthread mutexes on powerpc32, powerpc64
  and powerpc64le.  This may improve lock scaling of existing programs on
  HTM capable systems.  The lock elision code is only enabled with
  --enable-lock-elision=yes.  Also, the TSX lock elision implementation for
  powerpc will issue a transaction abort on every syscall to avoid side
  effects being visible outside transactions.

* Optimized strcpy, stpcpy, strchrnul and strrchr implementations for
  AArch64.  Contributed by ARM Ltd.

* i386 memcpy functions optimized with SSE2 unaligned load/store.

* CVE-2104-7817 The wordexp function could ignore the WRDE_NOCMD flag
  under certain input conditions resulting in the execution of a shell for
  command substitution when the applicaiton did not request it. The
  implementation now checks WRDE_NOCMD immediately before executing the
  shell and returns the error WRDE_CMDSUB as expected.

* CVE-2012-3406 printf-style functions could run into a stack overflow when
  processing format strings with a large number of format specifiers.

* CVE-2014-9402 The nss_dns implementation of getnetbyname could run into an
  infinite loop if the DNS response contained a PTR record of an unexpected
  format.

* The minimum GCC version that can be used to build this version of the GNU
  C Library is GCC 4.6.  Older GCC versions, and non-GNU compilers, can
  still be used to compile programs using the GNU C Library.

* The GNU C Library is now built with -Werror by default.  This can be
  disabled by configuring with --disable-werror.

* New locales: tu_IN, bh_IN, raj_IN, ce_RU.

* The obsolete sigvec function has been removed.  This was the original
  4.2BSD interface that inspired the POSIX.1 sigaction interface, which
  programs have been using instead for about 25 years.  Of course, ABI
  compatibility for old binaries using sigvec remains intact.

* Merged gettext 0.19.3 into the intl subdirectory.  This fixes building
  with newer versions of bison.

* Support for MIPS o32 FPXX, FP64A and FP64 ABI Extensions.
  The original MIPS o32 hard-float ABI requires an FPU where double-precision
  registers overlay two consecutive single-precision registers.  MIPS32R2
  introduced a new FPU mode (FR=1) where double-precision registers extend the
  corresponding single-precision registers which is incompatible with the
  o32 hard-float ABI.  The MIPS SIMD ASE and the MIPSR6 architecture both
  require the use of FR=1 making a transition necessary.  New o32 ABI
  extensions enable users to migrate over time from the original o32 ABI
  through to the updated o32 FP64 ABI.  To achieve this the dynamic linker now
  tracks the ABI of any loaded object and verifies that new objects are
  compatible.  Mode transitions will also be requested as required and
  unsupportable objects will be rejected.  The ABI checks include both soft and
  hard float ABIs for o32, n32 and n64.

  GCC 5 with GNU binutils 2.25 onwards:
  It is strongly recommended that all o32 system libraries are built using the
  new o32 FPXX ABI (-mfpxx) to facilitate the transition as this is compatible
  with the original and all new o32 ABI extensions.  Configure a MIPS GCC
  compiler using --with-fp-32=xx to set this by default.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
According to the vendor, the following versions are affected:
* 852-303: <v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: <v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: <v1.1.5.S0

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &

Qualys Security Advisory CVE-2015-0235

GHOST: glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow

--[ Contents ]----------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Summary
2 - Analysis
3 - Mitigating factors
4 - Case studies
5 - Exploitation
6 - Acknowledgments

--[ 1 - Summary ]-------------------------------------------------------------

During a code audit performed internally at Qualys, we discovered a
buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of the GNU
C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via
the gethostbyname*() functions, so we decided to analyze it -- and its
impact -- thoroughly, and named this vulnerability "GHOST".

Our main conclusions are:

- Via gethostbyname() or gethostbyname2(), the overflowed buffer is
  located in the heap. Via gethostbyname_r() or gethostbyname2_r(), the
  overflowed buffer is caller-supplied (and may therefore be located in
  the heap, stack, .data, .bss, etc; however, we have seen no such call
  in practice).

- At most sizeof(char *) bytes can be overwritten (ie, 4 bytes on 32-bit
  machines, and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines). Bytes can be overwritten
  only with digits ('0'...'9'), dots ('.'), and a terminating null
  character ('\0').

- Despite these limitations, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
  As a proof of concept, we developed a full-fledged remote exploit
  against the Exim mail server, bypassing all existing protections
  (ASLR, PIE, and NX) on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. We will
  publish our exploit as a Metasploit module in the near future.

- The first vulnerable version of the GNU C Library is glibc-2.2,
  released on November 10, 2000.

- We identified a number of factors that mitigate the impact of this
  bug. In particular, we discovered that it was fixed on May 21, 2013
  (between the releases of glibc-2.17 and glibc-2.18). Unfortunately, it
  was not recognized as a security threat; as a result, most stable and
  long-term-support distributions were left exposed (and still are):
  Debian 7 (wheezy), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, CentOS 6 & 7,
  Ubuntu 12.04, for example.

--[ 2 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerable function, __nss_hostname_digits_dots(), is called
internally by the glibc in nss/getXXbyYY.c (the non-reentrant version)
and nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (the reentrant version). However, the calls are
surrounded by #ifdef HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS, a macro defined only in:

- inet/gethstbynm.c
- inet/gethstbynm2.c
- inet/gethstbynm_r.c
- inet/gethstbynm2_r.c
- nscd/gethstbynm3_r.c

These files implement the gethostbyname*() family, and hence the only
way to reach __nss_hostname_digits_dots() and its buffer overflow. The
purpose of this function is to avoid expensive DNS lookups if the
hostname argument is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The code below comes from glibc-2.17:

 35 int
 36 __nss_hostname_digits_dots (const char *name, struct hostent *resbuf,
 37                             char **buffer, size_t *buffer_size,
 38                             size_t buflen, struct hostent **result,
 39                             enum nss_status *status, int af, int *h_errnop)
 40 {
 ..
 57   if (isdigit (name[0]) || isxdigit (name[0]) || name[0] == ':')
 58     {
 59       const char *cp;
 60       char *hostname;
 61       typedef unsigned char host_addr_t[16];
 62       host_addr_t *host_addr;
 63       typedef char *host_addr_list_t[2];
 64       host_addr_list_t *h_addr_ptrs;
 65       char **h_alias_ptr;
 66       size_t size_needed;
 ..
 85       size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
 86                      + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
 87
 88       if (buffer_size == NULL)
 89         {
 90           if (buflen < size_needed)
 91             {
 ..
 95               goto done;
 96             }
 97         }
 98       else if (buffer_size != NULL && *buffer_size < size_needed)
 99         {
100           char *new_buf;
101           *buffer_size = size_needed;
102           new_buf = (char *) realloc (*buffer, *buffer_size);
103
104           if (new_buf == NULL)
105             {
...
114               goto done;
115             }
116           *buffer = new_buf;
117         }
...
121       host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
122       h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
123         ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
124       h_alias_ptr = (char **) ((char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs));
125       hostname = (char *) h_alias_ptr + sizeof (*h_alias_ptr);
126
127       if (isdigit (name[0]))
128         {
129           for (cp = name;; ++cp)
130             {
131               if (*cp == '\0')
132                 {
133                   int ok;
134
135                   if (*--cp == '.')
136                     break;
...
142                   if (af == AF_INET)
143                     ok = __inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) host_addr);
144                   else
145                     {
146                       assert (af == AF_INET6);
147                       ok = inet_pton (af, name, host_addr) > 0;
148                     }
149                   if (! ok)
150                     {
...
154                       goto done;
155                     }
156
157                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
...
194                   goto done;
195                 }
196
197               if (!isdigit (*cp) && *cp != '.')
198                 break;
199             }
200         }
...

Lines 85-86 compute the size_needed to store three (3) distinct entities
in buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, and name (the hostname). Lines 88-117
make sure the buffer is large enough: lines 88-97 correspond to the
reentrant case, lines 98-117 to the non-reentrant case.

Lines 121-125 prepare pointers to store four (4) distinct entities in
buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, h_alias_ptr, and hostname. The sizeof
(*h_alias_ptr) -- the size of a char pointer -- is missing from the
computation of size_needed.

The strcpy() on line 157 should therefore allow us to write past the end
of buffer, at most (depending on strlen(name) and alignment) 4 bytes on
32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. There is a similar
strcpy() after line 200, but no buffer overflow:

236           size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
237                          + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
...
267           host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
268           h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
269             ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
270           hostname = (char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs);
...
289                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);

In order to reach the overflow at line 157, the hostname argument must
meet the following requirements:

- Its first character must be a digit (line 127).

- Its last character must not be a dot (line 135).

- It must comprise only digits and dots (line 197) (we call this the
  "digits-and-dots" requirement).

- It must be long enough to overflow the buffer. For example, the
  non-reentrant gethostbyname*() functions initially allocate their
  buffer with a call to malloc(1024) (the "1-KB" requirement).

- It must be successfully parsed as an IPv4 address by inet_aton() (line
  143), or as an IPv6 address by inet_pton() (line 147). Upon careful
  analysis of these two functions, we can further refine this
  "inet-aton" requirement:

  . It is impossible to successfully parse a "digits-and-dots" hostname
    as an IPv6 address with inet_pton() (':' is forbidden). Hence it is
    impossible to reach the overflow with calls to gethostbyname2() or
    gethostbyname2_r() if the address family argument is AF_INET6.

  . Conclusion: inet_aton() is the only option, and the hostname must
    have one of the following forms: "a.b.c.d", "a.b.c", "a.b", or "a",
    where a, b, c, d must be unsigned integers, at most 0xfffffffful,
    converted successfully (ie, no integer overflow) by strtoul() in
    decimal or octal (but not hexadecimal, because 'x' and 'X' are
    forbidden).

--[ 3 - Mitigating factors ]--------------------------------------------------

The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following
reasons:

- A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
  tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:

        [BZ #15014]
        * nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (INTERNAL (REENTRANT_NAME))
        [HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS]: Set any_service when digits-dots parsing was
        successful.
        * nss/digits_dots.c (__nss_hostname_digits_dots): Remove
        redundant variable declarations and reallocation of buffer when
        parsing as IPv6 address.  Always set NSS status when called from
        reentrant functions.  Use NETDB_INTERNAL instead of TRY_AGAIN when
        buffer too small.  Correct computation of needed size.
        * nss/Makefile (tests): Add test-digits-dots.
        * nss/test-digits-dots.c: New test.

- The gethostbyname*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
  recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.

- Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
  gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet_aton()
  fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the "inet-aton"
  requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
  such programs are therefore safe.

- Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
  gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
  known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
  safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
  pre-validated by DNS software:

  . "a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
    by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets." This makes it
    impossible to satisfy the "1-KB" requirement.

  . Actually, glibc's DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
    (almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
    or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes ('\\')
    and makes it impossible to satisfy the "digits-and-dots"
    requirement.

--[ 4 - Case studies ]--------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will analyze real-world examples of programs that
call the gethostbyname*() functions, but we first introduce a small test
program that checks whether a system is vulnerable or not:

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ cat > GHOST.c << EOF
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define CANARY "in_the_coal_mine"

struct {
  char buffer[1024];
  char canary[sizeof(CANARY)];
} temp = { "buffer", CANARY };

int main(void) {
  struct hostent resbuf;
  struct hostent *result;
  int herrno;
  int retval;

  /*** strlen (name) = size_needed - sizeof (*host_addr) - sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) - 1; ***/
  size_t len = sizeof(temp.buffer) - 16*sizeof(unsigned char) - 2*sizeof(char *) - 1;
  char name[sizeof(temp.buffer)];
  memset(name, '0', len);
  name[len] = '\0';

  retval = gethostbyname_r(name, &resbuf, temp.buffer, sizeof(temp.buffer), &result, &herrno);

  if (strcmp(temp.canary, CANARY) != 0) {
    puts("vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  if (retval == ERANGE) {
    puts("not vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  puts("should not happen");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
EOF

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST

On Fedora 19 (glibc-2.17):

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ ./GHOST
vulnerable

On Fedora 20 (glibc-2.18):

[user@fedora-20 ~]$ ./GHOST
not vulnerable

----[ 4.1 - The GNU C Library ]-----------------------------------------------

The glibc itself contains a few calls to gethostbyname*() functions. In
particular, getaddrinfo() calls gethostbyname2_r() if, but only if, a
first call to inet_aton() fails: in accordance with the "inet-aton"
requirement, these internal calls are safe. For example,
eglibc-2.13/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:

      at->family = AF_UNSPEC;
      ...
      if (__inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) at->addr) != 0)
        {
          if (req->ai_family == AF_UNSPEC || req->ai_family == AF_INET)
            at->family = AF_INET;
          else if (req->ai_family == AF_INET6 && (req->ai_flags & AI_V4MAPPED))
            {
              ...
              at->family = AF_INET6;
            }
          else
            return -EAI_ADDRFAMILY;
          ...
        }
      ...
      if (at->family == AF_UNSPEC && (req->ai_flags & AI_NUMERICHOST) == 0)
        {
          ...
              size_t tmpbuflen = 512;
              char *tmpbuf = alloca (tmpbuflen);
              ...
                  rc = __gethostbyname2_r (name, family, &th, tmpbuf,
                                           tmpbuflen, &h, &herrno);
          ...
        }

----[ 4.2 - mount.nfs ]-------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, mount.nfs (a SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable:

        if (inet_aton(hostname, &addr->sin_addr))
                return 0;
        if ((hp = gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) {
                nfs_error(_("%s: can't get address for %s\n"),
                                progname, hostname);
                return -1;
        }

----[ 4.3 - mtr ]-------------------------------------------------------------

mtr (another SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable either, because it
calls getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname*() functions on any modern
(ie, IPv6-enabled) system:

#ifdef ENABLE_IPV6
  /* gethostbyname2() is deprecated so we'll use getaddrinfo() instead. */
  ...
  error = getaddrinfo( Hostname, NULL, &hints, &res );
  if ( error ) {
    if (error == EAI_SYSTEM)
       perror ("Failed to resolve host");
    else
       fprintf (stderr, "Failed to resolve host: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
    exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
  }
  ...
#else
    host = gethostbyname(Hostname);
  if (host == NULL) {
    herror("mtr gethostbyname");
    exit(1);
  }
  ...
#endif

----[ 4.4 - iputils ]---------------------------------------------------------

------[ 4.4.1 - clockdiff ]---------------------------------------------------

clockdiff is vulnerable in a straightforward manner:

        hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
        if (hp == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "clockdiff: %s: host not found\n", argv[1]);
                exit(1);
        }

------[ 4.4.2 - ping and arping ]---------------------------------------------

ping and arping call gethostbyname() and gethostbyname2(), respectively,
if and only if inet_aton() fails first. This time, however, there is
another function call in between (Fedora, for example, does define
USE_IDN):

--------[ 4.4.2.1 - ping ]----------------------------------------------------

                if (inet_aton(target, &whereto.sin_addr) == 1) {
                        ...
                } else {
                        char *idn;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                        int rc;
                        ...
                        rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);
                        if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                                fprintf(stderr, "ping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                                exit(2);
                        }
#else
                        idn = target;
#endif
                        hp = gethostbyname(idn);

--------[ 4.4.2.2 - arping ]--------------------------------------------------

        if (inet_aton(target, &dst) != 1) {
                struct hostent *hp;
                char *idn = target;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                int rc;

                rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);

                if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "arping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                        exit(2);
                }
#endif

                hp = gethostbyname2(idn, AF_INET);

--------[ 4.4.2.3 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------

If idna_to_ascii_lz() modifies the target hostname, the first call to
inet_aton() could fail and the second call (internal to gethostbyname())
could succeed. For example, idna_to_ascii_lz() transforms any Unicode
dot-like character (0x3002, 0xFF0E, 0xFF61) into an ASCII dot (".").

But it also restricts the length of a domain label to 63 characters:
this makes it impossible to reach 1024 bytes (the "1-KB" requirement)
with only 4 labels and 3 dots (the "inet-aton" requirement).

Unless inet_aton() (actually, strtoul()) can be tricked into accepting
more than 3 dots? Indeed, idna_to_ascii_lz() does not restrict the total
length of a domain name. glibc supports "thousands' grouping characters"
(man 3 printf); for example, sscanf(str, "%'lu", &ul) yields 1000 when
processing any of the following input strings:

- "1,000" in an English locale;
- "1 000" in a French locale; and
- "1.000" in a German or Spanish locale.

strtoul() implements this "number grouping" too, but its use is limited
to internal glibc functions. Conclusion: more than 3 dots is impossible,
and neither ping nor arping is vulnerable.

----[ 4.5 - procmail ]--------------------------------------------------------

procmail (a SUID-root and SGID-mail binary) is vulnerable through its
"comsat/biff" feature:

#define COMSAThost      "localhost"    /* where the biff/comsat daemon lives */
...
#define SERV_ADDRsep    '@'           /* when overriding in COMSAT=serv@addr */

int setcomsat(chp)const char*chp;
{ char*chad; ...
  chad=strchr(chp,SERV_ADDRsep);                             /* @ separator? */
  ...
  if(chad)
     *chad++='\0';                                    /* split the specifier */
  if(!chad||!*chad)                                               /* no host */
#ifndef IP_localhost                          /* Is "localhost" preresolved? */
     chad=COMSAThost;                                   /* nope, use default */
#else /* IP_localhost */
   { ...
   }
  else

   { ...
     if(!(host=gethostbyname(chad))||!host->h_0addr_list)

pppd (yet another SUID-root binary) calls gethostbyname() if a
preliminary call to inet_addr() (a simple wrapper around inet_aton())
fails. "The inet_addr() function converts the Internet host address cp
from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte
order. If the input is invalid, INADDR_NONE (usually -1) is returned.
Use of this function is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255)." A failure for inet_addr(), but a success for
inet_aton(), and consequently a path to the buffer overflow.

The Exim mail server is exploitable remotely if configured to perform

a reliable and fully-functional exploit that bypasses all existing

--[ 5 - Exploitation ]--------------------------------------------------------

----[ 5.1 - Code execution ]--------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe how we achieve remote code execution
against the Exim SMTP mail server, bypassing the NX (No-eXecute)
protection and glibc's malloc hardening.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size (we overwrite only 3 bytes of the size
field; in any case, we cannot overflow more than 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines):

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

where:

struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */

  struct malloc_chunk* fd;         /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk;

  /* Only used for large blocks: pointer to next larger size.  */
  struct malloc_chunk* fd_nextsize; /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk_nextsize;
};

and: X marks the spot where the crucial memory corruption takes place.

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk, which is managed by
glibc's malloc, overlaps another block of memory, Exim's current_block,
which is managed by Exim's internal memory allocator:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

where:

typedef struct storeblock {
  struct storeblock *next;
  size_t length;
} storeblock;

Then, we partially allocate the enlarged free chunk and overwrite the
beginning of Exim's current_block of memory (the "storeblock" structure)
with arbitrary data. In particular, we overwrite its "next" field:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaaaaa |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
                            |                         X       |
                            |<------------------------------->|
                                      allocated chunk

This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer overflow into a
write-anything-anywhere primitive, because we control both the pointer
to the next block of memory returned by Exim's allocator (the hijacked
"next" pointer) and the data allocated (a null-terminated string, the
argument of an SMTP command we send to Exim).

Finally, we use this write-anything-anywhere primitive to overwrite
Exim's run-time configuration, which is cached in the heap memory. More
precisely, we overwrite Exim's Access Control Lists (ACLs), and achieve
arbitrary command execution thanks to Exim's "${run{<command> <args>}}"
string expansion mechanism:

                                                     |< storeblock
                                                     |
-----|-------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----
 ... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----x--------------------------|---------------|x------------------|-----
          |                                           |
          '<------------------------------------------'
                      hijacked next pointer

                |< ACLs >|
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
 ... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... | old current_block | ...
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
          |      XXXXXXXX       |
          |<------------------->|
             new current_block

----[ 5.2 - Information leak ]------------------------------------------------

The success of this exploit depends on an important piece of
information: the address of Exim's run-time configuration in the heap.
In this section, we describe how we obtain this address, bypassing the
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and PIE (Position Independent
Executable) protections.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| next free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk overlaps another
block of memory, where Exim saves the error message "503 sender not yet
given\r\n" for later use:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| real free chunk | error message | ...
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

Then, we partially allocate the artificially-enlarged free chunk,
thereby splitting it in two: the newly allocated chunk, and a smaller,
free chunk (the remainder from the split). The malloc_chunk header for
this remaining free chunk overwrites the very beginning of the saved
error message with a pointer to the heap (the fd_nextsize pointer):

                            |< malloc_chunk       |< malloc_chunk
                            |                     |
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaa |p|s|f|b|F|B| r message | ...
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
                            |                     |        X         |
                            |<------------------->|<---------------->|
                                allocated chunk        free chunk

Finally, we send an invalid SMTP command to Exim, and retrieve the
fd_nextsize heap pointer from Exim's SMTP response, which includes the
corrupted error message. This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer
overflow into an information leak; moreover, it allows us to distinguish
between 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 27 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 21 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Securely connecting your small business to the outside world is as important
as connecting your internal network devices to one another. Cisco Small
Business RV Series Routers offer virtual private networking (VPN) technology
so your remote workers can connect to your network through a secure Internet
pathway."

Source: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/index.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:
<https://r.sec-consult.com/ciscoiot>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &
[1] 961
# chroot /medusa_rootfs/ bin/ash

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

<https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.23.2 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2018-20679,
CVE-2017-16544 and CVE-2019-5747.
The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - GNU C Library
* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - GNU C Library

## Details

Arnaud Le Blanc discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled file

descriptors when resolving DNS queries under high load. This may cause a

denial of service in other applications, or an information leak. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-7423](/security/CVE-2013-7423))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled receiving a

positive answer while processing the network name when performing DNS

resolution. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C

Library to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-9402](/security/CVE-2014-9402))

Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library wscanf function incorrectly

handled memory. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2015-1472](/security/CVE-2015-1472), [CVE-2015-1473](/security/CVE-2015-1473))

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

# GNU C Library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201602-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the GNU C library, the
worst allowing for remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.21-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.21-r2** |

### Background

The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library:

* The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered a stack-based buffer
  overflow in the send\_dg() and send\_vc() functions due to a buffer
  mismanagement when getaddrinfo() is called with AF\_UNSPEC
  (CVE-2015-7547).
* The strftime() function access invalid memory when passed
  out-of-range data, resulting in a crash (CVE-2015-8776).
* An integer overflow was found in the \_\_hcreate\_r() function
  (CVE-2015-8778).
* Multiple unbounded stack allocations were found in the catopen()
  function (CVE-2015-8779).

Please review the CVEs referenced below for additional vulnerabilities
that had already been fixed in previous versions of sys-libs/glibc, for
which we have not issued a GLSA before.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit any application which performs host name
resolution using getaddrinfo() in order to execute arbitrary code or
crash the application. The other vulnerabilities can possibly be
exploited to cause a Denial of Service or leak information.

### Workaround

A number of mitigating factors for CVE-2015-7547 have been identified.
Please review the upstream advisory and references below.

### Resolution

All GNU C Library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/glibc-2.21-r2"

```

It is important to ensure that no running process uses the old glibc
anymore. The easiest way to achieve that is by rebooting the machine
after updating the sys-libs/glibc package.

Note: Should you run into compilation failures while updating, please
see bug 574948.

Subject: Re: CVE request: heap buffer overflow in glibc swscanf

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> stdio-common/vfscanf.c has an ADDW macro that tries to determine

( referring to
<https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=stdio-common/vfscanf.c;hb=HEAD> )

Use CVE-2015-1472 for this issue in which an incorrect second argument
to realloc leads to a buffer overflow.

We think you mean that the integer overflow isn't reachable because,
on platforms supported by glibc, the ADDW macro wouldn't be used in a
case where "2 * wpmax" overflows. The value of wpmax is limited by the
requirement that that value was previously used in a successful
realloc call. If the realloc had failed, a "goto errout" would have
occurred.

If this is incorrect and the integer overflow actually is reachable
when operating on very long input data, then a separate CVE ID can be
assigned for the integer overflow. In any case, the integer overflow
is not within the scope of CVE-2015-1472.

Here, it seems that the goal of the policy is risk management for use
of alloca. This is security relevant for some applications that use
glibc, because it could (for example) allow a denial of service attack
that's intended to trigger a failed alloca. There was one intended
policy, and the the incorrect "__libc_use_alloca (newsize)" caused a
different (and weaker) policy to be enforced instead.

Use CVE-2015-1473 for this risk-management error.
