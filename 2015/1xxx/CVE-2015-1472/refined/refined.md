Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1472:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly mentions `CVE-2015-1472` and describes a memory allocation issue in the `wscanf` function, which matches the description of the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect size calculation when using `malloc` in the `wscanf` implementation. When allocating memory for wide character strings, it only allocates space for `newsize` bytes instead of the required `newsize * sizeof(CHAR_T)`, leading to a buffer overflow during the scanning process.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs in heap-allocated memory because of a size mismatch in memory allocation. Specifically, the allocated buffer is too small for the data being written to it during scanning of the wide strings.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some instances (e.g., glibc), it may lead to arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted inputs that cause `wscanf` to allocate an undersized buffer.
*   **Application Dependent:** The specific way this is triggered can be application specific. (e.g., Exim mail server in the provided Qualys advisory)

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to send a crafted input to an application that uses `wscanf`.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the application that uses `wscanf` and the specific format string used by the application to trigger the issue.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in glibc version 2.21 (per the glibc release notes)
*   The vulnerability affects specific versions of the GNU C Library (per the Ubuntu and Gentoo advisories).
*  The Qualys advisory highlights how this bug can be exploited via the Exim mail server, achieving code execution after a heap overflow.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-1472 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the GNU C Library's `wscanf` function, stemming from incorrect memory allocation. It can be exploited remotely to cause a denial of service and, in some cases, to execute arbitrary code, making it a critical security risk. The vulnerability can be triggered through specially crafted inputs that are processed by the vulnerable function.
