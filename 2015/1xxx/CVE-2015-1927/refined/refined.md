Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1927:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default setting of the `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.disallowServeServletsByClassname` property in IBM WebSphere Application Server. Prior to the fix, this property was set to `false` by default. This allowed applications to potentially expose servlets using the `serveServletsByClassnameEnabled` setting, which could lead to unauthorized access if not explicitly disabled by the developer. The core issue is the reliance on developers to correctly configure this setting, which is now set to `true` by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect default configuration of the `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.disallowServeServletsByClassname` property.
- Reliance on developers to properly configure security settings, which can be overlooked.
- Potential exposure of servlets through the `serveServletsByClassnameEnabled` setting if not explicitly disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker could gain elevated privileges on the system by exploiting the incorrect default configuration and accessing servlets that should not be directly accessible. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation through network access.
- Exploitation occurs if an application has `serveServletsByClassnameEnabled` set, and the server-wide property `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.disallowServeServletsByClassname` is set to `false`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server.
- No authentication is required for this exploit based on the provided information.
- The attacker needs to understand the application structure and know what servlets to try and access.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix changes the default value of `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.disallowServeServletsByClassname` from `false` to `true`.
- A workaround is to manually set the `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.disallowServeServletsByClassName` property to `true`.
- The vulnerability affects WebSphere Application Server Full Profile and Liberty Profile, versions 8.5, 8, and 7.
