- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of opcode 1332 within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A directory traversal vulnerability exists where a crafted packet sent on TCP port 11460 allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to an existing file on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted packet on TCP port 11460 to trigger the vulnerability. No authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server on TCP port 11460. No prior authentication is needed.
