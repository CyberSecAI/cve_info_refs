Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of insecure coding practices in Gecko CMS 2.3, specifically related to how user inputs are handled within the administrative panel. The identified issues include:

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to induce an authenticated admin to perform unwanted actions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of user-supplied data results in both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable SQL queries allow attackers to manipulate database operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The application lacks proper CSRF tokens, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks in admin panel, e.g. creating a new admin user.
*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores unsanitized user input (in parameters like `jak_img`, `jak_name`, and `jak_url`) within the database. When this data is later displayed, it allows for execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  Numerous parameters across different admin panel functionalities are vulnerable to reflected XSS because user inputs are not sanitized before being used within the application response.
*   **SQL Injection:** Parameters such as `jak_delete_log[]` and `ssp` are vulnerable to SQL Injection, because user input is directly used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can add new admin users.
*   **Stored XSS:** Allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the browser sessions of other admin users when they view the crafted content. This could lead to account hijacking, session theft, or further attacks.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Could be exploited to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect users to malicious websites, and perform other malicious activity in the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, modify the database content, or even gain control of the underlying database server. This could lead to full compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker would lure an authenticated admin into clicking a crafted link or visiting a page containing a malicious form to add a new admin user.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker would submit malicious JavaScript within vulnerable parameters, which is stored in database and executed when other users visit the relevant pages.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker would craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript code in vulnerable parameters. When victims visit the link, the malicious code executes.
*    **SQL Injection:** An attacker would inject malicious SQL code into parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin into interacting with malicious content.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to either inject crafted malicious code in vulnerable parameters to be stored on the server, or create a URL that will execute a reflected attack on an authenticated user's session.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to send crafted requests to the application with manipulated vulnerable parameters.

In summary, Gecko CMS 2.3 has multiple critical vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker to gain control over the application, steal sensitive information, or inject malicious content that could compromise the admin panel users.
