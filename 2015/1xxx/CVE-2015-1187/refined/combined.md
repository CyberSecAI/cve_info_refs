# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Introduction
------------
Tiago Caetano Henriques discovered a security flaw in D-link DIR-636L router
that enables an attacker on the same network to execute arbitrary commands
without being authenticated.

Vulnerable
----------
D-Link DIR-636L and possibly other versions as seen on [1].

Patches
-------
None existant at the moment.

Description
-----------
The D-Link DIR636L (possibly others) incorrectly filters input on the 'ping'
tool which allows to inject arbitrary commands into the router. Secondly,
authentication is not being  performed correctly. This enables a remote
attacker to gain full control of the router, for example to attack other
networks in a DDoS style attack, or even expose computers behind these devices
to the internet as you are able to change firewall/nat rules on this router.

Attack vector
-------------
A URL encoded POST request with the values in front of ping_addr= such as the
following, will go through and will execute the command in front of &.
POST /ping.ccp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
...
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: <http://192.168.0.1/tools_vct.asp>
Content-Length: 64
Cookie:

ccp_act=ping_v4&ping_addr=%31%39%32%2e%31%36%38%2e%30%2e%31%30%37%20%26%20%2f
%62%69%6e%2f%70%69%6e%67%20%39%34%2e%32%33%2e%37%38%2e%32%33%31

DIR-626L/DIR-636L/DIR-808L/DIR-810L/DIR-820L/DIR-826L/DIR-830L/DIR-836L - Remote code execution - Information disclosure - DNS hijacking

**Publication ID:** SAP10052

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 2 March 2015 5:09 GMT

**Last updated on:** 16 March 2015 6:37 GMT

**Overview**

D-Link was presented with a report of three potential vulnerabilities in DIR-820L by a third-party who conducted security penetration tests.   As part of D-Link’s continuing efforts of resolving security issues, D-Link expanded its investigation to DIR-626L/DIR-636L/DIR-808L/DIR-810L/DIR-826L/DIR-830L/DIR-836L.  First vulnerability reportedly relates to a malicious user who might be  be connected to the LAN-side of the device to use the devices upload utility to load malicious code without authentication.  A second vulnerability reportedly relates to the device’s ping utility that  might permit command injection without authentication.  A third vulnerability reportedly may exploit certain chipset utilities in firmware to potentially permit a malicious user an attack disclosing information about the devices configuration

Swisscom CSIRT :: CVE-2015-1187 :: [Link](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/15)  /  Packet Storm :: [Link](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/130607/swisscomdlink-ex)  Initially March 2, 2015

**Description**

A reference or a link to the original report by the third-party author is provided above.  This third-party’s report is not created by D-Link.  We encourage you to reference the third-party’s original post and contact the author if you have any questions about the vulnerability.

Please note these vulnerabilities may present potential LAN-Side or in-home risks.  The affected devices have a feature, which is default off/disabled, that allows remote administrative access. If the user turns this feature on/enabled, they may potentially put the device at risk to these attacks from the outside/internet.

In addition, some of these reported vulnerabilities require observing a LAN-Side user or tricking a user browser to gain access. To observe a user configuring the device, requires access to your home network or the use of other security exploits of other home network devices, like your personal computer, tablets, mobile phones, not related to the device.

**1) Local network; unauthenticated access**

       a) Uploading malicious code that unchecked by fwupgrade.ccp

       b) Command Injection of malicious code that is unchecked by ping.ccp

       c) Command injection of malicious code using chipset vendor included SDK utilities embedded in firmware resulting in information disclosure of device configuration

**2) Remote network; unauthenticated access**

- 1a, 1b, 1c can be used by a malicious user if end-user enabled remote configuration, which is default is disabled

**3) Remote network; 'drive-by' via CSRF.**

         - 1a, 1b, 1c attacks can be attempted if a malicious user can obtain access to the LAN-Side of the device or trick the user's browser to attack the device from the LAN-side.

**Recommendations**

Disable remote administrative access and/or verify the device’s remote administrative access feature is disabled.

Check router device history for any unauthorized access.

All devices on your network should have log-in credentials and if your network has WiFi, please make sure WiFi encryption-keys are enabled. Also for devices that cannot notify the owner of a new software updates, check for updates from the devices manufacture.

Immediately update to the fixed firmware referenced in the table below as they are made available. Please continue to monitor this page for further updates and disclourses.

D-Link recommends that your D-Link router remote network management feature be disabled (factory default is disabled) to mitigate a malicious remote user using this vulnerability to exploit your router.  If remote network management is disabled, a malicious user would require to be on the local network side of the router or have compromised another device on the network that could be used to attack the router.

D-Link recommends that all PCs (Window or Mac) be up-to-date and scanned for virus, bots, or other damaging software that could compromise the network they are connected.

WiFi encryption reduces the risk to this vulnerability if the device Web-GUI is accessed over WiFi. If WiFi network was encrypted, the malicious user would also need to compromise the WiFi encryption, or PC using the Web-GUI utility, in order to monitor the traffic and intercept the cookie.

The default configuration of D-Link's routers is to provide simple installation, ease of useability, and offer widest interoperability. D-Link Systems (D-Link US) reminds customers to configure their devices specifically to  and for security concerns within their network infrastructure. In General, D-Link Systems (D-Link US) recommends disabling services not being used, changing/securing device log-in credentials, enabling WiFi encryption, monitoring the routers log files, and access-lists for your devices so security risks for your entire network are minimized.
