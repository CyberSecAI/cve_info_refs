Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The D-Link DIR-636L router incorrectly filters input on the 'ping' tool, allowing the injection of arbitrary commands. Additionally, the authentication mechanism is flawed, enabling unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The router's ping functionality fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands.
*   **Incorrect Authentication:** The router does not properly authenticate requests to the ping functionality, allowing unauthenticated access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router.
*   **Full Control of Router:** The attacker can gain full control over the router, potentially leading to:
    *   **DDoS Attacks:** The router can be used to launch attacks on other networks.
    *   **Exposure of Internal Systems:** The attacker can modify firewall/NAT rules to expose devices behind the router to the internet.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network:** An attacker can exploit this remotely if the router's remote administrative access feature is enabled (though it's disabled by default).
*   **Local Network:** An attacker on the same network can exploit this vulnerability without authentication.
*   **CSRF:** A "drive-by" attack is possible via Cross-Site Request Forgery if the attacker can access the LAN-side of the device or trick the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router, either directly on the local network or remotely if remote administration is enabled.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication with the router if the attacker is on the local network.

**Technical Details:**
A URL-encoded POST request to `/ping.ccp` with a modified `ping_addr` parameter allows command injection. The provided example shows an injection that executes `/bin/ping` with a specified IP address:

```
POST /ping.ccp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
...
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: <http://192.168.0.1/tools_vct.asp>
Content-Length: 64
Cookie:

ccp_act=ping_v4&ping_addr=%31%39%32%2e%31%36%38%2e%30%2e%31%30%37%20%26%20%2f
%62%69%6e%2f%70%69%6e%67%20%39%34%2e%32%33%2e%37%38%2e%32%33%31
```
The `ping_addr` parameter value is URL-encoded. The decoded value `192.168.0.107 & /bin/ping 94.23.78.231` shows that  `&` is used to chain the ping command with the arbitrary command `/bin/ping 94.23.78.231`.

**Additional Notes:**
The advisory from D-Link indicates that this vulnerability affects a range of their routers including DIR-626L, DIR-636L, DIR-808L, DIR-810L, DIR-820L, DIR-826L, DIR-830L, and DIR-836L, with specific vulnerable firmware versions. Patched firmware is also provided.
