Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "file" parameter passed to scripts serving JavaScript files in Moodle. This parameter was not consistently cleaned, allowing the inclusion of directory traversal sequences like "../" or "..\" within the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to navigate outside the intended webroot directory.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The scripts did not adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "file" parameter, before using it to construct file paths.
- **Local File Disclosure:** Because an attacker can specify arbitrary paths using directory traversal, this allows them to access files located outside of the Moodle directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the web server process has access to. This can expose sensitive data like configuration files, database credentials or even source code.
- **Windows Servers Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is described as particularly critical for Windows servers due to the handling of path separators.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft a URL that includes the vulnerable script and the "file" parameter with directory traversal sequences such as "../" or "..\" to access files outside of the webroot.
- **Pre-authentication:** The exploit can be performed by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be logged in or authenticated.
- The attacker only needs to send a malicious HTTP request with the crafted "file" parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified by Moodle as MSA-15-0009.
- The issue was reported by Emiel Florijn.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Moodle versions 2.8.3, 2.7.5, and 2.6.8.
- The Moodle issue numbers associated with this vulnerability are MDL-48980 and MDL-48990.
- A workaround is suggested to prevent access to URLs containing "../" or "..\" in the web server configuration.
- The vulnerability is also aliased as CVE-2015-0246.
