- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Exchange Server not properly sanitizing page content in Outlook Web App, specifically in the Exchange Data Loss Prevention (DLP) feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the current user. This allows them to potentially take actions on the affected Outlook Web App site on behalf of the victim, with the same permissions as the current user. This could lead to unauthorized access to data or modification of settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires a user to click a specially crafted URL that leads to a targeted Outlook Web App site. This could be achieved through:
  - Email: Sending an email with a specially crafted URL.
  - Web-based attacks: Hosting a website containing the malicious URL, or compromising an existing website to host the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to click the malicious link. They don't need direct access to the Exchange server itself, but need to be able to send messages or host web content accessible to the target.
