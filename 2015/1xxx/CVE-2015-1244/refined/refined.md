Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1244:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `URLRequest::GetHSTSRedirect` function within the Chromium browser's URL request handling. This function fails to properly upgrade WebSocket (ws:) connections to secure WebSocket (wss:) connections when a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy is active for the host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HSTS Bypass: The core issue is the lack of enforcement of HSTS policy on websocket connections.
- Protocol Downgrade: Specifically, the `ws:` scheme is not being replaced by `wss:` when HSTS is active, leading to unencrypted traffic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack: A remote attacker, positioned on the network path, could intercept the unencrypted WebSocket communication.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker could then potentially eavesdrop on sensitive information exchanged through the WebSocket connection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network interception: A network attacker intercepts traffic between the client and server.
- Crafted website: The attacker could create a malicious website that forces the vulnerable browser to establish a `ws:` connection with a host that should be using `wss:`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and server.
- No specific user interaction is needed besides victim visiting the malicious website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Google Chrome versions prior to 42.0.2311.90.
- The fix involves updating the `URLRequest::GetHSTSRedirect` function to enforce HSTS on WebSocket connections, including upgrading `ws` to `wss` when a HSTS policy is present.
- The fix also updates `HttpNetworkTransaction` to treat wss: the same as https:.
- The issue is described in the Chromium issue tracker as bug 455215.
- This vulnerability affects any application using the vulnerable version of Chromium for handling network requests.
