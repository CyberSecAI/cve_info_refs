- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated web server of SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU devices allows URL redirection to untrusted sites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect (CWE-601). The web server does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary, potentially malicious websites.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect unsuspecting users to untrusted sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or the delivery of malware. The confidentiality and availability are not directly impacted. Integrity is impacted because the user is redirected to a potentially harmful website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must craft a malicious link that, when clicked, redirects the user to a website of the attacker's choosing. No special network access or authentication is needed. The attacker needs to get the user to click on a malicious link.
