The provided content is related to CVE-2015-0929 and CVE-2015-0930, not CVE-2015-1469.  It describes multiple vulnerabilities in the SerVision HVG Video Gateway web interface.

**Vulnerability 1:** (CVE-2015-0929)
*   **Root Cause:** Authentication bypass and privilege elevation due to improper access control.
*   **Weaknesses:** CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthenticated users can bypass login and gain administrative privileges by visiting the `time.htm` page, resulting in complete control over the device.
    *   Authenticated users can elevate their privileges, also via `time.htm`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing a specific URL (`time.htm`) on the web interface.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface. Unauthenticated access is possible through `time.htm`, thus no credentials are required to gain administrative access.

**Vulnerability 2:** (CVE-2015-0930)
*   **Root Cause:**  The presence of a hard-coded password.
*  **Weaknesses**: CWE-259 (Use of Hard-Coded Password).
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can log into the web interface with administrative rights using the hardcoded credentials, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attempting login with the hardcoded password on the web interface login page.
*  **Required Capabilities**: The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface, and knowledge of the hard-coded password.

**Additional details provided:**
*   The document clarifies that the authentication bypass (CVE-2015-0929) is fixed in firmware 2.2.26a78, but privilege escalation for authenticated users using time.htm was not fixed in the newest version reported (2.2.26a100).
*   The hardcoded password vulnerability (CVE-2015-0930) is addressed in firmware version 2.2.26a100.
*   The document includes CVSS metrics for the combined vulnerabilities, indicating a critical base score of 10, emphasizing the severe risk.
*   A workaround of restricting access to the web interface to only trusted hosts and networks was suggested for users unable to upgrade. However it specifically notes that the workaround does not address the privilege elevation of authenticated users via `time.htm`.
