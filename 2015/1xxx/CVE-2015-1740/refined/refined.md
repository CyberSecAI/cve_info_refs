- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This leads to memory corruption that can be exploited.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. Users would be tricked into visiting the site, typically through a link in an email or instant message, or by opening a malicious attachment, or by visiting a compromised site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or compromise a website and convince users to view the attacker-controlled content. No specific user privileges are required for initial exploitation, but it is more impactful for users with high privileges.
