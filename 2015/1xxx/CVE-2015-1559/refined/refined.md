Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in multiple administrative functions of eFront v. 3.6.15.2 (Community Edition).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist in the `administrator.php` file across different modules, including:
    - Modules: Deleting, deactivating, and activating modules.
    - Users: Deleting, deactivating, and activating users.
    - Themes: Activating, deactivating, and deleting themes.
    - Digests: Deactivating, activating, and deleting events (e.g., user registration, email activation).
    - Languages: Deactivating, activating, and deleting language settings.
- A separate CSRF vulnerability exists related to the auto-login feature, allowing an attacker to enable or disable auto-login for a user.
- The auto-login token generation mechanism uses a static salt (`cDWQR#$Rcxsc`) and the account creation date which is also fixed in default installations, making the admin's auto-login token predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform unauthorized administrative actions on the eFront platform by tricking an authenticated administrator into making malicious requests. This can lead to:
    - Deletion/deactivation of modules, users, themes, languages, and events, potentially disrupting the system functionality.
    - Enabling the auto-login feature for arbitrary user accounts, including the administrator, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
    - If auto-login is enabled, an attacker can use the predictable auto-login token to gain unauthorized access to the administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via CSRF, where an attacker crafts malicious URLs and tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting a webpage or opening an iframe containing the malicious links.
- The auto-login token predictability allows an attacker to directly log in as the admin if auto-login is enabled and default values are used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in administrator to visit a webpage or open an iframe containing the malicious links, therefore social engineering or other attack vectors are needed.
- The attacker needs to know the target URL, parameter names, and actions.
- For the auto-login vulnerability, the attacker needs knowledge of the default salt value, and the account creation date, which are fixed in default installations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor patched the vulnerabilities in version 3.6.15.3 build 18022.
- The auto-login token predictability issue is heavily tied to the CSRF vulnerability that enables attackers to turn on this feature.
- The advisory provides detailed examples of vulnerable URLs and exploit code (iframe example).
- The advisory also references other sources for more technical detail and discussion about the vulnerabilities.
