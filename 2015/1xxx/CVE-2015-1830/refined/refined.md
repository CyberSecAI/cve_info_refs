Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw within the `fileserver` web application of Apache ActiveMQ. This flaw exists in the upload/download functionality used for blob messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The core issue is a directory traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on file access.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, making it easier for attackers to leverage.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** By sending specially crafted requests, an attacker can create arbitrary files on the server with content they control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The code execution happens within the context of the user running the ActiveMQ instance.
- **Full System Compromise:**  By uploading a JSP file into the admin console, an attacker can execute shell commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `fileserver` web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ server.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any credentials or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically mentioned to affect Windows OS.
- Apache has released an update to address the issue.
- A workaround, if upgrading isn't an immediate option, is to disable the `fileserver` functionality by commenting out related lines in the `conf\jetty.xml` file.
