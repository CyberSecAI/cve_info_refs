Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the Secure Channel (Schannel) component of Microsoft Windows.
- Schannel was allowing the use of weak 512-bit Diffie-Hellman ephemeral (DHE) keys during encrypted TLS sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-  The use of 512-bit DHE keys weakens the key exchange process, making it susceptible to various attacks.
-  This is due to the insufficient length of the key, making it easier to break the encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation could lead to **information disclosure**.  Attackers might be able to eavesdrop on the encrypted communication, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack requires a server to support 512-bit DHE key lengths.
- An attacker would need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and force a TLS handshake to use a 512-bit DHE key.
- The attacker can then leverage the weak key exchange to decrypt encrypted traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
- They need to be able to manipulate the TLS handshake to negotiate the weak 512-bit DHE key.
- The attacker also needs to have the computational power to perform the necessary calculations, likely requiring a substantial amount of computing resources.

**Additional Notes:**

- Default configurations of Windows servers have a minimum allowable DHE key length of 1024 bits, which reduces the risk.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by increasing the minimum allowable DHE key length to 1024 bits.
- A workaround is provided to disable DHE cipher suites, but this will prevent encrypted TLS sessions that rely on DHE keys from functioning.
- This vulnerability is related to the Logjam technique, which is not specific to Windows, and is an industry-wide issue.
- The update also standardizes TLS False Start ciphers across Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 by removing False Start optimization during cipher negotiation for the following two ciphers on Windows 8 systems:
    - TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA
    - TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_MD5
It also implements a provision for disallowing False Start during RC4 cipher suite negotiation.
