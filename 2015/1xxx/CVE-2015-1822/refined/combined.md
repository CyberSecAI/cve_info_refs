Package        : chrony
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1821 CVE-2015-1822 CVE-2015-1853
Debian Bug     : 782160

Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,
an alternative NTP client and server:

CVE-2015-1821

    Using particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control
    would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-1822

    When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated
    command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could
    trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-1853

    When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
    association, the internal state variables would be updated before the
    MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
    between NTP peers.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.30-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.

Security fixes
--------------
* Protect authenticated symmetric NTP associations against DoS attacks
  (CVE-2015-1799)
* Fix access configuration with subnet size indivisible by 4 (CVE-2015-1821)
* Fix initialization of reply slots for authenticated commands (CVE-2015-1822)

CVE-2015-1799: DoS attack on authenticated symmetric NTP associations

An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with each other
(symmetric association) can send a packet with random timestamps to
host A with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables
on A to the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send on its
next poll to B a packet with originate timestamp that doesn't match
the transmit timestamp of B and the packet will be dropped. If the
attacker does this periodically for both hosts, they won't be able to
synchronize to each other.

Authentication using a symmetric key can fully protect against this
attack, but in implementations following the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) or NTPv4
(RFC 5905) specification the state variables were updated even when
the authentication check failed and the association was not protected.

CVE-2015-1821: Heap-based buffer overflow in access configuration

When NTP or cmdmon access was configured (from chrony.conf or via
authenticated cmdmon) with a subnet size that is indivisible by 4 and
an address that has nonzero bits in the 4-bit subnet remainder (e.g.
192.168.15.0/22 or f000::/3), the new setting was written to an
incorrect location, possibly outside the allocated array.

An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon
(only localhost is allowed by default) could exploit this to crash
chronyd or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
chronyd process.

CVE-2015-1822: Use of uninitialized pointer in command processing

When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated
command requests, the last "next" pointer was not initialized to NULL.
When all allocated reply slots were used, the next reply could be
written to an invalid memory instead of allocating a new slot for it.

An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon
(only localhost is allowed by default) could exploit this to crash
chronyd or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
chronyd process.
