The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin detailing multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-1624.

**CVE-2015-1624**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory corruption in how Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper memory handling leading to potential memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through links in emails or instant messages).
    *   Compromised or user-content websites can be used to host malicious content.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a website containing the exploit and convince the victim to visit it, or they could inject the exploit into a compromised or user-content hosting website. They do not need to be local to the victim machine.
