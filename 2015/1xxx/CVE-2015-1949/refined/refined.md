- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of opcode 1330, leading to command injection via a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted packet to TCP port 11460.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to TCP port 11460 of the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
