Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/04/stable-channel-update_14.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, April 14, 2015

The Chrome team is overjoyed to announce the promotion of Chrome 42 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 42.0.2311.90 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps, extension and Web Platform APIs (including the [Push API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/tip/index.html)!)
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance
* The answer to [life, the universe and everything](https://www.google.com/search?&q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything&gws_rd=ssl)

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/41.0.2272.0..42.0.2311.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [45 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M42&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[476786](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476786)] CVE-2015-1249: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.2 branch (currently 4.2.77.14).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium.(CVE-2015-1235, CVE-2015-1236, CVE-2015-1237, CVE-2015-1238,
CVE-2015-1240, CVE-2015-1241, CVE-2015-1242, CVE-2015-1244, CVE-2015-1245,
CVE-2015-1246, CVE-2015-1247, CVE-2015-1248, CVE-2015-1249)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 42.0.2311.90, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

However, this fails to reset detection for timeout-based events, e.g. delayed tap and double-tap, just after the pointer has just been released. Expose an explicit gesture detection reset hook on the GestureProvider, called when the main frame navigates or the window loses focus.

Naive question: is all the renderer state completely reset on page navigation? Do we need to worry about ensuring the renderer gets touch cancel events?  If we navigate with fingers down, we'll end up getting some extraneous touch end events. I guess at this point, we'll just ignore them, which is fine. It may make input event validation a bit trickier though. ```     | **tdresser** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture\_detection/gesture\_provider\_unittest.cc File ui/events/gesture\_detection/gesture\_provider\_unittest.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture\_detection/gesture\_provider\_unittest.cc#newcode626 ui/events/gesture\_detection/gesture\_provider\_unittest.cc:626: // The long press triggers window focus loss by ... | | --- | | 6 years, 1 month ago (2014-11-11 19:06:47 UTC) [#4](#msg4) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture_detect...](https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture_detection/gesture_provider_unittest.cc) File ui/events/gesture_detection/gesture_provider_unittest.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture_detect...](https://codereview.chromium.org/717573004/diff/20001/ui/events/gesture_detection/gesture_provider_unittest.cc#newcode626) ui/events/gesture_detection/gesture_provider_unittest.cc:626: // The long press triggers window focus loss by opening a context menu.

# CVE-2015-1244

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1243.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1245.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1244 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1244)

#### Description

The URLRequest::GetHSTSRedirect function in url\_request/url\_request.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not replace the ws scheme with the wss scheme whenever an HSTS Policy is active, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network for WebSocket traffic.
