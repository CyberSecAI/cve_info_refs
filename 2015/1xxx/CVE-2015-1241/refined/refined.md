  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2015-1241",
    "Description": "Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not properly consider the interaction of page navigation with the handling of touch events and gesture events, which allows remote attackers to trigger unintended UI actions via a crafted web site that conducts a \"tapjacking\" attack.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Google Chrome handles touch and gesture events during page navigation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of touch and gesture events during page navigation",
     "Inadequate consideration of event interactions during transitions."
   ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can trigger unintended UI actions via a crafted website.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted websites designed to exploit the flaw."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website."
  },
  "Other_data": {
    "Additional Details": "The issue is related to \"tapjacking\", where the attacker manipulates the user interface to trick the user into performing actions they did not intend. The root cause is that Chrome fails to properly reset or cancel touch/gesture events during a main frame navigation. This may leave buffered events targeted to the previous page.",
