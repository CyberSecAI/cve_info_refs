**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability stems from the `NSXMLParser` loading external entities across origins, which can lead to an XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An application using `NSXMLParser` may be misused to disclose sensitive information. This could potentially include local files or internal network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious application can exploit this vulnerability by processing specially crafted XML that includes external entity references, leading to information disclosure.
