Fwiw, the CGI is only accessible for authenticated admin users, so the
consequences of the issue aren't as bad as they could be.

I think it's sufficient if we fix this in a point update, can you take
care of that?

Has this been forwarded upstream? Since it's public we cannot assign
a CVE from the Debian CNA pool any more, so this will need to go through
the oss-security mailing list.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Hi Moritz,

Do you think of Jessie or Wheezy? As far as I can see, Wheezy is
not affected:
[https://sources.debian.net/src/xymon/4.3.0%7Ebeta2.dfsg-9.1/web/bb-ack.c/#L248](https://sources.debian.net/src/xymon/4.3.0~beta2.dfsg-9.1/web/bb-ack.c/#L248)

> Has this been forwarded upstream?

Christoph told me on IRC that upstream is aware of it and has patched
it in SVN, too. I just digged around in upstream's SVN repository and
I think this is the upstream fix:
<http://sourceforge.net/p/xymon/code/7483/>

Actually upstream fixed it in his latest release (4.3.18, September
2014) according to SVN:
<http://sourceforge.net/p/xymon/mailman/message/32876426/>

But that version was never released, neither on SourceForge
(<http://sourceforge.net/projects/xymon/files/Xymon/>) nor on the web
page (<https://www.xymon.com/>) as both still list 4.3.17 as most recent
release -- which is also the reason why I only discovered now that
there actually is a new upstream release.

On the mailing list there is a thread asking about the status of
4.3.18 and someone found a tar ball at <https://www.xymon.com/patches/>.
At least the FreeBSD port maintainer doesn't seem to consider that one
"official" according to
<http://lists.xymon.com/archive/2014-November/040653.html>

		Regards, Axel

I hadn't checked the status in jessie yet, but I just did and you're
right: Wheezy/Squeeze is not affected.

For jessie we can follow the usual upload/unblock procedure.

Ok, I'll request a CVE on oss-security.

Could you please update
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/xymon> with
regards to that fact? TIA!

Has gotten its unblock pre-approval and has been uploaded to Unstable
just now. Will be available on the mirrors with the next push.

I haven't seen such a request on
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/> yet. (I know you
were busy with DSAs in the past few days, but I thought, I'd just sent
a gentle ping. I don't want to request one myself without OK from you
as a similar situation resulted in two CVE ids for the same issue the
last time I tried to request one myself. :-)

As soon we have a CVE-ID I will add it retroactively to the changelog
entry of the just uploaded package, so that it will show up as fixed
in that package release, starting with the next upload.
