Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1632:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2015-1632, described as "Exchange Error Message Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability"

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because Microsoft Exchange Server does not properly sanitize page content in Outlook Web App (OWA). Specifically, the error message functionality in OWA is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is that the application fails to sanitize user-controlled input when rendering an error message. Specifically, the `msgParam` query parameter is vulnerable. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error messages displayed within OWA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the victim user within OWA. This means the attacker can perform actions on the user's behalf, accessing data and potentially manipulating the user's account.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation**: The injected script could be used to steal session cookies, personal data, or modify data in the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker has to entice a user to click on a specially crafted link pointing to OWA. This is likely achieved through phishing emails or malicious links shared via instant messaging.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious link that redirects to the targeted OWA with the crafted payload.
- **Compromised Websites:** Websites accepting user-generated content or already compromised sites can embed the malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious URL that can redirect to an OWA server, including the malicious payload in the `msgParam` parameter.
- Ability to persuade the victim to click the malicious link or visit a webpage with the link.
- No special network access is needed, other than the victim being able to access the malicious link on their network.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Exchange Server handles the `msgParam` query parameter within the `/errorfe.aspx` page.
- The content of `msgParam` is not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of JavaScript code.
- The provided workaround suggests blocking requests to `/errorfe.aspx` with a `msgParam` parameter containing a javascript URI using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
