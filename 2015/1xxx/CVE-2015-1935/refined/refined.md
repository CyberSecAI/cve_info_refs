**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the scalar functions of IBM DB2 LUW. It's a denial of service vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is that a remote, authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
- The vulnerable code is present within the scalar functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the DB2 instance owner.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Authenticated User:** Exploitation requires a user to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of the DB2 database.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- All fix pack levels of IBM DB2 V9.7, V10.1 and V10.5 editions running on AIX, Linux, HP, Solaris, or Windows are affected.
- This includes various editions like Express, Workgroup Server, Enterprise Server, Advanced Enterprise Server, Advanced Workgroup Server, and DB2 Connect editions.
- IBM DB2 pureScale Feature for Enterprise Server Edition, V9.8, running on AIX or Linux is also affected.

**Fix Information:**
- Fixes are available in the following fix packs:
    - DB2 V9.7: FP11
    - DB2 V10.1: FP5
    - DB2 V10.5: FP6
- For DB2 V9.8, customers need to contact support to obtain a special build with an interim fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability allows code execution as the DB2 instance owner, which typically has high privileges within the database system.
- The document also mentions that the DB2 Connect products are only affected if a local database has been created.
- The provided document also includes a list of affected products, the versions impacted, and links to the fix packs.
