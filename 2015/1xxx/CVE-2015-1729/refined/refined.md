**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer not properly enforcing cross-domain policies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper cross-domain policy enforcement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone that they should not have access to.
- This is an information disclosure vulnerability, not remote code execution, meaning that the attacker cannot directly execute code or elevate privileges. However, the disclosed information could be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attack scenario where an attacker hosts a website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content could be used to host malicious content.
- Requires user interaction, where the user is tricked into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site or a site hosting malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a website or inject malicious content into an existing website.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website.
- No specific user rights required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers.
- The document indicates that this vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring cross-domain policies are correctly implemented within Internet Explorer.
- This vulnerability is one of several information disclosure and remote code execution vulnerabilities patched in the same update (MS15-065).
