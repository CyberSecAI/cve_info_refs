{
  "cve": "CVE-2015-1518",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `search_post()` function within `redaxscript/includes/search.php`. The function constructs an SQL query using unfiltered input from the `search_terms` POST parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
	  "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `search_terms` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "network": "HTTP POST request to the `/redaxscript/` endpoint, with a crafted `search_terms` parameter."
    },
	"required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request with a malicious payload in the `search_terms` parameter. No authentication is required, making it easily exploitable."
  },
  "details": {
    "vulnerable_code": "The code constructs the SQL query by concatenating user-supplied input from the `search_terms` POST parameter without proper sanitization.  The `clean()` function is used but it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection",
	"poc": "The proof of concept shows how to send the malicious payload in the `search_terms` parameter to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "fix": "The vulnerability is fixed in Redaxscript version 2.3.0. Users are advised to update to this or a later version.",
	"vendor_communication": "Vendor was informed about the vulnerability on 11/27/2014, they confirmed on 11/28/2014 and released a patch on 01/29/2015."
