Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in the HiveServer2 interface within Apache Hive. Specifically, the issue arises when HiveServer2 is configured to use LDAP authentication mode and is misconfigured to permit simple unauthenticated or anonymous binds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypassed Security Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions due to the misconfiguration in how HiveServer2 handles LDAP authentication.
- **Improper Authentication:** The core problem is that the misconfiguration allows attackers to authenticate without proper credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Authentication with Improper Credentials**: Attackers can authenticate using invalid or incorrect credentials due to the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attack requires network access to the affected HiveServer2 service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the HiveServer2 interface.
- The attacker needs to target a HiveServer2 instance configured for LDAP authentication but allows unauthenticated or anonymous binds.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided IBM Security Bulletin also mentions CVE-2015-1836, which affects Apache HBase but is distinct from CVE-2015-1772 and has been analyzed in another response.
- The CVSS base score for CVE-2015-1772 is 4.3, indicating a moderate severity level.
- The vulnerability is exploitable if HiveServer2 is misconfigured to allow unauthenticated access when using LDAP authentication.
