# Security Bulletin: Infosphere BigInsights is affected by vulnerabilities in Apache HBase and Hive that could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or authenticate with improper credentials (CVE-2015-1772, CVE-2015-1836).

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Infosphere BigInsights is affected by vulnerabilities in Apache HBase and Hive that could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or authenticate with improper credentials (CVE-2015-1772 , CVE-2015-1836).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-1772](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1772) Apache Hive could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in the HiveServer2 interface. If HiveServer2 is configured to use LDAP authentication mode and the configuration permits simple unauthenticated or anonymous binds, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate with improper credentials.
