Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1329:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob` component of the `oxide-qt` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
- Denial of service via application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website. This suggests a network-based attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website visited by the target.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious website.
- No special privileges are required on the target system.
- The user interaction is required for successful exploitation, as they have to open the crafted website.

**Additional Notes:**
