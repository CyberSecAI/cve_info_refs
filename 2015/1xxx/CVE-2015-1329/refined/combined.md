## Details

An uninitialized value issue was discovered in ICU. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1270](/security/CVE-2015-1270))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1272](/security/CVE-2015-1272))

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1276](/security/CVE-2015-1276))

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1277](/security/CVE-2015-1277))

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2015-1280](/security/CVE-2015-1280))

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of

a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1281](/security/CVE-2015-1281))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2015-1283](/security/CVE-2015-1283))

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of

frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-1284](/security/CVE-2015-1284))

It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a

truncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2015-1285](/security/CVE-2015-1285))

An issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1287](/security/CVE-2015-1287))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1289](/security/CVE-2015-1289))

A use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1329](/security/CVE-2015-1329))

A crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5605](/security/CVE-2015-5605))
