A build-packet.c report says "Use after free" but the listed commit
is for an invalid memory read that was fixed in two other .c files.

The keybox_search.c report says "memcpy with overlapping ranges" but
the listed commit apparently fixes "sign extension on shift" issues.

We suspect that what you mean is that the commits are directly
applicable as listed, and the difference is that your report states
the ultimate impact found by afl-fuzz, and your report isn't intended
to directly show how that ultimate impact results from the code
problem.

With this interpretation:

  CVE-2015-1606 - Use after free, resulting from failure to skip
                  invalid packets

  CVE-2015-1607 - memcpy with overlapping ranges, resulting from
                  incorrect bitwise left shifts

There's currently no information suggesting that the NULL pointer
dereference issues could have a security impact; they currently do not
have CVE IDs.

## [Multiple issues in GnuPG found through keyring fuzzing (TFPA 001/2015)](/5-Multiple-issues-in-GnuPG-found-through-keyring-fuzzing-TFPA-0012015.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, February 13. 2015

A complex tool like GnuPG has many ways to parse input data. I previously had fuzzed GnuPG which had led to the detection of a [Buffer Overflow vulnerability in GnuPG and libksba (CVE-2014-9087) and various other minor issues](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/2-Buffer-overflow-and-other-minor-issues-in-GnuPG-and-libksba-TFPA-0012014.html). Recently I tried to fuzz less obvious inputs of GnuPG: Keyrings and configuration files.

GnuPG allows to specify a non-standard keyring on the command line. Fuzzing GPG with

*gpg --export --no-default-keyring --keyring [input keyring]*

led to the detection of various issues. (Please note that the keyring parameter needs the full path and does not like filenames with unusual characters like the ones generated by american fuzzy lop.)

All issues found with american fuzzy lop. Fuzzing of the configuration file parser showed no issues.

While keyrings are usually not user-submitted data, some of these can be reached through other code paths. None of the issues looks severe, however judging the exact security would require further analysis.

Nice job. After 2 months of fuzzing GnuPG 2.1.1 (--list-packet) with afl-fuzz, no crashes found (with a classic input, one NIST-P256 key).

Did you try the keyserver part (--recv-key) ?

Package        : gnupg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3591 CVE-2015-0837 CVE-2015-1606

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:

CVE-2014-3591

    The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.

CVE-2015-0837

    The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.

CVE-2015-1606

    The keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet
    types not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory
    already freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (crash) via crafted keyring files.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.18-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
