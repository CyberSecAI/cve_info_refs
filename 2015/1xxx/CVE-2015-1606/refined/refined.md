Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of certain packet types in the keyring parsing code. Specifically, the code failed to reject certain packet types that do not belong in a keyring.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This occurs because the code does not properly validate packet types within keyring files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, causing the GnuPG application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Keyring Files:** The attack vector involves providing GnuPG with specially crafted keyring files. These files contain the invalid packet types that trigger the use-after-free.
- **Command Line Argument:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by using the `--keyring` command-line option of GnuPG to load a malicious keyring file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted keyring file to GnuPG. This might be through a direct command-line argument or possibly through other code paths.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- Although keyrings are not typically user-submitted data, the vulnerability can be reached through other code paths.
- The issue was fixed in GnuPG version 2.1.2.
- Debian has released a security advisory (DSA-3184-1) addressing this vulnerability, with fixes available in versions 1.4.12-7+deb7u7 (wheezy), 1.4.18-7 (jessie and sid).
