Based on the provided data, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1287:

**CVE-2015-1287**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass issue within the Blink rendering engine of Google Chrome. Specifically, it occurs due to a quirk-mode exception that relaxes the requirement for CSS documents to have the `text/css` content type. This means that a crafted web site can bypass the Same Origin Policy by leveraging this loophole. The root cause is in the `core/fetch/CSSStyleSheetResource.cpp` file according to the CVE description from MITRE and SUSE.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SOP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to circumvent the Same Origin Policy, which is a critical security mechanism in web browsers. This policy prevents scripts from one origin (domain, protocol, port) from accessing resources from a different origin.
    *   **CSS Handling:** The vulnerability lies in how Blink handles CSS resources, allowing a CSS document without proper MIME type to be treated as legitimate and processed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information that would normally be protected by the SOP.
    *  **Integrity Impact (None):** The attacker cannot modify or tamper with data.
    *  **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-Based:** The attack is initiated remotely over the network.
    *   **Crafted Web Site:** An attacker needs to create a malicious or crafted web page to trigger the vulnerability by loading css files without a text/css content type.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or control a web server with malicious content.
    *   **Web Server/Hosting:** An attacker needs a web server to host the crafted website.
    *   **Web Injection:** An attacker can inject the malicious css content to a web page to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome versions prior to 44.0.2403.89.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in the stable release of Google Chrome 44.0.2403.89.
*   Red Hat also issued a security advisory (RHSA-2015:1499) to address the issue.
*   SUSE also issued a security advisory (openSUSE-SU-2015:1287-1) to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "important" by SUSE and "medium" severity by Red Hat.
*  The vulnerability is present in Blink, the rendering engine used by Chrome.
