Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an I/O vector array overrun in the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read and write functionality. The implementations of `pipe_read` and `pipe_write` in `fs/pipe.c` did not correctly account for the side effects of failed `__copy_to_user_inatomic` and `__copy_from_user_inatomic` calls when retrying after a failed atomic access operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **I/O vector array overrun:** The core vulnerability lies in the incorrect accounting of processed I/O vectors during retries after a failed atomic copy. The code attempts to fault in user memory, use atomic copies and when it fails and goes to slow path, it does not account for already read/written parts of iovecs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption due to the I/O vector array overrun.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local, unprivileged user can trigger a system crash.
*  **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability has the potential for a local, unprivileged user to escalate their privileges on the system by exploiting memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to create a crafted application that triggers the specific conditions in the `pipe_read` or `pipe_write` function where the iovec overrun occurs.
*   **Ability to interact with pipes:** The attacker needs to be able to read from or write to pipes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some of the provided content (e.g., SUSE Security Advisory) states that the vulnerability was fixed by updating the kernel, indicating that the fix involves changes within the kernel source code.
*   The provided github diff shows a change to the pipe_read() function, replacing a manual copy operation with copy_page_to_iter(). The related commit message mentions a new helper: copy_page_from_iter()
*   The vulnerability arises from not accounting for data already processed in I/O vectors after a failed atomic access attempt.
