{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Foreman did not perform SSL certificate validation when making a connection to an LDAP authentication source.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of SSL certificate validation when making LDAPS connections.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the connection between Foreman and the LDAP server and potentially gain access to user credentials by presenting a malicious server certificate.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack during an LDAPS connection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between Foreman and the LDAP server."
