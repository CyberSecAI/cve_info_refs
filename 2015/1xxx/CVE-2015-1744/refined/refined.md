The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS15-056) that addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. CVE-2015-1744 is one of the vulnerabilities discussed, and here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
*   CVE-2015-1744 is caused by a memory corruption vulnerability. Specifically, Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Memory corruption: Improper handling of objects in memory. This vulnerability is a type of flaw where the state of the program's memory is corrupted, possibly leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This means that the attacker gains the same level of access as the user logged into the machine, and they can then take various actions such as installing programs, deleting data, and creating new user accounts.
*  The severity is rated as "Critical" on Windows client systems and "Moderate" on Windows servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Web-based attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
*   Compromised websites:  Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content/advertisements to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Social Engineering:  Attackers need to convince users to view the malicious content which can be done through links in emails, instant messages, or by opening email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject the exploit code into an existing website.
*   The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious page or open malicious content using Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**

* The document indicates that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
* The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
