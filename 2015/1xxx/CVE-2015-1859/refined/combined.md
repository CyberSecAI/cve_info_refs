# USN-2626-1: Qt vulnerabilities

3 June 2015

Qt could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [qt4-x11](/security/cves?package=qt4-x11) - Qt 4 libraries
* [qtbase-opensource-src](/security/cves?package=qtbase-opensource-src) - Qt 5 libraries

## Details

Wolfgang Schenk discovered that Qt incorrectly handled certain malformed

GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted GIF image, a remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0190](/security/CVE-2014-0190))

Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled certain malformed BMP

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially

crafted BMP image, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause Qt to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0295](/security/CVE-2015-0295))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed BMP images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted BMP image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1858](/security/CVE-2015-1858))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed ICO images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted ICO image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1859](/security/CVE-2015-1859))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted GIF image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1860](/security/CVE-2015-1860))

# QtGui: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QtGui allowing remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-qt/qtgui** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.4.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.4.1-r1**revision >= **4.8.6-r4**revision >= **4.8.7** |

### Background

QtGui is the GUI module and platform plugins for the Qt framework

### Description

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in QtGui.
It is possible for remote attackers to construct specially crafted BMP,
ICO, or GIF images that lead to buffer overflows. After successfully
overflowing the buffer the remote attacker can then cause a Denial of
Service or execute arbitrary code.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code or cause Denial
of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

All QtGui 4.8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-qt/qtgui-4.8.6-r4"

```

All QtGui 5.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-qt/qtgui-5.4.1-r1"

```
