Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is that Qt incorrectly handled certain malformed ICO images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Qt library when processing malformed ICO images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash of the application using Qt).
*   A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted ICO image file.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered if a user or an automated system is tricked into opening such a malicious ICO file using an application that relies on the vulnerable Qt library for image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver the specially crafted ICO file to a target user or system.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target but needs to be able to entice the user or system into processing the malicious file.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The provided text describes the vulnerability in Qt, specifically in how it handles malformed ICO image files, leading to potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The text also specifies that other image formats like BMP and GIF were also vulnerable and were fixed at the same time as this vulnerability.  It also notes that multiple versions of Ubuntu were affected and provides update instructions for those versions.
The Gentoo Security Advisory also covers this vulnerability, referring to it as a buffer overflow that leads to remote code execution or denial of service. It lists the affected package as `dev-qt/qtgui` on all architectures with versions below 5.4.1-r1 or 4.8.6-r4 being vulnerable.
