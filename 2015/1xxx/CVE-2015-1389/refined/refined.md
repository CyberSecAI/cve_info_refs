Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization on the login form of the Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager. Specifically, the username field is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field of the login form. This script is then stored by the application.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize the input received in the username field, allowing the execution of malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** A successful XSS attack can enable the attacker to steal session cookies of privileged, authenticated users when they access the audit logs. This gives the attacker the ability to impersonate the user and gain access to their account.
*   **Potential for other malicious actions:**  Beyond session hijacking, the attacker could potentially redirect the user to malicious websites, alter content, or perform other client-side attacks within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the login form of the Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager.
*   **Input Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious script, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1337)>`, into the username field during a login attempt.
*  **Audit Log Trigger:** The injected payload is triggered when a privileged user views the access logs, where the stored username is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious script.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable username field and understand how to inject the malicious script.
*  **Targeted User:** The attack requires a privileged user to view the audit log in order to trigger the injected payload.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported on November 24, 2014, by Cristiano Maruti.
*   The vendor, Aruba, acknowledged the issue on December 9, 2014 and released a fix on February 16, 2015 (ClearPass 6.5 or later).
*   The vulnerable version is Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager 6.4
* The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity risk.
