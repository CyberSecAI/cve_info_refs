Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1592:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `Storable::thaw` function in Perl. This function is used to deserialize Perl data structures, and in this case, it's being applied to data provided by unauthenticated remote users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the unsafe deserialization of user-provided data using `Storable::thaw`. This function is vulnerable to code injection when used with untrusted input.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By crafting a malicious serialized data structure, an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary local Perl files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although a local file inclusion was the initial example, the vulnerability can be exploited for arbitrary remote code execution. By tailoring the malicious payload to the specific Perl environment on the target system, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the Movable Type server, allowing attackers to gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require any prior authentication.
*   **Data Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting specially crafted, malicious serialized data into the application through interfaces where `Storable::thaw` is used on user-supplied input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Movable Type server.
*   **Knowledge of Perl:** While not explicitly stated, crafting a successful RCE payload likely requires knowledge of Perl and the target server's Perl environment to execute arbitrary code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Movable Type versions prior to 6.0.7 and 5.2.12.
*   The issue is present in both open-source and commercial versions of Movable Type.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Six Apart.

In summary, CVE-2015-1592 is a critical vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution on vulnerable Movable Type servers through unsafe deserialization of attacker-supplied data.
