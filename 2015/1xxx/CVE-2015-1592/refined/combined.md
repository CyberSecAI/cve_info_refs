Package        : movabletype-opensource
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2184 CVE-2014-9057 CVE-2015-1592
Debian Bug     : 712602 774192

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Movable Type, a
blogging system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2184

    Unsafe use of Storable::thaw in the handling of comments to blog
    posts could allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
    local Perl files or possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-9057

    Netanel Rubin from Check Point Software Technologies discovered a
    SQL injection vulnerability in the XML-RPC interface allowing
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2015-1592

    The Perl Storable::thaw function is not properly used, allowing
    remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local Perl files
    and possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.4+dfsg-4+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.

Subject: CVE request: MovableType before 5.2.12

Hi there,

MoveableType 5.2.12 was released today to fix a flaw where Perl's
Storable::thaw() was called on data sent by unauthenticated remote users
in some interfaces.

<https://movabletype.org/news/2015/02/movable_type_607_and_5212_released_to_close_security_vulnera.html>

The payload example provided to SixApart was a local file inclusion
attack, but unauthenticated arbitrary remote code execution should be
straightforward by tailoring the payload for the mix of Perl installed
on the system running MTOS.

Please assign a CVE number for this issue.

John

Use CVE-2015-1592.

There aren't separate CVE IDs for different impacts of the underlying
"called on data sent by unauthenticated remote users" issue.

# Movable Type 6.0.7 and 5.2.12 released to close security vulnerability

We are releasing Movable Type 6.0.7 and 5.2.12 as mandatory security updates. These updates resolved security-related issue discovered in all previous versions of Movable Type 6 and Movable Type 5. We strongly recommend upgrading to a modified version.

## Details of the security updates

In previous versions, including the Movable Type 6.0.6 and 5.2.11 are susceptible to LFI (local file inclusion) attacks due to the vulnerability of Storable perl module. It allows an attacker to include a file and run any perl script the web server.

## STEPS REQUIRED TO CLOSE THE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

Please upgrade to the latest versions of Movable Type:

* Movable Type Pro 6.0.7
* Movable Type Pro 5.2.12
* Movable Type Open Source 5.2.12
* Movable Type Advanced 6.0.7
* Movable Type Advanced 5.2.12

## VERSIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED

* Movable Type Pro 6.1
* Movable Type Advanced 6.1

Movable Type 6.1 is already solved this issue.

## WARNINGS

Movable Type 5.0x and 5.1x has reached End of Life and is no longer supported. For users that are running any version of 5.0x and 5.1x, please upgrade to Movable Type 5.2.12, which is available at no additional charge to paid licensees of Movable Type 5 or users of Movable Type Open Source.

## AVAILABILITY OF UPDATED VERSIONS OF MOVABLE TYPE
