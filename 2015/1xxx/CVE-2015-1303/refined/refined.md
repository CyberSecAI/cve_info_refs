Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1303 and CVE-2015-1304:

**CVE-2015-1303:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in `bindings/core/v8/V8DOMWrapper.h` within the Blink rendering engine. It fails to properly rethrow cross-context exceptions, which leads to a Same Origin Policy bypass.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of exceptions during cross-context operations. Specifically, the lack of propagation of information about cross-context exceptions.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can bypass the Same Origin Policy, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or manipulating resources from another domain.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML document, typically containing an IFRAME element, to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to entice a victim into loading the specially crafted HTML document. No authentication is required for this attack.

**CVE-2015-1304:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The issue is within `object-observe.js` in the Google V8 JavaScript engine. Method calls on access-checked objects are not properly restricted.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate access controls on JavaScript objects when performing method calls, potentially allowing access from different origins.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can bypass the Same Origin Policy through a crafted webpage. This could allow for the manipulation or theft of data across different origins
*    **Attack Vector:** The attack is executed via an `observe` or `getNotifier` call, with the attacker needing to trick a user into loading malicious web content that invokes these calls on improperly restricted objects.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required, and the attacker can remotely exploit the vulnerability through the victim's browser when they visit a malicious website.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   Both vulnerabilities are cross-origin bypass issues and rated as **high/important** severity.
*   These vulnerabilities were fixed in Chromium version **45.0.2454.101**.
*   Patches for these vulnerabilities were included in various Linux distributions, including openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Red Hat.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Mariusz Mlynski.
*   The `oxide-qt` package in Ubuntu was also updated to address these vulnerabilities.

**Summary**

Both CVE-2015-1303 and CVE-2015-1304 describe vulnerabilities related to cross-origin policy bypasses. CVE-2015-1303 is related to how exceptions are handled in the Blink rendering engine. CVE-2015-1304 concerns how method calls on JavaScript objects are restricted in the V8 engine. An attacker can potentially access data from different origins by enticing a victim to visit a crafted webpage.
