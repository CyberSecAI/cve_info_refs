  "cve": "CVE-2015-1395",
  "description": "The GNU patch utility, versions 2.7.1-1, 2.7.1-6, and 2.7.1-7, is vulnerable to a directory traversal via file rename. This allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by applying a specially crafted patch with the privileges of the user running patch.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "2.7.1-1",
    "2.7.1-6",
    "2.7.1-7"
   ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of file renames within git-style patch files. Specifically, the patch utility does not properly validate the target file path during rename operations, allowing a crafted patch to specify a path outside the intended directory.",
  "vulnerability": "Directory traversal via file rename.",
  "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the patch program.",
  "attack_vector": "A specially crafted patch file can be created by an attacker with malicious file rename instructions targeting a file outside of the intended directory.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious patch file and convince a user to apply it. The attacker doesn't need any specific user privileges.",
