patch now support git-style patches, which allows renaming files. This
feature can be abused for directory traversal. As a proof of concept,
applying the attached patch creates a file in /tmp:

$ ls /tmp/moo
/bin/ls: cannot access /tmp/moo: No such file or directory

$ mkdir empty && cd empty

$ patch -p1 < ~/traversal2.diff
patching file moo
patching file ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/moo (renamed from moo)

$ ls /tmp/moo
/tmp/moo

Seems the previous fix was incomplete, if I understand the traffic
correctly.

I think this needs a new CVE. [CVE-2015-1196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1196) was assigned for the
following:

 [1] <https://bugs.debian.org/775227>
 [2] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1196>

and the directory traversal via file rename does not seem to have a
CVE yet? (retitling back this subject just to avoid confusion).

Regards,
Salvatore

 OK, but please note that there are three CVE number requests
now[1][2][3]. Fixes are released and the packaging is ready. Should I
wait for the CVE number assignment to note those in changelog or
better if I upload the new version?

IMO, if you have patches ready to fix these issues, you can go ahead
with an upload if CVEs are not assigned by then, since for all but one
we have also a reference in the BTS identifying the issue.

# USN-2651-1: GNU patch vulnerabilities

22 June 2015

Several security issues were fixed in GNU patch.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [patch](/security/cves?package=patch) - Apply a diff file to an original

## Details

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle file paths in

patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could

overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-4651](/security/CVE-2010-4651))

László Böszörményi discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle some

patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-9637](/security/CVE-2014-9637))

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle symbolic links in

git style patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that

could overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2015-1196](/security/CVE-2015-1196))

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle file renames in

git style patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that

could overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2015-1395](/security/CVE-2015-1395))

Jakub Wilk discovered the fix for [CVE-2015-1196](/security/CVE-2015-1196) was incomplete for GNU patch.

An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could overwrite arbitrary

files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2015-1396](/security/CVE-2015-1396))

patch now support git-style patches, which allows renaming files. This
feature can be abused for directory traversal. As a proof of concept,
applying the attached patch creates a file in /tmp:

$ ls /tmp/moo
/bin/ls: cannot access /tmp/moo: No such file or directory

$ mkdir empty && cd empty

$ patch -p1 < ~/traversal2.diff
patching file moo
patching file ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/moo (renamed from moo)

$ ls /tmp/moo
/tmp/moo

Seems the previous fix was incomplete, if I understand the traffic
correctly.

I think this needs a new CVE. [CVE-2015-1196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1196) was assigned for the
following:

 [1] <https://bugs.debian.org/775227>
 [2] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1196>

and the directory traversal via file rename does not seem to have a
CVE yet? (retitling back this subject just to avoid confusion).

Regards,
Salvatore

 OK, but please note that there are three CVE number requests
now[1][2][3]. Fixes are released and the packaging is ready. Should I
wait for the CVE number assignment to note those in changelog or
better if I upload the new version?

IMO, if you have patches ready to fix these issues, you can go ahead
with an upload if CVEs are not assigned by then, since for all but one
we have also a reference in the BTS identifying the issue.

Regards,
Salvatore

p.s.: don't use the TEMP names in the changelog, since they can change
      over time.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1184490#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-21 14:30:18 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the versions of the patch utility that support Git-style patches are vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by applying a specially crafted patch, with the privileges of the user running patch. A reproducer for this issue is available in [1].  Upstream bugreport: <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?44059>  [1]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775873>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1184490#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-21 14:34:03 UTC  ```  Created patch tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1184491](show_bug.cgi?id=1184491 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9637 patch: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1184490#c2)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-30 23:54:16 UTC  ``` patch-2.7.3-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1184490#c3)  Fedora Update System    2015-04-04 07:20:44 UTC  ``` patch-2.7.5-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1184490#c4)  Vincent Danen    2015-07-31 04:43:08 UTC  ``` This is really only problematic if you're a) running patch on patch files you've not inspected first or b) are running patch as root.  In either case, you shouldn't be patching things as root unless they're trusted and possibly it's worth inspecting patch files first.  Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |
