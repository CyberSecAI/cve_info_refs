Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unbounded string copy operation within the `Open` method of the `IOPOSScanner` and `IOPOSScale` ActiveX controls. Specifically, the methods copy attacker-supplied input into fixed-length stack buffers without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow caused by the unbounded string copy. This occurs because the `Open` method does not validate the size of the input before copying it into a stack buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation**: The vulnerable code does not check the length of the attacker controlled input, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser process on a vulnerable system. This means an attacker can gain control over the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can create a malicious web page that, when visited by a vulnerable user, would exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious File:** A malicious file containing the exploit could also trigger the vulnerability upon being opened by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the capability to deliver a malicious file or have a user visit a malicious webpage.
- **User Interaction:** The exploit requires user interaction, in that the user needs to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected products are the `Scanner SDK` from Motorola Solutions, specifically the `OPOSScanner.ocx` and `OPOSScale.ocx` ActiveX controls.
-  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability via Digital Vaccine filters `16777` and `16776`, depending on which control is being exploited.
- Motorola has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Motorola on 2014-10-10, and the coordinated public release of advisory was on 2015-02-10
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ariele Caltabiano (kimiya).
