Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1745:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer merges attributes of HTML elements. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force the creation of a `CAttrValue` object with uninitialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uninitialized Data:** The core issue is the use of uninitialized data within the `CAttrValue` object. This leads to memory corruption when the uninitialized data is used improperly.
- **Memory Corruption:** The improper access of objects in memory due to uninitialized data can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Although this vulnerability itself does not directly provide privilege escalation, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that has privilege escalation capabilities, allowing an attacker to elevate the privileges of their arbitrary code.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, a successful exploit could give the attacker complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based Attack:** The attacker would host a malicious website containing specially crafted HTML to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
- **Phishing:** Users would be tricked into visiting the malicious site or opening a malicious file, often via email or instant messaging links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through web browsing.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is classified as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer (6 through 11).
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19603'].
