Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to access a user's browser history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of browser history access within Internet Explorer.
- Lack of sufficient access control mechanisms to prevent malicious sites from reading browser history.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to a user's browsing history. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the user's activities, visited websites, and potentially even credentials if they are stored in the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website hosted by the attacker.
- Compromised websites or those that host user-provided content could also be used to deliver the malicious content.
- Users must be tricked into visiting the malicious website, often through social engineering techniques such as malicious links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website or control content on a website that a target user visits.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target.
- The attacker relies on convincing users to visit the malicious web page.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided document is part of a larger security bulletin (MS15-056) addressing multiple vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
- The bulletin highlights that Enhanced Security Configuration in Internet Explorer on Windows Servers can act as a mitigating factor for websites not added to the Trusted Sites zone.
- The bulletin also mentions EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) as a tool to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities, but this is not directly related to CVE-2015-1765.

The document provides more detail than the initial CVE description by outlining the attack vector and the potential for exposure of browser history.
