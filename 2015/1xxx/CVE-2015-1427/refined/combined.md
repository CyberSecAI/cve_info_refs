# RHSA-2017:0868 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R2 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was reported that Elasticsearch had vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine, which allow an attacker to construct scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM. (CVE-2015-1427)
* It was found that a flaw in Apache groovy library allows remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an attacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2016-6814)
* It was found that Apache Commons HttpClient does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. (CVE-2012-5783)
* It was found that swagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names in the JSON document. An attacker could use this flaw to supply a key name with script tags which could cause arbitrary code execution. Additionally it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the URL query-string parameter. (CVE-2016-1000229)
* A vulnerability was found in FormattedServiceListWriter in Apache CXF HTTP transport module that could allow an attacker to inject unexpected matrix parameters into the request URL. On a successful injection these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client. (CVE-2016-6812)
* Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides a number of Atom MessageBodyReaders. These readers use Apache Abdera Parser to parse Atom feeds or Entries, with this Parser expanding XML entities by default. It was found that this represents a major XXE risk. (CVE-2016-8739)
* A path traversal issue was found in Spark version 2.5 and potentially earlier versions. The vulnerability resides in the functionality to serve static files where there's no protection against directory traversal attacks. This could allow attackers access to private files including sensitive data. (CVE-2016-9177)
* It was found that the camel-snakeyaml component is exploitable for code execution. An attacker could use this vulnerability to send specially crafted payload to a camel-snakeyaml endpoint and causing a remote code execution attack. (CVE-2017-3159)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-12 10:12:23 UTC  ``` It was reported that Elasticsearch versions 1.3.0-1.3.7 and 1.4.0-1.4.2 have vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine. The vulnerability allows an attacker to construct Groovy scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM.  Upstream bug report: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9655>  Upstream fixes: 1.3: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/69735b0f4ab9ad7df4b82e8c917589b52cb9978c> 1.4: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/4e952b2d75de6ca4caf4b6743462714f3b60d07f> 1.x: <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/716f0b24dc5414616e8dc0590dbfcfa0081be892>  Mitigation: Users can address the vulnerability by setting script.groovy.sandbox.enabled to false in config/elasticsearch.yml and restarting the node.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-10 14:13:15 UTC  ``` Upstream announcement of fixed versions 1.3.8 and 1.4.3 which describes the issue: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-1-4-3-and-1-3-8-released/>  Those versions address the issue by disallowing the use of Groovy for dynamic scripting rather than fixing the sandbox bypass.  The following upstream blog post describes how to use scripts stored in Elasticsearch (indexed script) or on disk: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/running-groovy-scripts-without-dynamic-scripting/>  This blog post describes how to exploit this issue: <https://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/2015/03/08/elasticsearch-rce-vulnerability-cve-2015-1427/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-10 14:19:02 UTC  ``` This issue has similar impact to [CVE-2014-3120](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3120) ([bug 1124252](show_bug.cgi?id=1124252 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3120 elasticsearch: remote code execution flaw via dynamic scripting")), adjusting impact rating accordingly.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-04-03 21:02:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2017:0868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0868)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1191969#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-02 15:51:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2017:0868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0868)   ``` |  |

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
