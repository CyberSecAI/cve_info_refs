CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7421 CVE-2014-7822 CVE-2014-8160 CVE-2014-8559
                 CVE-2014-9585 CVE-2014-9644 CVE-2014-9683 CVE-2015-0239
                 CVE-2015-1420 CVE-2015-1421 CVE-2015-1593

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation.

CVE-2013-7421 / CVE-2014-9644

    It was discovered that the Crypto API allowed unprivileged users
    to load arbitrary kernel modules. A local user can use this flaw
    to exploit vulnerabilities in modules that would not normally be
    loaded.

CVE-2014-7822

    Akira Fujita found that the splice() system call did not validate
    the given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
    this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
    possibly other effects.

CVE-2014-8160

    Florian Westphal discovered that a netfilter (iptables/ip6tables) rule
    accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
    port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
    If only the generic connection tracking module (nf_conntrack) was
    loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
    this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
    protocol.

CVE-2014-8559

    It was found that kernel functions that iterate over a directory
    tree can dead-lock or live-lock in case some of the directory
    entries were recently deleted or dropped from the cache. A local
    unprivileged user can use this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2014-9585

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO
    in 64-bit processes is extremely biased. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
    mechanism.

CVE-2014-9683

    Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
    the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
    in local denial of service.

CVE-2015-0239

    It was found that KVM did not correctly emulate the x86 SYSENTER
    instruction. An unprivileged user within a guest system that has
    not enabled SYSENTER, for example because the emulated CPU vendor
    is AMD, could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation in that guest.

CVE-2015-1420

    It was discovered that the open_by_handle_at() system call reads
    the handle size from user memory a second time after validating
    it. A local user with the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability could use
    this flaw for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1421

    It was found that the SCTP implementation could free an
    authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
    corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1593

    It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
    64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
    A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
    bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u2. Additionally this update fixes regressions
introduced in versions 3.2.65-1 and 3.2.65-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon (a subset is fixed already).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
(a subset is fixed already).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-13 15:42:47 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that stack address is not properly randomized on some 64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow. The stack entropy of the processes is reduced by four. The possible locations are significantly reduced from around one billion to two hundred millions. The problem seems to affect only to the x86_64 architecture. Proposed patch: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/7/811>  [1]: <http://hmarco.org/bugs/linux-ASLR-integer-overflow.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-13 15:43:09 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1192520](show_bug.cgi?id=1192520 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-1593 kernel: Linux stack ASLR implementation Integer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c2)  Petr Matousek    2015-02-20 13:49:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affect the Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates in the respective releases may address this issue.  This issue does affect the Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

# USN-2560-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

8 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-80-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP

(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

([CVE-2015-1421](/security/CVE-2015-1421))

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets

to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker on the same subnet can exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-1465](/security/CVE-2015-1465))

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Description

The stack randomization feature in the Linux kernel before 3.19.1 on 64-bit platforms uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by predicting the address of the top of the stack, related to the randomize\_stack\_top function in fs/binfmt\_elf.c and the stack\_maxrandom\_size function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [906545](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=906545) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [911325](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=911325) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

x86/spinlocks/paravirt: Fix memory corruption on unlock
commit d6abfdb2022368d8c6c4be3f11a06656601a6cc2 upstream.
Paravirt spinlock clears slowpath flag after doing unlock.
As explained by Linus currently it does:
prev = \*lock;
add\_smp(&lock->tickets.head, TICKET\_LOCK\_INC);
/\* add\_smp() is a full mb() \*/
if (unlikely(lock->tickets.tail & TICKET\_SLOWPATH\_FLAG))
\_\_ticket\_unlock\_slowpath(lock, prev);
which is \*exactly\* the kind of things you cannot do with spinlocks,
because after you've done the "add\_smp()" and released the spinlock
for the fast-path, you can't access the spinlock any more. Exactly
because a fast-path lock might come in, and release the whole data
structure.
Linus suggested that we should not do any writes to lock after unlock(),
and we can move slowpath clearing to fastpath lock.
So this patch implements the fix with:
1. Moving slowpath flag to head (Oleg):
Unlocked locks don't care about the slowpath flag; therefore we can keep
it set after the last unlock, and clear it again on the first (try)lock.
-- this removes the write after unlock. note that keeping slowpath flag would
result in unnecessary kicks.
By moving the slowpath flag from the tail to the head ticket we also avoid
the need to access both the head and tail tickets on unlock.
2. use xadd to avoid read/write after unlock that checks the need for
unlock\_kick (Linus):
We further avoid the need for a read-after-release by using xadd;
the prev head value will include the slowpath flag and indicate if we
need to do PV kicking of suspended spinners -- on modern chips xadd
isn't (much) more expensive than an add + load.

kernel: make READ\_ONCE() valid on const arguments
commit dd36929720f40f17685e841ae0d4c581c165ea60 upstream.
The use of READ\_ONCE() causes lots of warnings witht he pending paravirt
spinlock fixes, because those ends up having passing a member to a
'const' structure to READ\_ONCE().
There should certainly be nothing wrong with using READ\_ONCE() with a
const source, but the helper function \_\_read\_once\_size() would cause
warnings because it would drop the 'const' qualifier, but also because
the destination would be marked 'const' too due to the use of 'typeof'.
Use a union of types in READ\_ONCE() to avoid this issue.
Also make sure to use parenthesis around the macro arguments to avoid
possible operator precedence issues.

Commit b568b8601f05 ("Treat SCI interrupt as normal GSI interrupt")
accidently removes support of legacy PIC interrupt when fixing a
regression for Xen, which causes a nasty regression on HP/Compaq
nc6000 where we fail to register the ACPI interrupt, and thus
lose eg. thermal notifications leading a potentially overheated
machine.
So reintroduce support of legacy PIC based ACPI SCI interrupt.

x86, mm/ASLR: Fix stack randomization on 64-bit systems
commit 4e7c22d447bb6d7e37bfe39ff658486ae78e8d77 upstream.
The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly randomized on
64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.
The affected function is randomize\_stack\_top() in file
"fs/binfmt\_elf.c":
static unsigned long randomize\_stack\_top(unsigned long stack\_top)
{
unsigned int random\_variable = 0;
if ((current->flags & PF\_RANDOMIZE) &&
!(current->personality & ADDR\_NO\_RANDOMIZE)) {
random\_variable = get\_random\_int() & STACK\_RND\_MASK;
random\_variable <<= PAGE\_SHIFT;
}
return PAGE\_ALIGN(stack\_top) + random\_variable;
return PAGE\_ALIGN(stack\_top) - random\_variable;
}
Note that, it declares the "random\_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK\_RND\_MASK (which
is 0x3fffff on x86\_64, 22 bits) and PAGE\_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86\_64):
random\_variable <<= PAGE\_SHIFT;
then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
"random\_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
the (22+12) result.
These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).
This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
in the operations in the functions randomize\_stack\_top() and
stack\_maxrandom\_size().
The successful fix can be tested with:
$ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
...
Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
rather than always being 7fff.

x86/efi: Avoid triple faults during EFI mixed mode calls
commit 96738c69a7fcdbf0d7c9df0c8a27660011e82a7b upstream.
Andy pointed out that if an NMI or MCE is received while we're in the
middle of an EFI mixed mode call a triple fault will occur. This can
happen, for example, when issuing an EFI mixed mode call while running
perf.
The reason for the triple fault is that we execute the mixed mode call
in 32-bit mode with paging disabled but with 64-bit kernel IDT handlers
installed throughout the call.
At Andy's suggestion, stop playing the games we currently do at runtime,
such as disabling paging and installing a 32-bit GDT for \_\_KERNEL\_CS. We
can simply switch to the \_\_KERNEL32\_CS descriptor before invoking
firmware services, and run in compatibility mode. This way, if an
NMI/MCE does occur the kernel IDT handler will execute correctly, since
it'll jump to \_\_KERNEL\_CS automatically.
However, this change is only possible post-ExitBootServices(). Before
then the firmware "owns" the machine and expects for its 32-bit IDT
handlers to be left intact to service interrupts, etc.
So, we now need to distinguish between early boot and runtime
invocations of EFI services. During early boot, we need to restore the
GDT that the firmware expects to be present. We can only jump to the
\_\_KERNEL32\_CS code segment for mixed mode calls after ExitBootServices()
has been invoked.
A liberal sprinkling of comments in the thunking code should make the
differences in early and late environments more apparent.

blk-throttle: check stats\_cpu before reading it from sysfs

When reading blkio.throttle.io\_serviced in a recently created blkio

which delays the allocation of stats\_cpu.
Like other functions in the throttle code, just checking for a NULL

Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after adding hard link to inode
commit 1a4bcf470c886b955adf36486f4c86f2441d85cb upstream.
We have a scenario where after the fsync log replay we can lose file data
that had been previously fsync'ed if we added an hard link for our inode
and after that we sync'ed the fsync log (for example by fsync'ing some
other file or directory).
This is because when adding an hard link we updated the inode item in the
log tree with an i\_size value of 0. At that point the new inode item was
in memory only and a subsequent fsync log replay would not make us lose
the file data. However if after adding the hard link we sync the log tree
to disk, by fsync'ing some other file or directory for example, we ended
up losing the file data after log replay, because the inode item in the
persisted log tree had an an i\_size of zero.
This is easy to reproduce, and the following excerpt from my test for
xfstests shows this:
\_scratch\_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
\_init\_flakey
\_mount\_flakey
# Create one file with data and fsync it.
# This made the btrfs fsync log persist the data and the inode metadata with
# a correct inode->i\_size (4096 bytes).
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa -b 4K 0 4K" -c "fsync" \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Now add one hard link to our file. This made the btrfs code update the fsync
# log, in memory only, with an inode metadata having a size of 0.
ln $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo\_link
# Now force persistence of the fsync log to disk, for example, by fsyncing some
# other file.
touch $SCRATCH\_MNT/bar
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/bar
# Before a power loss or crash, we could read the 4Kb of data from our file as
# expected.
echo "File content before:"
od -t x1 $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
# Simulate a crash/power loss.
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_DROP\_WRITES
\_unmount\_flakey
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_ALLOW\_WRITES
\_mount\_flakey
# After the fsync log replay, because the fsync log had a value of 0 for our
# inode's i\_size, we couldn't read anymore the 4Kb of data that we previously
# wrote and fsync'ed. The size of the file became 0 after the fsync log replay.
echo "File content after:"
od -t x1 $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
Another alternative test, that doesn't need to fsync an inode in the same
transaction it was created, is:
\_scratch\_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
\_init\_flakey
\_mount\_flakey
# Create our test file with some data.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa -b 8K 0 8K" \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Make sure the file is durably persisted.
sync
# Append some data to our file, to increase its size.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xcc -b 4K 8K 4K" \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Fsync the file, so from this point on if a crash/power failure happens, our
# new data is guaranteed to be there next time the fs is mounted.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
# Add one hard link to our file. This made btrfs write into the in memory fsync
# log a special inode with generation 0 and an i\_size of 0 too. Note that this
# didn't update the inode in the fsync log on disk.
ln $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo\_link
# Now make sure the in memory fsync log is durably persisted.
# Creating and fsync'ing another file will do it.
touch $SCRATCH\_MNT/bar
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/bar
# As expected, before the crash/power failure, we should be able to read the
# 12Kb of file data.
echo "File content before:"
od -t x1 $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
# Simulate a crash/power loss.
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_DROP\_WRITES
\_unmount\_flakey
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_ALLOW\_WRITES
\_mount\_flakey
# After mounting the fs again, the fsync log was replayed.
# The btrfs fsync log replay code didn't update the i\_size of the persisted
# inode because the inode item in the log had a special generation with a
# value of 0 (and it couldn't know the correct i\_size, since that inode item
# had a 0 i\_size too). This made the last 4Kb of file data inaccessible and
# effectively lost.
echo "File content after:"
od -t x1 $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
This isn't a new issue/regression. This problem has been around since the
log tree code was added in 2008:
Btrfs: Add a write ahead tree log to optimize synchronous operations
(commit e02119d5a7b4396c5a872582fddc8bd6d305a70a)
Test cases for xfstests follow soon.

btrfs: fix leak of path in btrfs\_find\_item
commit 381cf6587f8a8a8e981bc0c1aaaa8859b51dc756 upstream.
If btrfs\_find\_item is called with NULL path it allocates one locally but
does not free it. Affected paths are inserting an orphan item for a file
and for a subvol root.
Move the path allocation to the callers.

libceph: fix double \_\_remove\_osd() problem
commit 7eb71e0351fbb1b242ae70abb7bb17107fe2f792 upstream.
It turns out it's possible to get \_\_remove\_osd() called twice on the
same OSD. That doesn't sit well with rb\_erase() - depending on the
shape of the tree we can get a NULL dereference, a soft lockup or
a random crash at some point in the future as we end up touching freed
memory. One scenario that I was able to reproduce is as follows:
con\_fault\_finish()
osd\_reset()
ceph\_osdc\_handle\_map()
kick\_requests()
reset\_changed\_osds()
\_\_reset\_osd()
\_\_remove\_osd()
\_\_kick\_osd\_requests()
\_\_reset\_osd()
\_\_remove\_osd() <-- !!!
A case can be made that osd refcounting is imperfect and reworking it
would be a proper resolution, but for now Sage and I decided to fix
this by adding a safe guard around \_\_remove\_osd().

samsung-laptop: Add use\_native\_backlight quirk, and enable it on some models
commit 4690555e13c48fef07f2762f6b0cd6b181e326d0 upstream.
Since kernel 3.14 the backlight control has been broken on various Samsung
Atom based netbooks. This has been bisected and this problem happens since
commit b35684b8fa94 ("drm/i915: do full backlight setup at enable time")
This has been reported and discussed in detail here:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2014-July/049395.html
Unfortunately no-one has been able to fix this. This only affects Samsung
Atom netbooks, and the Linux kernel and the BIOS of those laptops have never
worked well together. All affected laptops already have a quirk to avoid using
the standard acpi-video interface and instead use the samsung specific SABI
interface which samsung-laptop uses. It seems that recent fixes to the i915
driver have also broken backlight control through the SABI interface.
The intel\_backlight driver OTOH works fine, and also allows for finer grained
backlight control. So add a new use\_native\_backlight quirk, and replace the
broken\_acpi\_video quirk with this quirk for affected models. This new quirk
disables acpi-video as before and also stops samsung-laptop from registering
the SABI based samsung\_laptop backlight interface, leaving only the working
intel\_backlight interface.
This commit enables this new quirk for 3 models which are known to be affected,
chances are that it needs to be used on other models too.

sb\_edac: Fix detection on SNB machines
commit 11249e73992981e31fd50e7231da24fad68e3320 upstream.
d0585cd815fa ("sb\_edac: Claim a different PCI device") changed the
probing of sb\_edac to look for PCI device 0x3ca0:
3f:0e.0 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Xeon E5/Core i7 Processor Home Agent (rev 07)
00: 86 80 a0 3c 00 00 00 00 07 00 80 08 00 00 80 00
...
but we're matching for 0x3ca8, i.e. PCI\_DEVICE\_ID\_INTEL\_SBRIDGE\_IMC\_TA
in sbridge\_probe() therefore the probing fails.
Changing it to probe for 0x3ca0 (PCI\_DEVICE\_ID\_INTEL\_SBRIDGE\_IMC\_HA0),
.i.e., the 14.0 device, fixes the issue and driver loads successfully
again:
[ 2449.013120] EDAC DEBUG: sbridge\_init:
[ 2449.017029] EDAC sbridge: Seeking for: PCI ID 8086:3ca0

Add a debug printk while at it to be able to catch the failure in the
future and dump driver version on successful load.

md/raid1: fix read balance when a drive is write-mostly.
commit d1901ef099c38afd11add4cfb3312c02ef21ec4a upstream.
When a drive is marked write-mostly it should only be the
target of reads if there is no other option.
This behaviour was broken by
commit 9dedf60313fa4dddfd5b9b226a0ef12a512bf9dc
md/raid1: read balance chooses idlest disk for SSD
which causes a write-mostly device to be \*preferred\* is some cases.
Restore correct behaviour by checking and setting
best\_dist\_disk and best\_pending\_disk rather than best\_disk.
We only need to test one of these as they are both changed
from -1 or >=0 at the same time.
As we leave min\_pending and best\_dist unchanged, any non-write-mostly
device will appear better than the write-mostly device.

md/raid5: Fix livelock when array is both resyncing and degraded.
commit 26ac107378c4742978216be1005b7291b799c7b2 upstream.
Commit a7854487cd7128a30a7f4f5259de9f67d5efb95f:
md: When RAID5 is dirty, force reconstruct-write instead of read-modify-write.
Causes an RCW cycle to be forced even when the array is degraded.
A degraded array cannot support RCW as that requires reading all data
blocks, and one may be missing.
Forcing an RCW when it is not possible causes a live-lock and the code
spins, repeatedly deciding to do something that cannot succeed.
So change the condition to only force RCW on non-degraded arrays.

perf tools: Fix probing for PERF\_FLAG\_FD\_CLOEXEC flag
commit 48536c9195ae8c2a00fd8f400bac72ab613feaab upstream.
Commit f6edb53c4993ffe92ce521fb449d1c146cea6ec2 converted the probe to
a CPU wide event first (pid == -1). For kernels that do not support
the PERF\_FLAG\_FD\_CLOEXEC flag the probe fails with EINVAL. Since this
errno is not handled pid is not reset to 0 and the subsequent use of
pid = -1 as an argument brings in an additional failure path if
perf\_event\_paranoid > 0:
$ perf record -- sleep 1
perf\_event\_open(..., 0) failed unexpectedly with error 13 (Permission denied)
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.007 MB /tmp/perf.data (11 samples) ]
Also, ensure the fd of the confirmation check is closed and comment why
pid = -1 is used.
Needs to go to 3.18 stable tree as well.

clocksource: mtk: Fix race conditions in probe code
commit d4a19eb3b15a4ba98f627182f48d5bc0cffae670 upstream.
We have two race conditions in the probe code which could lead to a null
pointer dereference in the interrupt handler.
The interrupt handler accesses the clockevent device, which may not yet be
registered.
First race condition happens when the interrupt handler gets registered before
the interrupts get disabled. The second race condition happens when the
interrupts get enabled, but the clockevent device is not yet registered.
Fix that by disabling the interrupts before we register the interrupt and enable
the interrupts after the clockevent device got registered.

metag: Fix KSTK\_EIP() and KSTK\_ESP() macros
commit c2996cb29bfb73927a79dc96e598a718e843f01a upstream.
The KSTK\_EIP() and KSTK\_ESP() macros should return the user program
counter (PC) and stack pointer (A0StP) of the given task. These are used
to determine which VMA corresponds to the user stack in
/proc//maps, and for the user PC & A0StP in /proc//stat.
However for Meta the PC & A0StP from the task's kernel context are used,
resulting in broken output. For example in following /proc//maps
output, the 3afff000-3b021000 VMA should be described as the stack:
# cat /proc/self/maps
...
100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]
3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
And in the following /proc//stat output, the PC is in kernel code
(1074234964 = 0x40078654) and the A0StP is in the kernel heap
(1335981392 = 0x4fa17550):
# cat /proc/self/stat
51 (cat) R ... 1335981392 1074234964 ...
Fix the definitions of KSTK\_EIP() and KSTK\_ESP() to use
task\_pt\_regs(tsk)->ctx rather than (tsk)->thread.kernel\_context. This
gets the registers from the user context stored after the thread info at
the base of the kernel stack, which is from the last entry into the
kernel from userland, regardless of where in the kernel the task may
have been interrupted, which results in the following more correct
/proc//maps output:
# cat /proc/self/maps
...
0800b000-08070000 r-xp 00000000 00:02 207 /lib/libuClibc-0.9.34-git.so
...
100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]
3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
And /proc//stat now correctly reports the PC in libuClibc
(134320308 = 0x80190b4) and the A0StP in the [stack] region (989864576 =
0x3b002280):
# cat /proc/self/stat

xfs: Fix quota type in quota structures when reusing quota file
commit dfcc70a8c868fe03276fa59864149708fb41930b upstream.
For filesystems without separate project quota inode field in the
superblock we just reuse project quota file for group quotas (and vice
versa) if project quota file is allocated and we need group quota file.
When we reuse the file, quota structures on disk suddenly have wrong
type stored in d\_flags though. Nobody really cares about this (although
structure type reported to userspace was wrong as well) except
that after commit 14bf61ffe6ac (quota: Switch ->get\_dqblk() and
->set\_dqblk() to use bytes as space units) assertion in
xfs\_qm\_scall\_getquota() started to trigger on xfs/106 test (apparently I
was testing without XFS\_DEBUG so I didn't notice when submitting the
above commit).
Fix the problem by properly resetting ddq->d\_flags when running quotacheck
for a quota file.

arm64: compat Fix siginfo\_t -> compat\_siginfo\_t conversion on big endian
commit 9d42d48a342aee208c1154696196497fdc556bbf upstream.
The native (64-bit) sigval\_t union contains sival\_int (32-bit) and
sival\_ptr (64-bit). When a compat application invokes a syscall that
takes a sigval\_t value (as part of a larger structure, e.g.
compat\_sys\_mq\_notify, compat\_sys\_timer\_create), the compat\_sigval\_t
union is converted to the native sigval\_t with sival\_int overlapping
with either the least or the most significant half of sival\_ptr,
depending on endianness. When the corresponding signal is delivered to a
compat application, on big endian the current (compat\_uptr\_t)sival\_ptr
cast always returns 0 since sival\_int corresponds to the top part of
sival\_ptr. This patch fixes copy\_siginfo\_to\_user32() so that sival\_int
is copied to the compat\_siginfo\_t structure.

KVM: s390: forward hrtimer if guest ckc not pending yet
commit 2d00f759427bb3ed963b60f570830e9eca7e1c69 upstream.
Patch 0759d0681cae ("KVM: s390: cleanup handle\_wait by reusing
kvm\_vcpu\_block") changed the way pending guest clock comparator
interrupts are detected. It was assumed that as soon as the hrtimer
wakes up, the condition for the guest ckc is satisfied.
This is however only true as long as adjclock() doesn't speed
up the monotonic clock. Reason is that the hrtimer is based on
CLOCK\_MONOTONIC, the guest clock comparator detection is based
on the raw TOD clock. If CLOCK\_MONOTONIC runs faster than the
TOD clock, the hrtimer wakes the target VCPU up too early and
the target VCPU will not detect any pending interrupts, therefore
going back to sleep. It will never be woken up again because the
hrtimer has finished. The VCPU is stuck.
As a quick fix, we have to forward the hrtimer until the guest
clock comparator is really due, to guarantee properly timed wake
ups.
As the hrtimer callback might be triggered on another cpu, we
have to make sure that the timer is really stopped and not currently
executing the callback on another cpu. This can happen if the vcpu
thread is scheduled onto another physical cpu, but the timer base
is not migrated. So lets use hrtimer\_cancel instead of try\_to\_cancel.
A proper fix might be to introduce a RAW based hrtimer.

MIPS: HTW: Prevent accidental HTW start due to nested htw\_{start, stop}
commit ed4cbc81addbc076b016c5b979fd1a02f0897f0a upstream.
activate\_mm() and switch\_mm() call get\_new\_mmu\_context() which in turn
can enable the HTW before the entryhi is changed with the new ASID.
Since the latter will enable the HTW in local\_flush\_tlb\_all(),
then there is a small timing window where the HTW is running with the
new ASID but with an old pgd since the TLBMISS\_HANDLER\_SETUP\_PGD
hasn't assigned a new one yet. In order to prevent that, we introduce a
simple htw counter to avoid starting HTW accidentally due to nested
htw\_{start,stop}() sequences. Moreover, since various IPI calls can
enforce TLB flushing operations on a different core, such an operation
may interrupt another htw\_{stop,start} in progress leading inconsistent
updates of the htw\_seq variable. In order to avoid that, we disable the
interrupts whenever we update that variable.

ARC: fix page address calculation if PAGE\_OFFSET != LINUX\_LINK\_BASE
commit 06f34e1c28f3608b0ce5b310e41102d3fe7b65a1 upstream.
We used to calculate page address differently in 2 cases:
1. In virt\_to\_page(x) we do
--->8---
mem\_map + (x - CONFIG\_LINUX\_LINK\_BASE) >> PAGE\_SHIFT
--->8---
2. In in pte\_page(x) we do
--->8---
mem\_map + (pte\_val(x) - PAGE\_OFFSET) >> PAGE\_SHIFT
--->8---
That leads to problems in case PAGE\_OFFSET != CONFIG\_LINUX\_LINK\_BASE -
different pages will be selected depending on where and how we calculate
page address.
In particular in the STAR 9000853582 when gdb attempted to read memory
of another process it got improper page in get\_user\_pages() because this
is exactly one of the places where we search for a page by pte\_page().
The fix is trivial - we need to calculate page address similarly in both
cases.

When the UART is in DMA receive mode (RDMAS set) and one character
just arrived while another interrupt is handled (e.g. TX), the RDRF
(receiver data register full flag) is set due to the water level of
1. But since the DMA will take care of this character, there is no
need to handle it by calling lpuart\_prepare\_rx. Handling it leads to
adding the RX timeout timer twice:

ntp: Fixup adjtimex freq validation on 32-bit systems
commit 29183a70b0b828500816bd794b3fe192fce89f73 upstream.
Additional validation of adjtimex freq values to avoid
potential multiplication overflows were added in commit
5e5aeb4367b (time: adjtimex: Validate the ADJ\_FREQUENCY values)
Unfortunately the patch used LONG\_MAX/MIN instead of
LLONG\_MAX/MIN, which was fine on 64-bit systems, but being
much smaller on 32-bit systems caused false positives
resulting in most direct frequency adjustments to fail w/
EINVAL.
ntpd only does direct frequency adjustments at startup, so
the issue was not as easily observed there, but other time
sync applications like ptpd and chrony were more effected by
the bug.
See bugs:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=92481
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1188074
This patch changes the checks to use LLONG\_MAX for
clarity, and additionally the checks are disabled
on 32-bit systems since LLONG\_MAX/PPM\_SCALE is always
larger then the 32-bit long freq value, so multiplication
overflows aren't possible there.

kdb: Avoid printing KERN\_ levels to consoles
commit f7d4ca8bbfda23b4f1eae9b6757ff64166b093d5 upstream.
Currently when kdb traps printk messages then the raw log level prefix
(consisting of '\001' followed by a numeral) does not get stripped off
before the message is issued to the various I/O handlers supported by
kdb. This causes annoying visual noise as well as causing problems
grepping for ^. It is also a change of behaviour compared to normal usage
of printk() usage. For example -h ends up with different output to
that of kdb's "sr h".
This patch addresses the problem by stripping log levels from messages
before they are issued to the I/O handlers. printk() which can also
act as an i/o handler in some cases is special cased; if the caller
provided a log level then the prefix will be preserved when sent to
printk().
The addition of non-printable characters to the output of kdb commands is a
regression, albeit and extremely elderly one, introduced by commit
04d2c8c83d0e ("printk: convert the format for KERN\_ to a 2 byte
pattern"). Note also that this patch does \*not\* restore the original
behaviour from v3.5. Instead it makes printk() from within a kdb command
display the message without any prefix (i.e. like printk() normally does).

USB: add flag for HCDs that can't receive wakeup requests (isp1760-hcd)
commit 074f9dd55f9cab1b82690ed7e44bcf38b9616ce0 upstream.
Currently the USB stack assumes that all host controller drivers are
capable of receiving wakeup requests from downstream devices.
However, this isn't true for the isp1760-hcd driver, which means that
it isn't safe to do a runtime suspend of any device attached to a
root-hub port if the device requires wakeup.
This patch adds a "cant\_recv\_wakeups" flag to the usb\_hcd structure
and sets the flag in isp1760-hcd. The core is modified to prevent a
direct child of the root hub from being put into runtime suspend with
wakeup enabled if the flag is set.

USB: don't cancel queued resets when unbinding drivers
commit 524134d422316a59d5464ccbc12036bbe90c5563 upstream.
The USB stack provides a mechanism for drivers to request an
asynchronous device reset (usb\_queue\_reset\_device()). The mechanism
uses a work item (reset\_ws) embedded in the usb\_interface structure
used by the driver, and the reset is carried out by a work queue
routine.
The asynchronous reset can race with driver unbinding. When this
happens, we try to cancel the queued reset before unbinding the
driver, on the theory that the driver won't care about any resets once
it is unbound.
However, thanks to the fact that lockdep now tracks work queue
accesses, this can provoke a lockdep warning in situations where the
device reset causes another interface's driver to be unbound; see
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=141893165203776&w=2
for an example. The reason is that the work routine for reset\_ws in
one interface calls cancel\_queued\_work() for the reset\_ws in another
interface. Lockdep thinks this might lead to a work routine trying to
cancel itself. The simplest solution is not to cancel queued resets
when unbinding drivers.
This means we now need to acquire a reference to the usb\_interface
when queuing a reset\_ws work item and to drop the reference when the
work routine finishes. We also need to make sure that the
usb\_interface structure doesn't outlive its parent usb\_device; this
means acquiring and dropping a reference when the interface is created
and destroyed.
In addition, cancelling a queued reset can fail (if the device is in
the middle of an earlier reset), and this can cause usb\_reset\_device()
to try to rebind an interface that has been deallocated (see
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=142175717016628&w=2 for details).
Acquiring the extra references prevents this failure.

usb: core: buffer: smallest buffer should start at ARCH\_DMA\_MINALIGN
commit 5efd2ea8c9f4f12916ffc8ba636792ce052f6911 upstream.
the following error pops up during "testusb -a -t 10"
| musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.1.auto: dma\_pool\_free buffer-128, f134e000/be842000 (bad dma)
hcd\_buffer\_create() creates a few buffers, the smallest has 32 bytes of
size. ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN is set to 64 bytes. This combo results in
hcd\_buffer\_alloc() returning memory which is 32 bytes aligned and it
might by identified by buffer\_offset() as another buffer. This means the
buffer which is on a 32 byte boundary will not get freed, instead it
tries to free another buffer with the error message.
This patch fixes the issue by creating the smallest DMA buffer with the
size of ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN (or 32 in case ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN is
smaller). This might be 32, 64 or even 128 bytes. The next three pools
will have the size 128, 512 and 2048.
In case the smallest pool is 128 bytes then we have only three pools
instead of four (and zero the first entry in the array).
The last pool size is always 2048 bytes which is the assumed PAGE\_SIZE /
2 of 4096. I doubt it makes sense to continue using PAGE\_SIZE / 2 where
we would end up with 8KiB buffer in case we have 16KiB pages.
Instead I think it makes sense to have a common size(s) and extend them
if there is need to.
There is a BUILD\_BUG\_ON() now in case someone has a minalign of more than
128 bytes.

tty/serial: at91: fix error handling in atmel\_serial\_probe()
commit 6fbb9bdf0f3fbe23aeff806489791aa876adaffb upstream.
-EDEFER error wasn't handle properly by atmel\_serial\_probe().
As an example, when atmel\_serial\_probe() is called for the first time, we pass
the test\_and\_set\_bit() test to check whether the port has already been
initalized. Then we call atmel\_init\_port(), which may return -EDEFER, possibly
returned before by clk\_get(). Consequently atmel\_serial\_probe() used to return
this error code WITHOUT clearing the port bit in the "atmel\_ports\_in\_use" mask.
When atmel\_serial\_probe() was called for the second time, it used to fail on
the test\_and\_set\_bit() function then returning -EBUSY.
When atmel\_serial\_probe() fails, this patch make it clear the port bit in the
"atmel\_ports\_in\_use" mask, if needed, before returning the error code.

tty/serial: at91: enable peripheral clock before accessing I/O registers
commit d4f641876a68d1961e30c202709cc2d484f69f6f upstream.
atmel\_serial\_probe() calls atmel\_init\_port(). In turn, atmel\_init\_port() calls
clk\_disable\_unprepare() to disable the peripheral clock before returning.
Later atmel\_serial\_probe() accesses some I/O registers such as the Mode and
Control registers for RS485 support then the Name and Version registers, through a call to
atmel\_get\_ip\_name(), but at that moment the peripheral clock was still
disabled.

smack: fix possible use after frees in task\_security() callers
commit 6d1cff2a885850b78b40c34777b46cf5da5d1050 upstream.
We hit use after free on dereferncing pointer to task\_smack struct in
smk\_of\_task() called from smack\_task\_to\_inode().
task\_security() macro uses task\_cred\_xxx() to get pointer to the task\_smack.
task\_cred\_xxx() could be used only for non-pointer members of task's
credentials. It cannot be used for pointer members since what they point
to may disapper after dropping RCU read lock.
Mainly task\_security() used this way:
smk\_of\_task(task\_security(p))
Intead of this introduce function smk\_of\_task\_struct() which
takes task\_struct as argument and returns pointer to smk\_known struct
and do this under RCU read lock.
Bogus task\_security() macro is not used anymore, so remove it.

ring-buffer: Do not wake up a splice waiter when page is not full
commit 1e0d6714aceb770b04161fbedd7765d0e1fc27bd upstream.
When an application connects to the ring buffer via splice, it can only
read full pages. Splice does not work with partial pages. If there is
not enough data to fill a page, the splice command will either block
or return -EAGAIN (if set to nonblock).
Code was added where if the page is not full, to just sleep again.
The problem is, it will get woken up again on the next event. That
is, when something is written into the ring buffer, if there is a waiter
it will wake it up. The waiter would then check the buffer, see that
it still does not have enough data to fill a page and go back to sleep.
To make matters worse, when the waiter goes back to sleep, it could
cause another event, which would wake it back up again to see it
doesn't have enough data and sleep again. This produces a tremendous
overhead and fills the ring buffer with noise.
For example, recording sched\_switch on an idle system for 10 seconds
produces 25,350,475 events!!!
Create another wait queue for those waiters wanting full pages.
When an event is written, it only wakes up waiters if there's a full
page of data. It does not wake up the waiter if the page is not yet
full.
After this change, recording sched\_switch on an idle system for 10
seconds produces only 800 events. Getting rid of 25,349,675 useless
events (99.9969% of events!!), is something to take seriously.

cipso: don't use IPCB() to locate the CIPSO IP option
commit 04f81f0154e4bf002be6f4d85668ce1257efa4d9 upstream.
Using the IPCB() macro to get the IPv4 options is convenient, but
unfortunately NetLabel often needs to examine the CIPSO option outside
of the scope of the IP layer in the stack. While historically IPCB()
worked above the IP layer, due to the inclusion of the inet\_skb\_param
struct at the head of the {tcp,udp}\_skb\_cb structs, recent commit
971f10ec ("tcp: better TCP\_SKB\_CB layout to reduce cache line misses")
reordered the tcp\_skb\_cb struct and invalidated this IPCB() trick.
This patch fixes the problem by creating a new function,
cipso\_v4\_optptr(), which locates the CIPSO option inside the IP header
without calling IPCB(). Unfortunately, this isn't as fast as a simple
lookup so some additional tweaks were made to limit the use of this
new function.

cfq-iosched: fix incorrect filing of rt async cfqq
commit c6ce194325cef342313e3d27620411ce90a89c50 upstream.
Hi,
If you can manage to submit an async write as the first async I/O from
the context of a process with realtime scheduling priority, then a
cfq\_queue is allocated, but filed into the wrong async\_cfqq bucket. It
ends up in the best effort array, but actually has realtime I/O
scheduling priority set in cfqq->ioprio.
The reason is that cfq\_get\_queue assumes the default scheduling class and
priority when there is no information present (i.e. when the async cfqq
is created):
static struct cfq\_queue \*
cfq\_get\_queue(struct cfq\_data \*cfqd, bool is\_sync, struct cfq\_io\_cq \*cic,
struct bio \*bio, gfp\_t gfp\_mask)
{
const int ioprio\_class = IOPRIO\_PRIO\_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
const int ioprio = IOPRIO\_PRIO\_DATA(cic->ioprio);
cic->ioprio starts out as 0, which is "invalid". So, class of 0
(IOPRIO\_CLASS\_NONE) is passed to cfq\_async\_queue\_prio like so:
async\_cfqq = cfq\_async\_queue\_prio(cfqd, ioprio\_class, ioprio);
static struct cfq\_queue \*\*
cfq\_async\_queue\_prio(struct cfq\_data \*cfqd, int ioprio\_class, int ioprio)
{
switch (ioprio\_class) {
case IOPRIO\_CLASS\_RT:
return &cfqd->async\_cfqq[0][ioprio];
case IOPRIO\_CLASS\_NONE:
ioprio = IOPRIO\_NORM;
/\* fall through \*/
case IOPRIO\_CLASS\_BE:
return &cfqd->async\_cfqq[1][ioprio];
case IOPRIO\_CLASS\_IDLE:
return &cfqd->async\_idle\_cfqq;
default:
BUG();
}
}
Here, instead of returning a class mapped from the process' scheduling
priority, we get back the bucket associated with IOPRIO\_CLASS\_BE.
Now, there is no queue allocated there yet, so we create it:
cfqq = cfq\_find\_alloc\_queue(cfqd, is\_sync, cic, bio, gfp\_mask);
That function ends up doing this:
cfq\_init\_cfqq(cfqd, cfqq, current->pid, is\_sync);
cfq\_init\_prio\_data(cfqq, cic);
cfq\_init\_cfqq marks the priority as having changed. Then, cfq\_init\_prio
data does this:
ioprio\_class = IOPRIO\_PRIO\_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
switch (ioprio\_class) {
default:
printk(KERN\_ERR "cfq: bad prio %x\n", ioprio\_class);
case IOPRIO\_CLASS\_NONE:
/\*
\* no prio set, inherit CPU scheduling settings
\*/
cfqq->ioprio = task\_nice\_ioprio(tsk);
cfqq->ioprio\_class = task\_nice\_ioclass(tsk);
break;
So we basically have two code paths that treat IOPRIO\_CLASS\_NONE
differently, which results in an RT async cfqq filed into a best effort
bucket.
Attached is a patch which fixes the problem. I'm not sure how to make
it cleaner. Suggestions would be welcome.

cfq-iosched: handle failure of cfq group allocation
commit 69abaffec7d47a083739b79e3066cb3730eba72e upstream.
Cfq\_lookup\_create\_cfqg() allocates struct blkcg\_gq using GFP\_ATOMIC.
In cfq\_find\_alloc\_queue() possible allocation failure is not handled.
As a result kernel oopses on NULL pointer dereference when
cfq\_link\_cfqq\_cfqg() calls cfqg\_get() for NULL pointer.
Bug was introduced in v3.5 in commit cd1604fab4f9 ("blkcg: factor
out blkio\_group creation"). Prior to that commit cfq group lookup
had returned pointer to root group as fallback.
This patch handles this error using existing fallback oom\_cfqq.

This patch drops legacy active\_ts\_list usage within iscsi\_target\_tq.c
code. It was originally used to track the active thread sets during
iscsi-target shutdown, and is no longer used by modern upstream code.
Two people have reported list corruption using traditional iscsi-target

to iscsi\_thread\_set->ts\_list being used across both active\_ts\_list and

sg: fix EWOULDBLOCK errors with scsi-mq
commit 7772855a996ec6e16944b120ab5ce21050279821 upstream.
With scsi-mq enabled, userspace programs can get unexpected EWOULDBLOCK
(a.k.a. EAGAIN) errors when submitting commands to the SCSI generic
driver. Fix by calling blk\_get\_request() with GFP\_KERNEL instead of
GFP\_ATOMIC.
Note: to avoid introducing a potential deadlock, this patch should be

sg: fix unkillable I/O wait deadlock with scsi-mq
commit 7568615c1054907ea8c7701ab86dad51aa099888 upstream.
When using the write()/read() interface for submitting commands, the
SCSI generic driver does not call blk\_put\_request() on a completed SCSI
command until userspace calls read() to get the command completion.
Since scsi-mq uses a fixed number of preallocated requests, this makes
it possible for userspace to exhaust the entire preallocated supply of
requests. For places in the kernel that call blk\_get\_request() with
GFP\_KERNEL, this can cause the calling process to deadlock in a
permanent unkillable I/O wait in blk\_get\_request() -> ... -> bt\_get().
For places in the kernel that call blk\_get\_request() with GFP\_ATOMIC,
this can cause blk\_get\_request() always to return -EWOULDBLOCK. Note
that these problems happen only if scsi-mq is enabled. Prevent the
problems by calling blk\_put\_request() as soon as the SCSI command
completes instead of waiting for userspace to call read().

commit eb71f8a5e33fa1066fb92f0111ab366a341e1f6c upstream.
The tpm\_ibmvtpm module is affected by an unaligned access problem.
ibmvtpm\_crq\_get\_version failed with rc=-4 during boot when vTPM is

big endian modes.
We added little endian support to fix this problem:

When sending data in tpm\_stm\_i2c\_send, each loop iteration send buf.
Send buf + i instead as the goal of this for loop is to send a number
of byte from buf that fit in burstcnt. Once those byte are sent, we are
supposed to send the next ones.
The driver was working because the burstcount value returns always the maximum size for a TPM

tpm: Fix NULL return in tpm\_ibmvtpm\_get\_desired\_dma
commit 84eb186bc37c0900b53077ca21cf6dd15823a232 upstream.
There was an oops in tpm\_ibmvtpm\_get\_desired\_dma, which caused
kernel panic during boot when vTPM is enabled in Power partition
configured in AMS mode.
vio\_bus\_probe calls vio\_cmo\_bus\_probe which calls
tpm\_ibmvtpm\_get\_desired\_dma to get the size needed for DMA allocation.
The problem is, vio\_cmo\_bus\_probe is called before calling probe, which
for vtpm is tpm\_ibmvtpm\_probe and it's this function that initializes
and sets up vtpm's CRQ and gets required data values. Therefore,
since this has not yet been done, NULL is returned in attempt to get
the size for DMA allocation.
We added a NULL check. In addition, a default buffer size will
be set when NULL is returned.

an array map\_pages that contains the addresses returned by

is unmapped before map\_pages[1], breaking the nesting requirement
as specified in the documentation for kmap\_atomic/kunmap\_atomic.
This was caught by the highmem debug code present in kunmap\_atomic.
Fix the loop to do the unmapping properly.

mm/hugetlb: pmd\_huge() returns true for non-present hugepage
commit cbef8478bee55775ac312a574aad48af7bb9cf9f upstream.
Migrating hugepages and hwpoisoned hugepages are considered as non-present
hugepages, and they are referenced via migration entries and hwpoison
entries in their page table slots.
This behavior causes race condition because pmd\_huge() doesn't tell
non-huge pages from migrating/hwpoisoned hugepages. follow\_page\_mask() is
one example where the kernel would call follow\_page\_pte() for such
hugepage while this function is supposed to handle only normal pages.
To avoid this, this patch makes pmd\_huge() return true when pmd\_none() is
true \*and\* pmd\_present() is false. We don't have to worry about mixing up
non-present pmd entry with normal pmd (pointing to leaf level pte entry)
because pmd\_present() is true in normal pmd.
The same race condition could happen in (x86-specific) gup\_pmd\_range(),
where this patch simply adds pmd\_present() check instead of pmd\_huge().
This is because gup\_pmd\_range() is fast path. If we have non-present
hugepage in this function, we will go into gup\_huge\_pmd(), then return 0
at flag mask check, and finally fall back to the slow path.

MIPS: asm: pgtable: Prevent HTW race when updating PTEs
commit fde3538a8a711aedf1173ecb2d45aed868f51c97 upstream.
Whenever we modify a page table entry, we need to ensure that the HTW
will not fetch a stable entry. And for that to happen we need to ensure
that HTW is stopped before we modify the said entry otherwise the HTW
may already be in the process of reading that entry and fetching the
old information. As a result of which, we replace the htw\_reset() calls
with htw\_{stop,start} in more appropriate places. This also removes the
remaining users of htw\_reset() and as a result we drop that macro

MIPS: asm: asmmacro: Replace "add" instructions with "addu"
commit 98a833c1fa4de0695830f77b2d13fd86693da298 upstream.
The "add" instruction is actually a macro in binutils and depending on
the size of the immediate it can expand to an "addi" instruction.
However, the "addi" instruction traps on overflows which is not
something we want on address calculation.

MIPS: Alchemy: Fix cpu clock calculation
commit 69e4e63ec816a7e22cc3aa14bc7ef4ac734d370c upstream.
The current code uses bits 0-6 of the sys\_cpupll register to calculate
core clock speed. However this is only valid on Au1300, on all earlier
models the hardware only uses bits 0-5 to generate core clock.
This fixes clock calculation on the MTX1 (Au1500), where bit 6 of cpupll
is set as well, which ultimately lead the code to calculate a bogus cpu
core clock and also uart base clock down the line.

KVM: MIPS: Don't leak FPU/DSP to guest
commit f798217dfd038af981a18bbe4bc57027a08bb182 upstream.
The FPU and DSP are enabled via the CP0 Status CU1 and MX bits by
kvm\_mips\_set\_c0\_status() on a guest exit, presumably in case there is
active state that needs saving if pre-emption occurs. However neither of
these bits are cleared again when returning to the guest.
This effectively gives the guest access to the FPU/DSP hardware after
the first guest exit even though it is not aware of its presence,
allowing FP instructions in guest user code to intermittently actually
execute instead of trapping into the guest OS for emulation. It will
then read & manipulate the hardware FP registers which technically
belong to the user process (e.g. QEMU), or are stale from another user
process. It can also crash the guest OS by causing an FP exception, for
which a guest exception handler won't have been registered.
First lets save and disable the FPU (and MSA) state with lose\_fpu(1)
before entering the guest. This simplifies the problem, especially for
when guest FPU/MSA support is added in the future, and prevents FR=1 FPU
state being live when the FR bit gets cleared for the guest, which
according to the architecture causes the contents of the FPU and vector
registers to become UNPREDICTABLE.
We can then safely remove the enabling of the FPU in
kvm\_mips\_set\_c0\_status(), since there should never be any active FPU or
MSA state to save at pre-emption, which should plug the FPU leak.
DSP state is always live rather than being lazily restored, so for that
it is simpler to just clear the MX bit again when re-entering the guest.

KVM: MIPS: Disable HTW while in guest
commit c4c6f2cad9e1d4cc076bc183c3689cc9e7019c75 upstream.
Ensure any hardware page table walker (HTW) is disabled while in KVM
guest mode, as KVM doesn't yet set up hardware page table walking for
guest mappings so the wrong mappings would get loaded, resulting in the
guest hanging or crashing once it reaches userland.
The HTW is disabled and re-enabled around the call to
\_\_kvm\_mips\_vcpu\_run() which does the initial switch into guest mode and
the final switch out of guest context. Additionally it is enabled for
the duration of guest exits (i.e. kvm\_mips\_handle\_exit()), getting
disabled again before returning back to guest or host.
In all cases the HTW is only disabled in normal kernel mode while
interrupts are disabled, so that the HTW doesn't get left disabled if
the process is preempted.

nfs41\_callback\_svc does most of its work while in TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE,
which is just wrong. Fix that by finishing the wait immediately if we've
found that the list has something on it.
Also, we don't expect this kthread to accept signals, so we should be
using a TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep instead. That however, opens us up
hung task warnings from the watchdog, so have the schedule\_timeout
wake up every 60s if there's no callback activity.

According to erratum 'ERR-7878951' Armada 38x SDHCI controller has
different capabilities than the ones shown in its registers:
- it doesn't support the voltage switching: it can work either with
3.3V or 1.8V supply
- it doesn't support the SDR104 mode
- SDR50 mode doesn't need tuning
The SDHCI\_QUIRK\_MISSING\_CAPS quirk is used for updating the
capabilities accordingly.

Current code checks "clk\_delay\_cycles > 0" to know whether the optional
"mrvl,clk\_delay\_cycles" is set or not. But of\_property\_read\_u32() doesn't

clk\_delay\_cycles is u32, so we may always set pdata->clk\_delay\_cycles as a

mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix race between runtime pm and irq
commit 3bb10f60933e84abfe2be69f60b3486f9b96348b upstream.
This patch is to fix a race condition that may cause an unhandled irq,
which results in big sdhci interrupt numbers and endless "mmc1: got irq
while runtime suspended" msgs before v3.15.
Consider following scenario:
CPU0 CPU1
sdhci\_pxav3\_runtime\_suspend()
spin\_lock\_irqsave(&host->lock, flags);
sdhci\_irq()
spining on the &host->lock
host->runtime\_suspended = true;
spin\_unlock\_irqrestore(&host->lock, flags);
get the &host->lock
runtime\_suspended is true now
return IRQ\_NONE;
Fix this race by using the core sdhci.c supplied sdhci\_runtime\_suspend\_host()
in runtime suspend hook which will disable card interrupts. We also use the
sdhci\_runtime\_resume\_host() in the runtime resume hook accordingly.

mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix unbalanced clock issues during probe
commit 62cf983ad84275f8580c807e5e596216c46773cf upstream.
Commit 0dcaa2499b7d ("sdhci-pxav3: Fix runtime PM initialization") tries
to fix one hang issue caused by calling sdhci\_add\_host() on a suspended
device. The fix enables the clock twice, once by clk\_prepare\_enable() and
another by pm\_runtime\_get\_sync(), meaning that the clock will never be
gated at runtime PM suspend. I observed the power consumption regression on
Marvell BG2Q SoCs.
In fact, the fix is not correct. There still be a very small window
during which a runtime suspend might somehow occur after pm\_runtime\_enable()
but before pm\_runtime\_get\_sync().
This patch fixes all of the two problems by just incrementing the usage
counter before pm\_runtime\_enable(). It also adjust the order of disabling
runtime pm and storing the usage count in the error path to handle clock
gating properly.

em28xx: fix em28xx-input removal
commit bbfebeea7640973613c484f0281bdd15d68fd873 upstream.
Removing the em28xx-rc module results in the following lockdep splat,
which is caused by trying to call cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync() on an
uninitialised delayed work. Fix this by ensuring we always initialise
the work.

rc-main: Re-apply filter for no-op protocol change
commit 983c5bd26b86ba1c0d79b770e596bb8b77e42f32 upstream.
Since commit da6e162d6a46 ("[media] rc-core: simplify sysfs code"), when
the IR protocol is set using the sysfs interface to the same set of
protocols that are already set, store\_protocols() does not refresh the
scancode filter with the new protocol, even if it has already called the
change\_protocol() callback successfully. This results in the filter
being disabled in the hardware and not re-enabled until the filter is
set again using sysfs.
Fix in store\_protocols() by still re-applying the filter whenever the
change\_protocol() driver callback succeeded.
The problem can be reproduced with the img-ir driver by setting a
filter, and then setting the protocol to the same protocol that is
already set:
$ echo nec > protocols
$ echo 0xffff > filter\_mask
$ echo nec > protocols
After this, messages which don't match the filter were still being
received.

megaraid\_sas: fix the problem of non-existing VD exposed to host
commit ab2f0608e16d64a23a2dcc8d83b966a0e0a281f3 upstream.
This patch will address the issue of SCSI device created at OS level for
non existing VD. ldTgtIdtoLd[] array has size 256 for Extended VD firmware
and 128 for legacy firmware. Accessing indices beyond array size (OS will
send TUR, INQUIRY.. commands upto device index 255), may return valid LD
value and that particular SCSI command will be SUCCESS and creating SCSI
device for non existing target(VD).
For legacy firmware (64 VD firmware), invalidates LD (by setting LD value
to 0xff) in LdTgtIdtoLd[] array for device index beyond 127, so that
invalid LD(0xff) value should be returned beyond device index beyond 127.

ALSA: off by one bug in snd\_riptide\_joystick\_probe()
commit e4940626defdf6c92da1052ad3f12741c1a28c90 upstream.
The problem here is that we check:
if (dev >= SNDRV\_CARDS)
Then we increment "dev".
if (!joystick\_port[dev++])
Then we use it as an offset into a array with SNDRV\_CARDS elements.
if (!request\_region(joystick\_port[dev], 8, "Riptide gameport")) {
This has 3 effects:
1) If you use the module option to specify the joystick port then it has
to be shifted one space over.
2) The wrong error message will be printed on failure if you have over
32 cards.
3) Static checkers will correctly complain that are off by one.

ACPI / LPSS: Always disable I2C host controllers
commit 3293c7b8ec213a640f5ea2e5efeaa2b7559b1e19 upstream.
On Baytrail and Braswell the BIOS might leave the I2C host controllers
enabled, probably because it uses them for its own purposes. This is fine
in normal cases because the I2C driver will disable the hardware when it
is probed anyway.
However, in case of suspend to disk it is different story. If the driver
happens to be compiled as a module the boot kernel never loads the driver
thus leaving host controllers enabled upon loading the hibernation image.
The I2C host controller interrupt mask register has default value of 0x8ff,
in other words it has most of the interrupts unmasked. When combined with
the fact that the host controller is enabled, the driver immediately starts
getting interrupts even before its resume hook is called (once IO-APIC is
resumed). Since the driver is not prepared for this it will crash the
kernel due to NULL pointer derefence because dev->msgs is NULL.
Unfortunately we were not able to get full backtrace to from the console
which could be reproduced here.
In order to fix this even when the driver is compiled as module, we disable
the I2C host controllers in byt\_i2c\_setup() before devices are created.

To avoid inconsistencies in the backend only work on a private copy

xen/manage: Fix USB interaction issues when resuming

Commit 61a734d305e1 ("xen/manage: Always freeze/thaw processes when

However, freeze\_processes() does not freeze kernel threads. Freeze
kernel threads as well to prevent deadlocks with the khubd thread when
resuming devices.
This is what native suspend and resume does.

cpufreq: speedstep-smi: enable interrupts when waiting
commit d4d4eda23794c701442e55129dd4f8f2fefd5e4d upstream.
On Dell Latitude C600 laptop with Pentium 3 850MHz processor, the
speedstep-smi driver sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't load with
"change to state X failed" message.
The hardware sometimes refuses to change frequency and in this case, we
need to retry later. I found out that we need to enable interrupts while
waiting. When we enable interrupts, the hardware blockage that prevents
frequency transition resolves and the transition is possible. With
disabled interrupts, the blockage doesn't resolve (no matter how long do
we wait). The exact reasons for this hardware behavior are unknown.
This patch enables interrupts in the function speedstep\_set\_state that can
be called with disabled interrupts. However, this function is called with
disabled interrupts only from speedstep\_get\_freqs, so it shouldn't cause
any problem.

cpufreq: Set cpufreq\_cpu\_data to NULL before putting kobject
commit 6ffae8c06fab058d6c3f8ecb7f921327721034e7 upstream.
In \_\_cpufreq\_remove\_dev\_finish(), per-cpu 'cpufreq\_cpu\_data' needs
to be cleared before calling kobject\_put(&policy->kobj) and under
cpufreq\_driver\_lock. Otherwise, if someone else calls cpufreq\_cpu\_get()
in parallel with it, they can obtain a non-NULL policy from that after
kobject\_put(&policy->kobj) was executed.
Consider this case:
Thread A Thread B
cpufreq\_cpu\_get()
acquire cpufreq\_driver\_lock
read-per-cpu cpufreq\_cpu\_data
kobject\_put(&policy->kobj);
kobject\_get(&policy->kobj);
...
per\_cpu(&cpufreq\_cpu\_data, cpu) = NULL
And this will result in a warning like this one:

The actual code flow is as follows:
Thread A: Workqueue: kacpi\_notify
acpi\_processor\_notify()
acpi\_processor\_ppc\_has\_changed()
cpufreq\_update\_policy()
cpufreq\_cpu\_get()

\_\_cpu\_notify(CPU\_POST\_DEAD..)
cpufreq\_cpu\_callback()
\_\_cpufreq\_remove\_dev\_finish()
cpufreq\_policy\_put\_kobj()
kobject\_put()
cpufreq\_cpu\_get() gets the policy from per-cpu variable cpufreq\_cpu\_data
under cpufreq\_driver\_lock, and once it gets a valid policy it expects it
to not be freed until cpufreq\_cpu\_put() is called.
But the race happens when another thread puts the kobject first and updates
cpufreq\_cpu\_data before or later. And so the first thread gets a valid policy
structure and before it does kobject\_get() on it, the second one has already
done kobject\_put().
Fix this by setting cpufreq\_cpu\_data to NULL before putting the kobject and that
too under locks.

ASoC: davinci: fix DM365\_EVM codec selection
commit f9a7ba326938f03b9305af8d31c360fce10cd4df upstream.
An earlier bug fix of mine made the SND\_DM365\_VOICE\_CODEC symbol
tristate to avoid creating an undefined reference from the
davinci-vcif.c driver to the davinci\_soc\_platform\_register
function that may be in a module.
However, this may now lead to a different error on randconfig
kernels:
"warning: SND\_DM365\_VOICE\_CODEC creates inconsistent choice state"
This happens because we now have a choice statement with
one bool and one tristate option, and the latter might not
support being set to 'y' because of dependencies.
This new change turns the other option into 'tristate' as well,
which avoids the problem.

ASoC: rt5677: fix SPI dependency

The rt5677 codec has gained code that requires SPI to work correctly,
but there is no provision in Kconfig to prevent the driver from
being used when SPI is disabled or a loadable module, resulting
in this build error:
sound/built-in.o: In function `rt5677\_spi\_write':
:(.text+0xa7ba0): undefined reference to `spi\_sync'
sound/built-in.o: In function `rt5677\_spi\_driver\_init':

ERROR: "spi\_register\_driver" [sound/soc/codecs/snd-soc-rt5677-spi.ko] undefined!
This makes the SPI portion of the driver depend on the SPI subsystem,
and disables the function that uses SPI for firmware download if SPI
is disabled. The latter may not be the correct solution, but I could
not come up with a better one.

commit 279e17ae81c17b40ae7a6c9e10f386a7aac7aa55 upstream.
Function sst\_acpi\_probe() uses plain strcpy for setting member firmware\_name
of a struct intel\_sst\_drv from member firmware of a struct sst\_machines.
Thereby the destination array has got a length of 20 byte while the source may
hold 32 byte. Since eg. commit 64b9c90b8600 ("ASoC: Intel: Fix BYTCR firmware
name") increased strings from "fw\_sst\_0f28.bin" to "intel/fw\_sst\_0f28.bin"
there is an actual possibility that the 20 byte array at the end of struct
intel\_sst\_drv is overrun.
Thus increase the size of the destination and use the same define for both
structs. Detected by Coverity CID 1260087.

PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias var in uevent
commit 145b3fe579db66fbe999a2bc3fd5b63dffe9636d upstream.
Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
r3.0, Appendix D. Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
alpha characters, so they won't be affected. For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
20h, etc. are unaffected.
Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.
Commit 89ec3dcf17fd ("PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface
class") fixed only half of the problem. Some udev implementations rely on
the uevent file and not the modalias file.

We don't really need to use different mac colors when adding mac

iwlwifi: pcie: disable the SCD\_BASE\_ADDR when we resume from WoWLAN
commit cd8f438405032ac8ff88bd8f2eca5e0c0063b14b upstream.
The base address of the scheduler in the device's memory
(SRAM) comes from two different sources. The periphery
register and the alive notification from the firmware.
We have a check in iwl\_pcie\_tx\_start that ensures that
they are the same.
When we resume from WoWLAN, the firmware may have crashed
for whatever reason. In that case, the whole device may be
reset which means that the periphery register will hold a
meaningless value. When we come to compare
trans\_pcie->scd\_base\_addr (which really holds the value we
had when we loaded the WoWLAN firmware upon suspend) and
the current value of the register, we don't see a match
unsurprisingly.
Trick the check to avoid a loud yet harmless WARN.
Note that when the WoWLAN has crashed, we will see that
in iwl\_trans\_pcie\_d3\_resume which will let the op\_mode
know. Once the op\_mode is informed that the WowLAN firmware
has crashed, it can't do much besides resetting the whole
device.

ksoftirqd: Enable IRQs and call cond\_resched() before poking RCU
commit 28423ad283d5348793b0c45cc9b1af058e776fd6 upstream.
While debugging an issue with excessive softirq usage, I encountered the
following note in commit 3e339b5dae24a706 ("softirq: Use hotplug thread
infrastructure"):
[ paulmck: Call rcu\_note\_context\_switch() with interrupts enabled. ]
...but despite this note, the patch still calls RCU with IRQs disabled.
This seemingly innocuous change caused a significant regression in softirq
CPU usage on the sending side of a large TCP transfer (~1 GB/s): when
introducing 0.01% packet loss, the softirq usage would jump to around 25%,
spiking as high as 50%. Before the change, the usage would never exceed 5%.
Moving the call to rcu\_note\_context\_switch() after the cond\_sched() call,
as it was originally before the hotplug patch, completely eliminated this
problem.

fsnotify: fix handling of renames in audit
commit 6ee8e25fc3e916193bce4ebb43d5439e1e2144ab upstream.
Commit e9fd702a58c4 ("audit: convert audit watches to use fsnotify
instead of inotify") broke handling of renames in audit. Audit code
wants to update inode number of an inode corresponding to watched name
in a directory. When something gets renamed into a directory to a
watched name, inotify previously passed moved inode to audit code
however new fsnotify code passes directory inode where the change
happened. That confuses audit and it starts watching parent directory
instead of a file in a directory.
This can be observed for example by doing:
cd /tmp
touch foo bar
auditctl -w /tmp/foo
touch foo
mv bar foo
touch foo
In audit log we see events like:
type=CONFIG\_CHANGE msg=audit(1423563584.155:90): auid=1000 ses=2 op="updated rules" path="/tmp/foo" key=(null) list=4 res=1
...
type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=2 name="bar" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=3 name="foo" inode=1046842 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=4 name="foo" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=CREATE
...
and that's it - we see event for the first touch after creating the
audit rule, we see events for rename but we don't see any event for the
last touch. However we start seeing events for unrelated stuff
happening in /tmp.
Fix the problem by passing moved inode as data in the FS\_MOVED\_FROM and
FS\_MOVED\_TO events instead of the directory where the change happens.
This doesn't introduce any new problems because noone besides
audit\_watch.c cares about the passed value:
fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c cares only about FSNOTIFY\_EVENT\_PATH events.
fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c doesn't care about passed 'data' value at all.
fs/notify/inotify/inotify\_fsnotify.c uses 'data' only for FSNOTIFY\_EVENT\_PATH.
kernel/audit\_tree.c doesn't care about passed 'data' at all.
kernel/audit\_watch.c expects moved inode as 'data'.

xfs: only trace buffer items if they exist
commit e9892d3cc853afdda2cc69e2576d9ddb5fafad71 upstream.
The commit 2d3d0c5 ("xfs: lobotomise xfs\_trans\_read\_buf\_map()") left
a landmine in the tracing code: trace\_xfs\_trans\_buf\_read() is now
call on all buffers that are read through this interface rather than
just buffers in transactions. For buffers outside transaction
context, bp->b\_fspriv is null, and so the buf log item tracing
functions cannot be called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference
in the trace\_xfs\_trans\_buf\_read() function when tracing is turned
on.

xfs: set superblock buffer type correctly
commit 3443a3bca54588f43286b725d8648d33a38c86f1 upstream.
When the superblock is modified in a transaction, the commonly
modified fields are not actually copied to the superblock buffer to
avoid the buffer lock becoming a serialisation point. However, there
are some other operations that modify the superblock fields within
the transaction that don't directly log to the superblock but rely
on the changes to be applied during the transaction commit (to
minimise the buffer lock hold time).
When we do this, we fail to mark the buffer log item as being a
superblock buffer and that can lead to the buffer not being marked
with the corect type in the log and hence causing recovery issues.
Fix it by setting the type correctly, similar to xfs\_mod\_sb()...

commit fe22d552b82d7cc7de1851233ae8bef579198637 upstream.
Conversion from local to extent format does not set the buffer type
correctly on the new extent buffer when a symlink data is moved out
of line.
Fix the symlink code and leave a comment in the generic bmap code
reminding us that the format-specific data copy needs to set the
destination buffer type appropriately.

xfs: ensure buffer types are set correctly
commit 0d612fb570b71ea2e49554a770cff4c489018b2c upstream.
Jan Kara reported that log recovery was finding buffers with invalid
types in them. This should not happen, and indicates a bug in the
logging of buffers. To catch this, add asserts to the buffer
formatting code to ensure that the buffer type is in range when the
transaction is committed.
We don't set a type on buffers being marked stale - they are not
going to get replayed, the format item exists only for recovery to
be able to prevent replay of the buffer, so the type does not
matter. Hence that needs special casing here.

random: Fix fast\_mix() function
commit 19acc77a36970958a4a0e4daeb2c8cb2aab0ffd4 upstream.
There was a bad typo in commit 43759d4f429c ("random: use an improved
fast\_mix() function") and I didn't notice because it "looked right", so
I saw what I expected to see when I reviewed it.
Only months later did I look and notice it's not the Threefish-inspired
mix function that I had designed and optimized.
Mea Culpa. Each input bit still has a chance to affect each output bit,
and the fast pool is spilled \*long\* before it fills, so it's not a total
disaster, but it's definitely not the intended great improvement.
I'm still working on finding better rotation constants. These are good
enough, but since it's unrolled twice, it's possible to get better
mixing for free by using eight different constants rather than repeating
the same four.

In addition the Synchronization Train Received event is actually broken
on this controller. It mixes up the order of parameters. According to the
Bluetooth Core specification the fields are like this:
struct hci\_ev\_sync\_train\_received {
\_\_u8 status;
bdaddr\_t bdaddr;
\_\_le32 offset;
\_\_u8 map[10];
\_\_u8 lt\_addr;
\_\_le32 instant;
\_\_le16 interval;
\_\_u8 service\_data;
} \_\_packed;
This controller however sends the service\_data as 5th parameter instead
of having it as last parameter.
struct hci\_ev\_sync\_train\_received {
\_\_u8 status;
bdaddr\_t bdaddr;
\_\_le32 offset;
\_\_u8 map[10];
\_\_u8 service\_data;
\_\_u8 lt\_addr;
\_\_le32 instant;
\_\_le16 interval;
} \_\_packed;
So anybody trying to use this hardware for utilizing connectionless slave
broadcast receivers (aka 3D Glasses), be warned about this shortcoming.

Firmware is extracted from the latest Broadcom BCM4352 Windows driver
by extracting the zip and searching the .hex file names for '17cf'.
The hex file must then be converted to hcd format using the hex2hcd
utility and then moved to /lib/firmware/brcm/.

Bluetooth: Fix valid Identity Address check
commit e12af489b91d47a806f4e96e4edc20df612482e7 upstream.
According to the Bluetooth core specification valid identity addresses
are either Public Device Addresses or Static Random Addresses. IRKs
received with any other type of address should be discarded since we
cannot assume to know the permanent identity of the peer device.
This patch fixes a missing check for the Identity Address when receiving
the Identity Address Information SMP PDU.

Bluetooth: ath3k: workaround the compatibility issue with xHCI controller
commit c561a5753dd631920c4459a067d22679b3d110d6 upstream.
BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1400215
ath3k devices fail to load firmwares on xHCI buses, but work well on
EHCI, this might be a compatibility issue between xHCI and ath3k chips.
As my testing result, those chips will work on xHCI buses again with
this patch.
This workaround is from Qualcomm, they also did some workarounds in
Windows driver.

ext4: ignore journal checksum on remount; don't fail
commit 2d5b86e048780c5efa7f7d9708815555919e7b05 upstream.
As of v3.18, ext4 started rejecting a remount which changes the
journal\_checksum option.
Prior to that, it was simply ignored; the problem here is that
if someone has this in their fstab for the root fs, now the box
fails to boot properly, because remount of root with the new options
will fail, and the box proceeds with a readonly root.
I think it is a little nicer behavior to accept the option, but
warn that it's being ignored, rather than failing the mount,
but that might be a subjective matter...

# RHSA-2015:1221 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1221)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's

virtual console implementation handled reference counting when accessing
pseudo-terminal device files (/dev/pts/\*). A local, unprivileged attacker
could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2011-5321, Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not

properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could
lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user
able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system.
On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping
sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-3636, Moderate)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized

the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as
x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,
Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation

implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.
A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges
on the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation

for IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the
default one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent
systems on that network from sending or receiving network packets.
(CVE-2015-2922, Low)

These updated kernel packages also include numerous bug fixes and one
enhancement. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
advisory. For information on the most significant of these changes, users
are directed to the following article on the Red Hat Customer Portal:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/1506133>

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1138)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG
2.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read

and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were
already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,
potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array
overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system
or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,
Important)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys

management subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker
could attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which
would cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation

implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.
A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges
on the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's ISO file system implementation did

not correctly limit the traversal of Rock Ridge extension Continuation
Entries (CE). An attacker with physical access to the system could use this
flaw to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2014-9420, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ISO9660

file system implementation accessed data on an ISO9660 image with RockRidge
Extension Reference (ER) records. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to disclose up to 255 bytes of kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-9584, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the nft\_flush\_table() function of the Linux

kernel's netfilter tables implementation flushed rules that were
referencing deleted chains. A local user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN
capability could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2015-1573, Low)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized

the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as
x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,
Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Carl Henrik Lunde for reporting CVE-2014-9420
and CVE-2014-9584. The security impact of CVE-2015-1805 was discovered by
Red Hat.

This update provides a build of the kernel-rt package for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.5 that is layered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and
fixes the following issues:

* storvsc: get rid of overly verbose warning messages
* storvsc: force discovery of LUNs that may have been removed
* storvsc: in responce to a scan event, scan the hos
* storvsc: NULL pointer dereference fix
* futex: Mention key referencing differences between shared and private

futexes

* futex: Ensure get\_futex\_key\_refs() always implies a barrier
* kernel module: set nx before marking module MODULE\_STATE\_COMING
* kernel module: Clean up ro/nx after early module load failures
* btrfs: make xattr replace operations atomic
* megaraid\_sas: revert: Add release date and update driver version
* radeon: fix kernel segfault in hwmonitor

(BZ#1223077)

Bug fix:

* There is an XFS optimization that depended on a spinlock to disable

preemption using the preempt\_disable() function. When CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_RT is
enabled on realtime kernels, spinlocks do not disable preemption while
held, so the XFS critical section was not protected from preemption.
Systems on the Realtime kernel-rt could lock up in this XFS optimization
when a task that locked all the counters was then preempted by a realtime
task, causing all callers of that lock to block indefinitely. This update
disables the optimization when building a kernel with
CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_RT\_FULL enabled. (BZ#1217849)

All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# CVE-2014-9584

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-9568.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-9585.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-9584 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9584)

#### Description

The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not validate a length value in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [912654](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=912654) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# CVE-2014-9585

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-9584.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-9587.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-9585 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9585)

#### Description

The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18.2 does not properly choose memory locations for the vDSO area, which makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a PMD.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [912705](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=912705) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=909078#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-12-09 16:42:18 UTC  ``` [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1400314](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1400314)  paravirt_enabled has the following effects:   - Disables the F00F bug workaround warning. There is no F00F bug workaround any more because Linux's standard IDT handling already works around the F00F bug, but the warning still exists. This is only cosmetic, and, in any event, there is no such thing as KVM on a CPU with the F00F bug.   - Disables 32-bit APM BIOS detection. On a KVM paravirt system, there should be no APM BIOS anyway. - Disables tboot. I think that the tboot code should check the CPUID hypervisor bit directly if it matters.   - paravirt_enabled disables espfix32. espfix32 should *not* be disabled under KVM paravirt. The last point is the purpose of this patch. It fixes a leak of the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit KVM paravirt guests. While I'm at it, this removes pv_info setup from kvmclock. That code seems to serve no purpose.  CVE-2014-8134 was assigned to this issue. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=909078#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-12-09 23:00:33 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=909078#c2)  Jiri Kosina   2014-12-10 09:56:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexander Bergmann from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=909078#c0)) [ ... snip ... ] > under KVM paravirt.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's scsi

subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4036](/security/CVE-2015-4036))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1137)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read

and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were
already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,
potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array
overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system
or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,
Important)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys

management subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker
could attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which
would cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation

implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.
A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges
on the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's ISO file system implementation did

not correctly limit the traversal of Rock Ridge extension Continuation
Entries (CE). An attacker with physical access to the system could use this
flaw to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2014-9420, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ISO9660

file system implementation accessed data on an ISO9660 image with RockRidge
Extension Reference (ER) records. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to disclose up to 255 bytes of kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-9584, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the nft\_flush\_table() function of the Linux

kernel's netfilter tables implementation flushed rules that were
referencing deleted chains. A local user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN
capability could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2015-1573, Low)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized

the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as
x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,
Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Carl Henrik Lunde for reporting CVE-2014-9420
and CVE-2014-9584. The security impact of the CVE-2015-1805 issue was
discovered by Red Hat.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes is
available from the following Knowledgebase article:
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/1469163>

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Extension 11 SP3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 21 vulnerabilities and has 69 fixes
is now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3 Realtime kernel was updated to receive
various security and bugfixes.
The following security bugs have been fixed:
\*
CVE-2015-1593: An integer overflow in the stack randomization on
64-bit systems lead to less effective stack ASLR on those systems.
(bsc#917839)
\*
CVE-2014-8160: iptables rules could be bypassed if the specific
network protocol module was not loaded, allowing e.g. SCTP to bypass the
firewall if the sctp protocol was not enabled. (bsc#913059)
\*
CVE-2014-7822: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels
splice() system call validated its parameters. On certain file systems, a
local, unprivileged user could have used this flaw to write past the
maximum file size, and thus crash the system. (bnc#915322)
\*
CVE-2014-9419: The \_\_switch\_to function in
arch/x86/kernel/process\_64.c in the Linux kernel did not ensure that
Thread Local Storage (TLS) descriptors are loaded before proceeding with
other steps, which made it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR
protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a TLS base
address (bnc#911326).
\*
CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel did not validate a length value in the
Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660
image (bnc#912654).
\*
CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly choose memory locations for the vDSO area,
which made it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection
mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a PMD (bnc#912705).
\*
CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux
kernel did not properly maintain the semantics of rename\_lock, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang) via a crafted application (bnc#903640).
\*
CVE-2014-9420: The rock\_continue function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel did not restrict the number of Rock Ridge continuation
entries, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (infinite
loop, and system crash or hang) via a crafted iso9660 image (bsc#911325).
\*
CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in
arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel used an improper
paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which made it easier for
guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted
application that reads a 16-bit value (bnc#907818 909077 909078).
\*
CVE-2014-8369: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel miscalculated the number of pages during the handling
of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of
service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact
by leveraging guest OS privileges. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3601 (bsc#902675).
\*
CVE-2014-3690: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux
kernel on Intel processors did not ensure that the value in the CR4
control register remains the same after a VM entry, which allowed host OS
users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a denial of service (system
disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access, as demonstrated by PR\_SET\_TSC
prctl calls within a modified copy of QEMU (bnc#902232).
\*
CVE-2014-7842: Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
kernel allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS
crash) via a crafted application that performs an MMIO transaction or a
PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace emulation error report, a
similar issue to CVE-2010-5313 (bnc#905312).
\*
CVE-2014-0181: The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel did
not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the
opener of a socket, which allowed local users to bypass intended
access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink
socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program (bnc#875051).
\*
CVE-2014-3688: The SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel allowed
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by
triggering a large number of chunks in an associations output queue, as
demonstrated by ASCONF probes, related to net/sctp/inqueue.c and
net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902351).
\*
CVE-2014-7970: The pivot\_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly interact with certain locations of a
chroot directory, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot\_root
system call (bnc#900644).
\*
CVE-2014-3687: The sctp\_assoc\_lookup\_asconf\_ack function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via
duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork within the
side-effect interpreter (bnc#902349 904899).

| CVE: | CVE-2015-1593 |
| BUG: | Linux stack ASLR implementation Integer overflow |
| Dates: | 7 January 2015 - Public disclosure |

## Description

A bug in **Linux ASLR implementation** for versions prior to 3.19-rc3 has
been found. The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly
randomized on some 64 bit architectures due to an **integer overflow**.

**Affected systems have reduced the stack entropy of the processes by four.** To check if
your Linux is vulnerable simply execute the following:

```

$ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
7fff612ab000-7fff612cc000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff7df8d000-7fff7dfae000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff9b738000-7fff9b759000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff915db000-7fff915fc000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fffa4111000-7fffa4132000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff1f272000-7fff1f293000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fffa5831000-7fffa5852000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff10ac5000-7fff10ae6000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fffeb039000-7fffeb05a000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff807b6000-7fff807d7000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]

```

If you see in your system the sequence
7FFF
then your system is not patched and your ASLR is slightly weaker. The previous example shows that
this **x86\_64 architecture is vulnerable**.

For completeness: The total amount of stack entropy is not shown by
printing the memory map because most Linux architectures implement an
intra-page randomization which increases the stack entropy by one more
byte. Therefore, the real stack entropy is given by 7FFF???????0, which is 2^28 in affected systems.

A system not affected by this weakness shall have a total stack
entropy of 230, that is four times more entropy.

```

$ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffdb59f6000-7ffdb5a17000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffcc20d4000-7ffcc20f5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7fff3d799000-7fff3d7ba000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffe9ddf9000-7ffe9de1a000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffeda006000-7ffeda027000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
7ffeef21f000-7ffeef240000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]

```

The upper two bytes in non-affected systems should cover the range from
7FFC
to 7FFD.

## Impact

The total stack entropy of the processes is reduced by four: from
230 to 228 (One fourth of expected entropy). The
possible locations are significantly reduced from around one billion to
two hundred millions. The problem seems to affect only to the x86\_64
architecture.

## Affected Linux versions

All Linux versions prior to 3.19-rc3 are affected. As far as we know
this bug is already present in the first commit (1da177e) on the
current repository (https://github.com/torvalds/linux), April 2005.

## The bug

The bug appears because the presence of a **integer overflow** in
the function which **randomizes the stack**: randomize\_stack\_top() in file
"fs/binfmt\_elf.c" (the line containing the error is highlighted in red):
```

static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
{
        unsigned int random_variable = 0;

        if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
        }
#ifdef CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP
        return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
#else
        return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
#endif
}

```

The "random\_variable" variable is declared as "unsigned int".
Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK\_RND\_MASK (which is
0x3FFFFF on x86\_64, 22 bits) and PAGE\_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86\_64),
then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
"random\_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold the
(22+12) result.

The previous integer overflow could cause intermittent crashed due to
an incorrect stack GAP calculation. But a second bug on the stack\_maxrandom\_size() function, which also
suffers an integer overflow, the value calculated on the former function
(although it is wrong) matches with the real max stack value. The second
affected function is in file "arch/x86/mm/mmap.c":

```

static unsigned int stack_maxrandom_size(void)
{
   unsigned int max = 0;
   if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
      !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
      max = ((-1U) & STACK_RND_MASK) << PAGE_SHIFT;
   }

   return max;
}

```

## Exploit

It is not necessary to do anything to exploit this issue. Every launched
application in the system using the ASLR will be affected by this issue.

Any attempt to guess where the stack is mapped, for example by using
brute force or trial and test attacks, requires four times less trials
(i.e. are faster).

## FIX

We have created a patch which restores back the entropy by correcting
the types involved in the operations in the functions
randomize\_stack\_top() and stack\_maxrandom\_size().

## Discussion

Although only two bits are dropped due to an integer overflow, note that
from 230 to 228 the stack entropy is reduced by four. In short,
an attacker will need to perform 4 times less work to guess where the
stack is placed. The number of possible places to allocate the stack due
to integer overflow is approximately 268 millions instead of 1 billion.
Maybe for this reason this bug has remained hidden for so long.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

It occurs due to incorrect usage of file system locks.  An unprivileged user/process could use this flaw to render the system unusable, thus resulting in DoS.  Upstream: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/25/179>  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1159313> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/30/7> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c1)  Jiri Slaby   2015-01-12 09:18:10 UTC  ``` Any updates here?  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.stable/119766> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c2)  Forgotten User sLJ7K2dvxj   2015-01-14 09:25:37 UTC  ``` Workin on the backport... ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c3)  Forgotten User sLJ7K2dvxj   2015-01-14 16:32:21 UTC  ``` The first patch (946e51f2bf37 "move d_rcu from overlapping d_child to overlapping d_alias") will make the kabi checker complain, since the d_rcu field in struct dentry is moved from being a union with d_child to being a union with d_alias.  I think we can just revert the actual move of d_rcu for the kabi generator, since nobody outside fs/dcache.c should ever be using d_rcu directly, and the other fields remain at the same position and size (struct rcu_head is two pointers, just like struct list_head and struct hlist_node).  But I'm not sure this sort of trickery is allowed.  Michal? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c4)  Michal Marek   2015-01-14 16:55:08 UTC  ``` Can you please bring it up on the kernel mailing list. At first look I would say no, because it's not just the union change, but also the layout and size of struct dentry. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c5)  Forgotten User sLJ7K2dvxj   2015-01-21 16:11:19 UTC  ``` Fixes pushed to:  SLE11-SP3 SLE12 openSUSE-13.1 openSUSE-13.2  Over to -security. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=903640#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-01-30 10:09:30 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:0178-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 59 fixes is now available.

# USN-2561-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

8 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not

properly sanitize its input parameters while registering memory regions

from userspace. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or to potentially gain administrative privileges.

([CVE-2014-8159](/security/CVE-2014-8159))

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1462-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1462.82](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1462.82)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

With the new cgroupv2 the access to devices is controller by BPF programs.  In libvirt we need to create new program for every VM and attach it to appropriate cgroup.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-4.18.0-47.el8.src.rpm   How reproducible: Not always which indicates that it's most likely some race-condition.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. boot OS with 'systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1' on the kernel command line 2. install qemu-kvm package (for that you need to enable AppStream repository) 3. download attached test program 4. compile using gcc/clang 5. set 'ulimit -l unlimited' in order to successfully run test program 5. run attached program multiple times 6. use 'bpftool prog list' to list all BPF programs, you will see that there are existing "cgroup_device" programs that are no longer assigned to any existing cgroup 7. in the root cgroup you can check   Actual results: there are BPF programs left in the system that are not freed/removed  Expected results: all programs should be freed   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1656432#c3)  Jiri Olsa    2019-04-01 16:00:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pavel Hrdina from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1656432#c0)) > Created [attachment 1511682](attachment.cgi?id=1511682 "reproduce test program") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1511682&action=edit "reproduce test program") > reproduce test program >  > Description of problem: >  > In libvirt we are using cgroups to limit resources available to QEMU > processes and on of the resources is access to devices.

I've tried newer kernel that is shipped in Fedora 29, it's 5.0.5 version, if I try the test-bpf all BPF programs are correctly freed, but if I start VM 100 times there is always only one BPF program left, which is weird.

An update that solves 11 vulnerabilities and has 5 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The Linux kernel was updated to fix various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2014-8173: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the
Linux kernels madvise MADV\_WILLNEED functionality handled page table
locking. A local, unprivileged user could have used this flaw to crash
the system.
- CVE-2015-1593: A integer overflow reduced the effectiveness of the stack
randomization on 64-bit systems.
- CVE-2014-7822: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels splice()
system call validated its parameters. On certain file systems, a local,
unprivileged user could have used this flaw to write past the maximum
file size, and thus crash the system.
- CVE-2014-9419: The \_\_switch\_to function in arch/x86/kernel/process\_64.c
in the Linux kernel did not ensure that Thread Local Storage (TLS)
descriptors are loaded before proceeding with other steps, which made it
easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a
crafted application that reads a TLS base address.
- CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c
in the Linux kernel used an improper paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM
guest kernels, which made it easier for guest OS users to bypass the
ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit
value.
- CVE-2014-8160: net/netfilter/nf\_conntrack\_proto\_generic.c in the Linux
kernel generated incorrect conntrack entries during handling of certain
iptables rule sets for the SCTP, DCCP, GRE, and UDP-Lite protocols,
which allowed remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
via packets with disallowed port numbers.
- CVE-2014-9529: Race condition in the key\_gc\_unused\_keys function in
security/keys/gc.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via keyctl commands that trigger access to a
key structure member during garbage collection of a key.
- CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux kernel
through did not properly maintain the semantics of rename\_lock, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang) via a crafted application.
- CVE-2014-9420: The rock\_continue function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel did not restrict the number of Rock Ridge continuation
entries, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop, and system crash or hang) via a crafted iso9660 image.
- CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel did not validate a length value in
the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted
iso9660 image.
- CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly choose memory locations for the vDSO area,
which made it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection
mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a PMD.
Following bugs were fixed:
- HID: usbhid: enable always-poll quirk for Elan Touchscreen 0103
(bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: enable always-poll quirk for Elan Touchscreen 016f
(bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: enable always-poll quirk for Elan Touchscreen 009b
(bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: add another mouse that needs QUIRK\_ALWAYS\_POLL (bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: fix PIXART optical mouse (bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: enable always-poll quirk for Elan Touchscreen (bnc#920901).
- HID: usbhid: add always-poll quirk (bnc#920901).
- storvsc: ring buffer failures may result in I/O freeze (bnc#914175).
- mm, vmscan: prevent kswapd livelock due to pfmemalloc-throttled process
being killed (VM Functionality bnc#910150).
- Input: evdev - fix EVIOCG{type} ioctl (bnc#904899).
- mnt: Implicitly add MNT\_NODEV on remount when it was implicitly added by
mount (bsc#907988).
- DocBook: Do not exceed argument list limit.
- DocBook: Make mandocs parallel-safe.
- mm: free compound page with correct order (bnc#913695).
- udf: Check component length before reading it.
- udf: Check path length when reading symlink.
- udf: Verify symlink size before loading it.
- udf: Verify i\_size when loading inode.
- xfs: remote attribute overwrite causes transaction overrun.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1072204](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1072204) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1115893](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1115893) [NEW], [912202](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=912202) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-13 15:42:47 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that stack address is not properly randomized on some 64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow. The stack entropy of the processes is reduced by four. The possible locations are significantly reduced from around one billion to two hundred millions. The problem seems to affect only to the x86_64 architecture. Proposed patch: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/7/811>  [1]: <http://hmarco.org/bugs/linux-ASLR-integer-overflow.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-13 15:43:09 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1192520](show_bug.cgi?id=1192520 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-1593 kernel: Linux stack ASLR implementation Integer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1192519#c2)  Petr Matousek    2015-02-20 13:49:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affect the Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates in the respective releases may address this issue.  This issue does affect the Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

## Details

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP

(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

([CVE-2015-1421](/security/CVE-2015-1421))

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets

to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker on the same subnet can exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-1465](/security/CVE-2015-1465))

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1750813#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-09-10 14:05:41 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in the Linux kernels network tun/tap device creation. An attacker with local account can issue an ioctl to a device which can cause a small memory leak which can not be reclaimed.  Each time this attack is repeated additional memory is leaked and this may eventually consume all memory in the system causing a denial of service DOS.

x86, mm/ASLR: Fix stack randomization on 64-bit systems

```
The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly randomized on
64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.

The affected function is randomize_stack_top() in file
"fs/binfmt_elf.c":

  static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
  {
           unsigned int random_variable = 0;

           if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                   !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                   random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                   random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
           }
           return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
           return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
  }

Note that, it declares the "random_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK_RND_MASK (which
is 0x3fffff on x86_64, 22 bits) and PAGE_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86_64):

	  random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;

then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
"random_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
the (22+12) result.

These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).

This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
in the operations in the functions randomize_stack_top() and
stack_maxrandom_size().

The successful fix can be tested with:

  $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
  7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
  7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
  7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
  7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
  ...

Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
rather than always being 7fff.

# CVE-2015-1593

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1573.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1606.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1593 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1593)

#### Description

The stack randomization feature in the Linux kernel before 3.19.1 on 64-bit platforms uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by predicting the address of the top of the stack, related to the randomize\_stack\_top function in fs/binfmt\_elf.c and the stack\_maxrandom\_size function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue does not affect SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 products or older, as the patch reducing the randomness is not present. The issue was fixed for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 in the 3.12.39 stable kernel update.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1044934](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1044934) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [917839](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=917839) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's scsi

subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4036](/security/CVE-2015-4036))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
