Here's the analysis of CVE-2015-1593 based on the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow occurs in the Linux kernel's stack randomization feature on 64-bit platforms. Specifically, the `randomize_stack_top()` function in `fs/binfmt_elf.c` and the `stack_maxrandom_size()` function in `arch/x86/mm/mmap.c` use incorrect data types for bitwise left-shift operations. This leads to a loss of entropy when randomizing stack addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow**: The use of `unsigned int` instead of a larger type like `unsigned long` to store a calculation that is greater than `unsigned int` can handle, resulting in loss of entropy.
*   **Insufficient ASLR**: Stack address randomization is limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy for the initial stack in 64-bit processes. This makes the stack address easier to predict and bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Reduced ASLR Effectiveness**: An attacker can more easily predict the address of the top of the stack due to the limited randomization, which makes it easier to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection. This exposes the system to exploits that rely on knowing the stack address.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User Access**: An unprivileged user with the ability to execute code on a vulnerable system can potentially exploit the vulnerability.
*  **64-bit architecture**: Vulnerability impacts 64-bit systems, particularly x86-64 architectures.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Several sources mention that this issue leads to reducing stack entropy by four bits, causing the stack addresses to be predictable.
*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions before 3.19.1.
*   Patches and fixes are widely available from multiple Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, and Red Hat.
*   Red Hat has classified this issue as having "Low" to "Moderate" severity depending on the specific product.
*   A patch for this vulnerability has been merged upstream into the kernel source code.
*   The bug was present from the first commit of the file in the linux repository.
*   The affected code is in the `randomize_stack_top` function which deals with how stack addresses are chosen by the system.
