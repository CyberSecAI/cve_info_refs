{
  "CVE-2015-1867": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way pacemaker, a cluster resource manager, evaluated added nodes in certain situations. A user with read-only access could potentially assign any other existing roles to themselves and then add privileges to other users as well.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from improper enforcement of access control list (ACL) definitions within Pacemaker. Specifically, a user with read-only access to the Cluster Information Base (CIB) could bypass the ACL restrictions and assign themselves roles that should require write access. This allowed the read-only user to effectively gain write access.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insufficient access control enforcement",
      "Bypassing read-only restrictions",
       "Unintended role assignment capabilities"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A user with read-only access can escalate their privileges by assigning themselves administrative or other high-privilege roles. This allows the attacker to perform actions they should not be authorized for, such as modifying the CIB, potentially leading to disruption of cluster services.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the `pcs` command-line tool used to manage the Pacemaker cluster, utilizing the cluster's ACL system. An attacker must have read-only access to the CIB, which could be achieved through compromised accounts or other means.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Read-only access to the cluster's CIB",
      "Access to the `pcs` command-line tool"
     ]
  }
