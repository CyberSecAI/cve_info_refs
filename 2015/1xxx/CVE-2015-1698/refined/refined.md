Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Windows Journal parses Journal files. Specifically, a specially crafted Journal file can trigger remote code execution when opened by a user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper parsing of Journal files by Windows Journal.
- This leads to a remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system.
- This can lead to the installation of programs, viewing, changing or deletion of data, or creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send a specially crafted Journal (.jnt) file to a user.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens the malicious .jnt file using the vulnerable version of Windows Journal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious .jnt file to a target user.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious .jnt file using Windows Journal.
