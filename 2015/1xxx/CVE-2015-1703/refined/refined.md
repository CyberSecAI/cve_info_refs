The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-043, including CVE-2015-1703.

**CVE-2015-1703:**

*   **Root Cause:** An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under certain conditions. This can potentially allow a script to be run with elevated privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper permission validation within Internet Explorer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could elevate privileges within the affected version of Internet Explorer. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, but could be combined with another vulnerability (like a remote code execution) to allow arbitrary code to run with the permissions of the current user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could host a website or leverage compromised websites with specially crafted content to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content, for instance, by clicking on a link.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website or control content on a website that a user visits and must convince the user to interact with this malicious content.

The document also includes information on other vulnerabilities fixed in the same bulletin:

*   **CVE-2015-1684:** VBScript ASLR bypass, allowing attackers to bypass ASLR and more reliably predict the memory offsets, which could be used with another vulnerability to execute code.
*   **CVE-2015-1686:** JScript and VBScript ASLR bypass, similar to CVE-2015-1684.
*  **CVE-2015-1685:** Internet Explorer ASLR bypass, similar to the above ASLR bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **CVE-2015-1688, CVE-2015-1704, CVE-2015-1713:** Other elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, similar to CVE-2015-1703.
*   **CVE-2015-1692:** Internet Explorer clipboard information disclosure, allowing a malicious website to potentially access the user's clipboard content.
*   **Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-1658, CVE-2015-1689, CVE-2015-1691, CVE-2015-1694, CVE-2015-1705, CVE-2015-1706, CVE-2015-1708, CVE-2015-1709, CVE-2015-1710, CVE-2015-1711, CVE-2015-1712, CVE-2015-1714, CVE-2015-1717, CVE-2015-1718):** Remote code execution vulnerabilities caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The document also provides workarounds for the ASLR bypass and clipboard vulnerabilities and mitigations, such as Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers and the use of EMET.
