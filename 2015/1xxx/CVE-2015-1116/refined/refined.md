*   **CVE-ID:** CVE-2015-1116 : The mobile app team at HP Security Voltage, Aaron Rogers of Mint.com, David Edwards of Tech4Tomorrow, David Zhang of Dropbox

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The UIKit framework did not properly blur application snapshots that contained sensitive data when displayed in the Task Switcher.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to properly obscure sensitive information in application snapshots.

**Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive data (potentially including user credentials, personal information, or other private details) could be exposed to anyone with access to the Task Switcher.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could view the sensitive data by simply accessing the Task Switcher when the vulnerable application is in the background or suspended. No specific user interaction is required beyond normal use of the Task Switcher.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the device and the ability to use the Task Switcher. No specific skills or access beyond that are needed.
