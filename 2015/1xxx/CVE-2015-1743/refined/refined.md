Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Internet Explorer add-on installer handles permissions, specifically in its use of special paths and junction points. This allows an attacker to bypass security checks during the add-on installation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation within the add-on installer.
- Inadequate handling of special paths and junction points.
- Failure to enforce Enhanced Protected Mode restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with medium-integrity, effectively bypassing Enhanced Protected Mode. While this alone does not permit arbitrary code execution, it can be chained with other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution, to gain increased privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** Attackers can host a malicious website or embed malicious content on compromised sites.
- **File-based attack:** Attackers can trick users into opening malicious files.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page, clicking a link, or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into existing websites.
- Ability to craft malicious files that exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to convince a user to interact with the malicious content.
- No specific network access is required, just the ability to deliver the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the sandbox provided by Enhanced Protected Mode.
- This vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by Thomas Vanhoutte.
- A patch was released by Microsoft to correct this vulnerability.
