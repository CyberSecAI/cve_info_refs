Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1747:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `jscript9.dll` component of Internet Explorer.
- It involves the interaction of creating a `DataView` object with an `ArrayBuffer` and the `neuter` function.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses Present:**

- Memory Corruption: Specifically, the vulnerability allows for read and write access to arbitrary memory locations, due to improper handling of `DataView` objects and `ArrayBuffer` when used in conjunction with the `neuter` function.
- Incorrect Memory Handling: The core issue is that the browser is not handling memory operations correctly, allowing an attacker to manipulate memory in a way that should not be possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Privilege Escalation: While not a direct privilege escalation, the attacker gains code execution within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Web-based Attack: Attackers can host a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when a user visits it.
- Malicious Files: Opening a specially crafted file could also trigger the vulnerability.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites accepting user-generated content to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Remote: Attackers do not need to be on the same network as the victim.
- User Interaction: The user needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file for the exploit to work. The attacker cannot force the user to interact with the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Internet Explorer 11 on Windows client systems.
- Microsoft addressed the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2015-03-18, and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2015-06-11.
- The vulnerability was identified by lokihardt@ASRT.
- The vulnerability is related to the DataView object and ArrayBuffer manipulation with the `neuter` function.
- The provided Microsoft bulletin (MS15-056) lists CVE-2015-1747 as a Critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Internet Explorer 11 on client systems and a Moderate RCE vulnerability on server systems.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The update also includes defense-in-depth updates to help improve security-related features.
