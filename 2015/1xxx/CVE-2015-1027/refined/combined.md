# Percona Security Advisory CVE-2015-1027

## Summary

During a code audit performed internally at Percona, we discovered a
 viable information disclosure attack when coupled with a MITM attack
 in which percona-toolkit and xtrabackup perl components could be
 coerced into returning additional MySQL configuration information.
 The vulnerability has since been closed.

## Timeline

2014-12-16 Initial research, proof of concept exploitation and report completion
 2015-01-07 CVE reservation request to Mitre, [LP 1408375](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/%2Bbug/1408375)

 2015-01-26 2.2.13 percona toolkit released: [blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2015/01/26/percona-toolkit-2-2-13-now-available/)
 2015-02-17 2.2.9 xtrabackup released: [blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2015/02/17/percona-xtrabackup-2-2-9-now-available/)
 2015-05-06 Publication of this document

## Analysis

The vulnerability exists in the –version-check functionality of the
 perl scripts ([LP 1408375](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/%2Bbug/1408375)), whilst the fix implemented for CVE-2014-2029
 ([LP 1279502](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/%2Bbug/1279502)) did patch the arbitrary command execution, MySQL
 configuration information may still be exfiltrated by this method.

The normal HTTP/HTTPS conversation is as follows during a –version-check
 call.
  `GET / HTTP/1.1
 User-Agent: HTTP-Micro/0.01

 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
 X-Pad: avoid browser bug

The issue centers around the interpretation of the response string
  `MySQL;mysql_variable;version_comment,version`
 This could be modified to extract additional information, for example the
 ssl\_key path.
  `MySQL;mysql_variable;version_comment,version,ssl_key`
 The program flow for –version-check is as follows
 pingback -> parse\_server\_response -> get\_versions -> sub\_for\_type.
 The issue is the literal lookup of MySQL variables version\_comment,
 version, ssl\_key (version 2.2.13 hard codes these to version\_comment,version).

There also exists an issue with silent HTTP “downgrade” when SSL connection fails
 in versions < 2.2.13.
  `7077 my $protocol = 'https'; # optimistic, but...
 7078 eval { require IO::Socket::SSL; };
 7079 if ( $EVAL_ERROR ) {
 7080 PTDEBUG && _d($EVAL_ERROR);
 7081 $protocol = 'http';
 7082 }`

## Mitigating factors

This does require an existing presence in order to perform
 the MITM attack, and spoof responses from v.percona.com.

This attack is limited to disclosing MySQL configuration information only, no data ex-filtration is known via this method at this time.

Debian && Ubuntu distribution packagers disabled this code in response to [CVE-2014-2029](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2014-2029)

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach. It provides me with daily opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from all over the world, which enriches my work experience. We push boundaries, offer flexibility, and create a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and finding a better way. Percona is more than just a workplace; it is a global community of passionate experts, making it a great place to work.”

Fix for bug 929046: SUB.001, LIT.001 ...   **Author:** [Brian Fraser](https://launchpad.net/~fraserbn)  **Revision Date:** 2012-12-03 03:17:39 UTC  Fix for [bug 929046](/bugs/929046): SUB.001, LIT.001 and LIT.002 are sensitive to program state  The original bug was about SUB.001, but LIT.00[12] were affected as well. The bug boiled down to using //g on $event->{arg}, but here's a simplified version:  my $str = "abc in stuff";  # This will print "6"  say $str =~ /in/g ? pos($str) : "no match";  # This will print "no match"  say $str =~ /abc/g ? pos($str) : "no match";  The second doesn't match because it will start from after the "in" that the previous regex matched, at which point it's too late to match abc.  There's two solutions to this: First, to use lvalue pos() before each match, ala pos($str) = 0; -- But that's doing a lot of extra stuff to work around our own bug. The other solution, and what this commit implements, is not using //g and pos() at all, instead using the @+ variable. $+[0] already holds the data we need, at no extra cost, and to boot makes things slightly faster.  So what was previously  if ( $str =~ m/./g ) {    return pos($str)  }  Is now  if ( $str =~ m/./ ) {    return $+[0];  } |

# Percona Security Advisory CVE-2015-1027

## Summary

During a code audit performed internally at Percona, we discovered a
 viable information disclosure attack when coupled with a MITM attack
 in which percona-toolkit and xtrabackup perl components could be
 coerced into returning additional MySQL configuration information.
 The vulnerability has since been closed.

## Timeline

## Analysis

The vulnerability exists in the –version-check functionality of the
 perl scripts ([LP 1408375](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/%2Bbug/1408375)), whilst the fix implemented for CVE-2014-2029
 ([LP 1279502](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/%2Bbug/1279502)) did patch the arbitrary command execution, MySQL
 configuration information may still be exfiltrated by this method.

The normal HTTP/HTTPS conversation is as follows during a –version-check
 call.
  `GET / HTTP/1.1
 User-Agent: HTTP-Micro/0.01

 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
 X-Pad: avoid browser bug

The issue centers around the interpretation of the response string
  `MySQL;mysql_variable;version_comment,version`
 This could be modified to extract additional information, for example the
 ssl\_key path.
  `MySQL;mysql_variable;version_comment,version,ssl_key`
 The program flow for –version-check is as follows
 pingback -> parse\_server\_response -> get\_versions -> sub\_for\_type.
 The issue is the literal lookup of MySQL variables version\_comment,
 version, ssl\_key (version 2.2.13 hard codes these to version\_comment,version).

There also exists an issue with silent HTTP “downgrade” when SSL connection fails
 in versions < 2.2.13.
  `7077 my $protocol = 'https'; # optimistic, but...
 7078 eval { require IO::Socket::SSL; };
 7079 if ( $EVAL_ERROR ) {
 7080 PTDEBUG && _d($EVAL_ERROR);
 7081 $protocol = 'http';
 7082 }`

## Mitigating factors

This does require an existing presence in order to perform
 the MITM attack, and spoof responses from v.percona.com.

This attack is limited to disclosing MySQL configuration information only, no data ex-filtration is known via this method at this time.

Debian && Ubuntu distribution packagers disabled this code in response to [CVE-2014-2029](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2014-2029)
