# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# oxide-qt 1.5.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.3 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
oxide-qt (1.5.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.3) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.5.5 - see USN-2521-1
    - Bump Chromium rev to 41.0.2272.76
    - Fix LP: [#1427828](/bugs/1427828) - Crash in WebFrame.sendMessageNoReply
    - Fix LP: [#1411159](/bugs/1411159) - Add work-around for shutdown crash in
      content::GpuChannelHost::Send, by deliberately leaking the
      cc::ContextProvider referenced by any task posted to the UI thread if
      the task never got a chance to run and is destroyed when the main loop
      is torn down. Note that 1.6 has the longer term fix for this crash.
    - Fix LP: [#1421339](/bugs/1421339) - Two scrollbars shown on the phone at a page scale of 1.
      + This is fixed by disabling the outer viewport scrollbars when
        pinch-viewport is on (copying Chrome on Android).
      + Also style the pinch viewport overlay scrollbars like Chrome on Android,
        as opposed to using the default desktop style that are designed to be
        dragged with a pointer
    - Fix LP: [#1423531](/bugs/1423531) - LoadEvent.isError is false for the error page if the
      navigation is triggered from a session restore or reload
    - Fix LP: [#1402975](/bugs/1402975) - set a minimum viewport width of 980px on mobile
      for sites that don't specify a viewport width. Fixes layout of some
      desktop sites, and matches the behaviour of Chrome on Android
    - Fix LP: [#1412981](/bugs/1412981) - Geolocation permission requests from subframes are
      not cancelled if the frame is deleted or navigated to another site
    - Fix LP: [#1379776](/bugs/1379776) - Spoof Android for the purposes of GPU feature
      blacklisting on the phone. This means accelerated 2d canvas is now
      enabled on all devices that Chrome enables it on (including the Nexus 4),
      and other GPU features (eg, GPU rasterization) are enabled on devices
      where Chrome supports it
    - Fix LP: [#1370366](/bugs/1370366) - Add LocationBarController API, which allows the
      renderer compositor to calculate the position of the browser top header.
      This enables the header to be animated in sync with the content on
      scrolling
    - Fix LP: [#1408136](/bugs/1408136) - Committed LoadEvents fire for subframe loads when
      they shouldn't
    - Fix LP: [#1377198](/bugs/1377198) - CertificateError is not cancelled if you stop the
      pending navigation
    - Fix LP: [#1373383](/bugs/1373383) - The video player on Youtube does not resize correctly
      when transitioning from landscape to portrait. Ensure we correctly
      update the screen geometry and orientation visible to web content when
      the device orientation changes, and turn on orientation events
    - Really fix LP: [#1337506](/bugs/1337506) - Abort with
      "FATAL:texture_manager.cc(76)] Check failed: texture_count_ == 0u (1 vs. 0)"
      on shutdown
    - Fix LP: [#1398044](/bugs/1398044) - Fails to build with Qt 5.4
    - Fix LP: [#1249387](/bugs/1249387) - Add experimental support for playing audio through
      mediahub with the HTML media elements (Off by default. Video and
      MediaSource are not yet implemented. Not built yet because it depends
      on packages in universe)
    - Fix LP: [#1417042](/bugs/1417042) - Remove inactive touch points from the current touch
      state when we process a new touch event
    - Fix LP: [#1417963](/bugs/1417963) - Adapt to behaviour change in handling of QVariants
      from QML to C++ in Qt 5.4
    - Update the form factor detection code to not rely on the EGL vendor for
      detecting that we're on a device - use the Android system properties
      instead
    - Tidy up WebContents ownership during unload by adding a new singleton
      responsible for handling unloading (WebContentsUnloader)
    - Refactor WebFrame to be based around RenderFrameHost rather than
      FrameTreeNode, which we aren't meant to be using
    - Call QDesktopServices::openUrl on the UI thread. Failures are no longer
      propagated back to the resource dispatcher, so all attempts to open a
      URL externally will result in the load being cancelled whether there
      is an external handler or not
  * Update debian/control to add extra build dependencies:
    - libandroid-properties-dev on armhf, used for gathering data for GPU
      feature blacklisting when running on the phone
  * Update debian/liboxideqtcore0.install to install V8 snapshot data
  * Backport r949 from trunk, fixing build with Qt5.2
  * Backport r1005 from trunk to disable Blink symbols and pass
    --no-keep-files-mapped to the linker on native x86 builds, to work around
    linker OOM

## Details

Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2015-1213](/security/CVE-2015-1213), [CVE-2015-1214](/security/CVE-2015-1214), [CVE-2015-1215](/security/CVE-2015-1215))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2015-1216](/security/CVE-2015-1216))

Multiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1217](/security/CVE-2015-1217), [CVE-2015-1230](/security/CVE-2015-1230))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1218](/security/CVE-2015-1218), [CVE-2015-1223](/security/CVE-2015-1223))

An integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2015-1219](/security/CVE-2015-1219))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2015-1220](/security/CVE-2015-1220))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2015-1221](/security/CVE-2015-1221))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker

implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these

to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1222](/security/CVE-2015-1222))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in

Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1224](/security/CVE-2015-1224))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read

uninitialized memory. ([CVE-2015-1227](/security/CVE-2015-1227))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data

structure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1228](/security/CVE-2015-1228))

It was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject

cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a

malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2015-1229](/security/CVE-2015-1229))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1231](/security/CVE-2015-1231))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-2238](/security/CVE-2015-2238))

page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215, CVE-2015-1216,
CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1219, CVE-2015-1220, CVE-2015-1221,
CVE-2015-1222, CVE-2015-1223, CVE-2015-1224, CVE-2015-1225, CVE-2015-1226,

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 41.0.2272.76, which corrects these issues. After

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
