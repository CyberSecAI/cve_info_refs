Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-1419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in how vsftpd was parsing the `deny_file` option in its configuration. The parsing was not behaving as expected, which allowed for potential unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the `deny_file` option in vsftpd. This means that the intended restrictions based on file patterns in the `deny_file` setting were not correctly enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to files, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass intended file access restrictions imposed by the `deny_file` configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker may gain access to files that should have been blocked by the `deny_file` setting. This suggests a local or remote attack, depending on the specific vsftpd setup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vsftpd server and attempt to access files that should have been restricted by the misconfigured `deny_file` option. This implies that the attacker could either be local to the machine running vsftpd, or have network access to the service if exposed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content contains a reference to bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900326 which provides more details regarding the vulnerability, which is used by both openSUSE and SUSE.
