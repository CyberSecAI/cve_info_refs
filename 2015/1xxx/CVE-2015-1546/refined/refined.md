Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1546:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a double free error in the `get_vrFilter` function located in `servers/slapd/filter.c` of OpenLDAP. This occurs when processing a search query that includes a matched values control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Double Free:** The core issue is a double free vulnerability. Memory allocated for the `vrFilter` is freed multiple times due to a logic error in the `vrFilter_free` function. Specifically, `vrf` pointer is not advanced in the loop during deallocation, leading to double free issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted search query to the OpenLDAP server. This results in a crash of the `slapd` process, making the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via a crafted LDAP search query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenLDAP server.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability can be triggered with an unauthenticated request.
*   **LDAP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the LDAP protocol and how to craft a search query that includes the "Matched Values" control to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details (From Various Sources):**

*   The vulnerability is a regression introduced in OpenLDAP 2.4.40. Earlier versions are not affected.
*   The vulnerable code path is triggered when the server processes a search query with the `Matched Values` control
*   The `vrFilter_free` function was found to have a flaw where the `vrf` pointer was not updated properly in the deallocation loop, leading to a double free condition.
*   The attack can be triggered using ldapsearch with the `-E 'mv=(cn={*)(sn=*)'` option.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in OpenLDAP versions after 2.4.40 by applying a patch which corrects the loop in `vrFilter_free` function.
*   Users should upgrade to patched versions of OpenLDAP provided by their distribution or build OpenLDAP from source with the appropriate fix.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ryan Tandy.
*   The issue was assigned CVE-2015-1546.
*   Patches were quickly released for various Linux distributions including Debian, SUSE, and openSUSE.
*   Apple also addressed this vulnerability as part of their security updates.
