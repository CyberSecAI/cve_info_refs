  "cve": "CVE-2015-1730",
  "description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer 9. A pointer set up to point to certain data on the stack can be used after that data has been removed from the stack. This results in a stack-based analog to a heap use-after-free vulnerability. The stack memory where the data was stored can be modified by an attacker before it is used, allowing remote code execution.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `Javascript_Stack_Walker` class of Internet Explorer 9 where a pointer variable initialized on the stack during the first exception is reused in a second exception without validating if the data it points to is still valid. The data, stored on the stack, is removed after the first exception.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free on stack memory",
      "Improper handling of stack data",
      "Lack of proper pointer validation before use",
      "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has admin rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted webpage. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create and host a malicious webpage. They must also convince a user to visit the malicious webpage using Internet Explorer 9."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Internet Explorer 9 on affected Windows clients"
  ],
    "remediation": "Apply the security update MS15-056, which addresses the issue by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory."
