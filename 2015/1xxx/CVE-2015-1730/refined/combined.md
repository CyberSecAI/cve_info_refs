## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3058515)

Published: June 9, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Preventing browser histories from being accessed by a malicious site
* Adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer
* Modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1765

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to gain access to a userâs browser history.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing browser histories from being accessed by a malicious site. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1765](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1765) | Yes | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

## Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1739) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1748](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1748) | No | No |

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |

## Vulnerability Information

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1765

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to gain access to a userâs browser history.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing browser histories from being accessed by a malicious site. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1765](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1765) | Yes | No |

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

## Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-1739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1739) | No | No |

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. A pointer set up to point to certain data on the stack can be used after that data has been removed from the stack. This results in a stack-based analog to a heap use-after-free vulnerability. The stack memory where the data was stored can be modified by an attacker before it is used, allowing remote code execution.

Known affected software and attack vectors

Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Java­Script should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Repro.html:

<!doctype html>
<script>
  var o­Window = window.open("about:blank");
  o­Window.exec­Script('window.o­URIError = new URIError();o­URIError.name = o­URIError;')
  try { "" + o­Window.o­URIError; } catch(e) { }
  try { "" + o­Window.o­URIError; } catch(e) { }
</script>

Description

A Javascript can construct an URIError object and sets that object's name property to refer to the URIError object, creating a circular reference. When that Javascript than attempts to convert the URIError object to a string, MSIE attempts to convert the URIError object's name to a string, which creates a recursive code loop that eventually causes a stack exhaustion.

MSIE attempts to handle this situation gracefully by generating a Java­Script exception. While generating the exception, information about the call stack is gathered using the Javascript­Stack­Walker class. It appears that the code that does this initializes a pointer variable on the stack the first time it is run, but re-uses it if it gets called a second time. Unfortunately, the information the pointer points to is also stored on the stack, but is removed from the stack after the first exception is handled. Careful manipulation of the stack during both exceptions allow an attacker to control the data the pointer points to during the second exception.

This problem is not limited to the URIError object: any recursive function call can be used to trigger the issue, as shown in the exploit below.

Exploit

As mentioned above, the vulnerable pointer points to valid stack memory during the first exception, but it is "popped" from the stack before the second. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the code executed during the first exception is going to point this pointer to a specific area of the stack, while the code executed during the second is going to allocate certain values in that same area before the pointer is re-used.

Control over the stack contents during a stack exhaustion can be achieved by making the recursive calls with many arguments, all of which are stored on the stack. This is similar to a heap-spray storing values on large sections of the heap in that it is not entirely deterministic, but the odds are very highly in favor of you setting a certain value at a certain address.

The exploit triggers the first exception by making recursive calls using a lot of arguments. In each loop, a lot of stack space is needed to make the next call. At some point there will not be enough stack space left to make another call and an exception is thrown. If N arguments are passed during each call, N*4 bytes of stack are needed to store them. The number of bytes left on the stack at the time of the exception varies from 0 to about 4*N and thus averages to about 4*N/2. The vulnerable pointer gets initialized to point to an address near the stack pointer at the time of the exception, at approximately (bottom of stack) + 4*N/2.

The exploit then triggers another stack exhaustion by making recursive calls using many arguments, but significantly less than before. If M arguments are passed during each call this time, the number of bytes left on the stack at the time of the exception averages to about 4*M/2.

When the second exception happens, the vulnerable pointer points inside the stack that was "sprayed" with function arguments. This means we can control where it points to. The pointer is used as an object pointer to get a function address from a vftable, so by using the right value to spray the stack, we can gain full control over execution flow.

The below schematic shows the layout of the stack during the various stages of this exploit:

|                Vulnerable pointer still points around here, most likely at   |
|                one of the arguments pushed onto the stack in a call.         |
|                                                                              |

In the Proof-of-Concept code provided below, the first exception is triggered by recursively calling a function with 0x2000 arguments (N = 0x2000). The second exception is triggered by recursively calling a function with 0x200 arguments (M = 0x200). The values passed as arguments during the second stack exhaustion are set to cause the vulnerable pointer to point to a fake vftable on the heap. The heap is sprayed to create this fake vftable. A fake function address is stored at 0x28000201 (p­Target) that points to a dummy shellcode consisting of int3's at 0x28000300 (p­Shellcode). Once the vulnerability is triggered, the vulnerable pointer is used to read the pointer to our shellcode from our fake vftable and called, which will attempt to execute our shellcode.

Time-line
13 October 2012: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
29 October 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to EIP.
18 November 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.
27 November 2012: EIP declines to acquire this vulnerability because they believe it to be a copy of another vulnerability they already acquired.
7 December 2012: ZDI declines to acquire this vulnerability because they believe it not to be exploitable.

During the initial report detailed above, I did not have a working exploit to prove exploitability. I also expected the bug to be fixed soon, seeing how EIP believed they already reported it to Microsoft. However, about two years later, I decided to look at the issue again and found it had not yet been fixed. Apparently it was not the same issue that EIP reported to Microsoft. So, I decided to try to have another look and developed a Proof-of-Concept exploit.

April 2014: I start working on this case again, and eventually develop a working Proof-of-Concept exploit.
6 November 2014: ZDI was informed of the new analysis and reopens the case.
15 November 2014: This vulnerability was submitted to i­Defense.
16 November 2014: i­Defense responds to my report email in plain text, potentially exposing the full vulnerability details to world+dog.
17 November 2014: ZDI declines to acquire this vulnerability after being informed of the potential information leak.
11 December 2012: This vulnerability was acquired by i­Defense.
The accidentally potential disclosure of vulnerability details by i­Defense was of course a bit of a disappointment. They reported that they have since updated their email system to automatically encrypt emails, which should prevent this from happening again.

9 June 2015: Microsoft addresses this vulnerability in MS15-056.
6 December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

MSIE jscript9 Java­Script­Stack­Walker memory corruption

![](/Images/Vuln.svg "Vuln")![](/Images/Sploit.svg "Sploit")![](/Images/Microsoft Internet Explorer.svg "Microsoft Internet Explorer")

# MSIE jscript9 Java­Script­Stack­Walker memory corruption

([MS15-056](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-056), [CVE-2015-1730](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1730))

## Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability in
Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. A pointer set up to point to certain data on the
stack can be used after that data has been removed from the stack. This results
in a stack-based analog to a heap use-after-free vulnerability. The stack
memory where the data was stored can be modified by an attacker before it is
used, allowing remote code execution.

## Known affected software, attack vectors and potential mitigations

* **Microsoft Internet Explorer 9**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  web-page. Disabling Java­Script should prevent an attacker from triggering
  the vulnerable code path.

[Repro.html](/20161206001/Repro.html)

<!doctype html>
<script>
var o­Window = window.open("about:blank");
o­Window.exec­Script('window.o­URIError = new URIError();o­URIError.name = o­URIError;')
try { "" + o­Window.o­URIError; } catch(e) { }
try { "" + o­Window.o­URIError; } catch(e) { }
</script>

## Description

A Javascript can construct an `URIError` object and sets that object's `name`
property to refer to the `URIError` object, creating a circular reference. When
that Javascript than attempts to convert the `URIError` object to a string,
MSIE attempts to convert the `URIError` object's `name` to a string, which
creates a recursive code loop that eventually causes a stack exhaustion.

MSIE attempts to handle this situation gracefully by generating a Java­Script
exception. While generating the exception, information about the call stack is
gathered using the Javascript­Stack­Walker class. It appears that the code that
does this initializes a pointer variable on the stack the first time it is run,
but re-uses it if it gets called a second time. Unfortunately, the information
the pointer points to is also stored on the stack, but is removed from the
stack after the first exception is handled. Careful manipulation of the stack
during both exceptions allow an attacker to control the data the pointer points
to during the second exception.

This problem is not limited to the `URIError` object: any recursive function
call can be used to trigger the issue, as shown in the exploit below.

## Exploit

As mentioned above, the vulnerable pointer points to valid stack memory during
the first exception, but it is "popped" from the stack before the second. In
order to exploit this vulnerability, the code executed during the first
exception is going to point this pointer to a specific area of the stack, while
the code executed during the second is going to allocate certain values in that
same area before the pointer is re-used.

Control over the stack contents during a stack exhaustion can be achieved by
making the recursive calls with many arguments, all of which are stored on the
stack. This is similar to a heap-spray storing values on large sections of the
heap in that it is not entirely deterministic, but the odds are very highly in
favor of you setting a certain value at a certain address.

The exploit triggers the first exception by making recursive calls using a lot
of arguments. In each loop, a lot of stack space is needed to make the next
call. At some point there will not be enough stack space left to make another
call and an exception is thrown. If `N` arguments are passed during each call,
`N*4` bytes of stack are needed to store them. The number of bytes left on the
stack at the time of the exception varies from `0` to about `4*N` and thus
averages to about `4*N/2`. The vulnerable pointer gets initialized to point to
an address near the stack pointer at the time of the exception, at
approximately `(bottom of stack) + 4*N/2`.

The exploit then triggers another stack exhaustion by making recursive calls
using many arguments, but significantly less than before. If `M` arguments are
passed during each call this time, the number of bytes left on the stack
at the time of the exception averages to about `4*M/2`.

When the second exception happens, the vulnerable pointer points inside the
stack that was "sprayed" with function arguments. This means we can control
where it points to. The pointer is used as an object pointer to get a function
address from a vftable, so by using the right value to spray the stack, we can
gain full control over execution flow.

The below schematic shows the layout of the stack during the various stages of
this exploit:

| |
|<--bottom of stack top of stack-->|
| |
| Stack layout at the moment the first exception is triggered: |
| |
| [--- CALL X ---][-- CALL X-1 --][-- CALL X-2 --][...........]|
| |
|<---------------> Stack space available is less than 4\*N bytes |
| |
| ^^^ |
| Vulnerable pointer gets initialized to point around here |
| |
| |
| |
| Stack layout at the moment the second exception is triggered: |
| |
| [CALL Y][CALL Y-1][CALL Y-2][CALL Y-3][CALL Y-3][........................]|
| |
|<--> Stack space available is less than 4\*M bytes |
| |
| ^^^ |
| Vulnerable pointer still points around here, most likely at |
| one of the arguments pushed onto the stack in a call. |
| |

In the Proof-of-Concept code provided below, the first exception is triggered
by recursively calling a function with 0x2000 arguments (`N` = 0x2000). The
second exception is triggered by recursively calling a function with 0x200
arguments (`M` = 0x200). The values passed as arguments during the second stack
exhaustion are set to cause the vulnerable pointer to point to a fake vftable
on the heap. The heap is sprayed to create this fake vftable. A fake function
address is stored at 0x28000201 (`p­Target`) that points to a dummy shellcode
consisting of int3's at 0x28000300 (`p­Shellcode`). Once the vulnerability is
triggered, the vulnerable pointer is used to read the pointer to our shellcode
from our fake vftable and called, which will attempt to execute our shellcode.

## Time-line

* *13 October 2012*: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* *29 October 2012*: This vulnerability was submitted to [EIP](https://rsp.exodusintel.com/).
* *18 November 2012*: This vulnerability was submitted to [ZDI](http://zerodayinitiative.com/).
* *27 November 2012*: EIP declines to acquire this vulnerability because they
  believe it to be a copy of another vulnerability they already acquired.
* *7 December 2012*: ZDI declines to acquire this vulnerability because they
  believe it not to be exploitable.

During the initial report detailed above, I did not have a working exploit to
prove exploitability. I also expected the bug to be fixed soon, seeing how
EIP believed they already reported it to Microsoft. However, about two years
later, I decided to look at the issue again and found it had not yet been
fixed. Apparently it was not the same issue that EIP reported to Microsoft. So,
I decided to try to have another look and developed a Proof-of-Concept exploit.

* *April 2014*: I start working on this case again, and eventually develop a
  working Proof-of-Concept exploit.
* *6 November 2014*: ZDI was informed of the new analysis and reopens the case.
* *15 November 2014*: This vulnerability was submitted to [i­Defense](https://labs.idefense.com/vcpportal/).
* *16 November 2014*: i­Defense responds to my report email in plain text,
  potentially exposing the full vulnerability details to world+dog.
* *17 November 2014*: ZDI declines to acquire this vulnerability after being
  informed of the potential information leak.
* *11 December 2012*: This vulnerability was acquired by i­Defense.

The accidentally potential disclosure of vulnerability details by i­Defense was
of course a bit of a disappointment. They reported that they have since updated
their email system to automatically encrypt emails, which should prevent this
from happening again.

* *9 June 2015*: Microsoft addresses this vulnerability in [MS15-056](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-056).
* *6 December 2016*: Details of this vulnerability are released.
