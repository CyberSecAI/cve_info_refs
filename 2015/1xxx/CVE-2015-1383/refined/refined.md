Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Geo Mashup plugin's search functionality. Specifically, the search key wasn't sanitized before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user input when displaying search results, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the search results page. This malicious script could perform various actions, such as:
    - Stealing cookies, which could lead to session hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Geo Mashup plugin's search functionality.
- An attacker crafts a malicious search query containing JavaScript code and submits it through the search form.
- The unsanitized search query is then reflected back in the search results page, executing the attacker's JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit search queries to the vulnerable website.
- No special privileges or user authentication is necessary for exploitation.
- The attacker's position is remote, being able to access the website through normal browsing means.

**Additional Details:**
