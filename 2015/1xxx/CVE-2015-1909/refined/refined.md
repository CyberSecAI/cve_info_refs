- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a weakly configured XML parser in IBM InfoSphere MDM Reference Data Management, which is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. This could lead to gaining WebSphere Commerce administrator access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially-crafted XML request to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted request to the affected system. The CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N) indicates that the attack vector is network-based, the attack complexity is low, authentication is required, and the impact is partial on confidentiality.
