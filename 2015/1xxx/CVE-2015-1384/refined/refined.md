Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-1384

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Banner Effect Header WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.2.7 and possibly below

**Root Cause:** The `banner_effect_divid` parameter in the plugin's settings page `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=BannerEffectOptions` is vulnerable to XSS. The application does not sanitize user input before reflecting it back in the web page.

**Weaknesses:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Lack of output encoding

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter.
- Successful exploitation can lead to hijacking of a logged-in user's session.
- Attackers can gain full admin privileges on the web application if the hijacked user is an administrator.
- The attacker can change the victim's password, invalidate their session, and maintain persistent access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the plugin's settings page: `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=BannerEffectOptions`
- The attacker injects malicious code within the `banner_effect_divid` parameter.
- The injected script executes in the victim's browser when the settings page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
- No special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability can be exploited against any logged-in user.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Omar Kurt while using the Netsparker Web Application Security Scanner.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.8 of the plugin.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download due to guideline violations as of January 28, 2022.
- The provided proof of concept uses `" onclick=alert(1) "` as the attack pattern, which will execute the JavaScript alert function and demonstrates that script code execution is possible.
