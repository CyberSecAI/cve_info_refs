From: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@...edump.cx>
To: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in LibTIFF and associated tools

Oh well... if the cat is out the bag anyway, here's what I reported to
them. These affect the library itself and would also impact uses
within ImageMagick, etc.

<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-mem2.tif>

  - uninitialized memory in putcontig8bitCIELab / TIFFCIELabToXYZ
    I'm guesisng this is a dupe of CVE-2014-8127

<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-cvs-1.tif>

  - uninitialized memory in putcontig8bitYCbCr21tile
    Fixed in:

      2014-12-29  Even Rouault  <even.rouault@...tialys.com>

      * libtiff/tif_getimage.c: in OJPEG case, fix checks on strile width/height
        in the putcontig8bitYCbCr42tile, putcontig8bitYCbCr41tile and
        putcontig8bitYCbCr21tile cases.

    I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.

<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff-cvs-2.tif>

  - uninitialized memory in NeXTDecode
    Fixed in:

      2014-12-29  Even Rouault  <even.rouault@...tialys.com>

      * libtiff/tif_next.c: add new tests to check that we don't read outside of
      the compressed input stream buffer.

    I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.

<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/vulns/libtiff5.tif>

  - another use of uninitialized memory in NeXTDecode after fixing the
previous case.
    I don't think this had a CVE number assigned yet.

The communications with upstream have been spotty, which is probably
in part because many people are submitting crash reports at once. I
don't know when they plan the next release, and the commits often
aren't flagged as security-relevant or credited to any particular
report or reporter.

Anyway, the bottom line is that for now, using the last stable version
of libtiff on anything attacker-controlled is probably a bad idea.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2014-9655, CVE-2015-1547, CVE-2015-8784, CVE-2015-8683, CVE-2015-8665, CVE-2015-8781, CVE-2015-8782, CVE-2015-8783, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-5320)
* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, tiff2rgba). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8129, CVE-2014-8130, CVE-2014-9330, CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2015-8668, CVE-2016-3632, CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-3991)

Use CVE-2014-9655 for these two issues related to access of uninitialized
memory, as demonstrated by libtiff-cvs-1.tif and libtiff-cvs-2.tif.

Debian Bug     : 808968 809021

Several vulnerabilities have been found in tiff, a Tag Image File Format
library. Multiple out-of-bounds read and write flaws could cause an
application using the tiff library to crash.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.2-6+deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

+ 18 October 2016
+ 17 January 2017
+ 18 April 2017
+ 18 July 2017

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libTIFF, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.7** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifier and bug reports referenced for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
image file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.7"

```

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**
