    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-1547",
    "description": "The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2014-9655, CVE-2015-1547, CVE-2015-8784, CVE-2015-8683, CVE-2015-8665, CVE-2015-8781, CVE-2015-8782, CVE-2015-8783, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-5320)\n* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, tiff2rgba). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8129, CVE-2014-8130, CVE-2014-9330, CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2015-8668, CVE-2016-3632, CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-3991)",
    "affected_component": "libtiff",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of uninitialized memory in the NeXTDecode function when processing certain TIFF files with extension tags. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs within the compressed input stream buffer due to insufficient checks after a previous fix for another vulnerability in the same function.",
      "weakness": [
          "Use of uninitialized memory",
          "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to process a specially crafted TIFF file.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable application or tool that uses the libtiff library.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted TIFF file to a user or application processing such files."
