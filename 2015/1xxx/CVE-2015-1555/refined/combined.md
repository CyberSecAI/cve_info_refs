# ZF2015-01: Session validation vulnerability

`Zend\Session` session validators do not work as expected if set prior to the
start of a session.

For instance, the following test case fails (where `$this->manager` is an
instance of `Zend\Session\SessionManager`):

```
$this
    ->manager
    ->getValidatorChain()
    ->attach('session.validate', array(new RemoteAddr(), 'isValid'));

$this->manager->start();

$this->assertSame(
    array(
        'Zend\Session\Validator\RemoteAddr' =3D> '',
    ),
    $_SESSION['__ZF']['_VALID']
);

```

The implication is that subsequent calls to
`Zend\Session\SessionManager#start()` (in later requests, assuming a session was
created) will not have any validator metadata attached, which causes any
validator metadata to be re-built from scratch, thus marking the session as
valid.

An attacker is thus able to simply ignore session validators such as `RemoteAddr`
or `HttpUserAgent`, since the "signature" that these validators check against is
not being stored in the session.

## Action Taken

We now store the signature of the validators in the session immediately
following the call to `session_start()`, preventing any data loss from session
validators.

The patch fixing the issue has been applied in the following versions:

* Zend Framework 2.2.9
* Zend Framework 2.3.4

## Recommendations

If you are using session validators, we recommend upgrading immediately.
