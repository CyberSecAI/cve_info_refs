The provided content is related to **CVE-2015-1555**. It describes a session validation vulnerability in Zend Framework.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that `Zend\Session` session validators were not working correctly when set prior to the start of a session. Specifically, the "signature" of the validators was not being stored in the session immediately after `session_start()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session validator metadata is not being properly stored when validators are attached before the session starts.
- Subsequent calls to `Zend\Session\SessionManager#start()` would rebuild validator metadata from scratch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could bypass session validators like `RemoteAddr` or `HttpUserAgent`.
- Session validators are effectively ignored, as the "signature" they check against is not stored.
- An attacker could establish a valid session with a different IP or user-agent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this by initiating a session without any valid validation metadata stored. This means that they can then access the session using a different client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a session with the server.
- They do not require any prior privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves storing the signature of the validators in the session immediately after `session_start()`.
- Patches were applied in Zend Framework 2.2.9 and 2.3.4.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yuriy Dyachenko and the patch was provided by Marco Pivetta.
