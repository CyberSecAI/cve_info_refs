  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of trailing paths in URLs, specifically when using PATH_INFO or similar mechanisms. The application does not explicitly disallow or sanitize these trailing paths, leading to unexpected behavior.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
        "Improper handling of trailing paths in URLs",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML by crafting a malicious URL with trailing paths. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of users, steal session cookies, or redirect users to malicious websites.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted URL with trailing paths after a PHP file (e.g., `/path/index.php/more/path`). This vulnerability is particularly exploitable in web server configurations that allow PHP files to be accessed in this manner.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server or application, other than the ability to send HTTP requests."
