{
  "CVE-2015-1725": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `win32k!vSolidFillRect` function when it improperly validates user input.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the targeted system. This could lead to the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and the ability to execute programs on the local system."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in `SURFOBJ` due to an offset added to a non-zero value, potentially in 32-bit Windows versions. The exact cause is not 100% verified, but it results in a controlled EIP.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Null Pointer Dereference"
        ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS), and the attacker can control the EIP register. The PoC sets the EIP to 0xdeadbeef.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to execute a specially crafted application on the local system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and the ability to execute programs on the local system."
