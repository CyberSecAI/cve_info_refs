{
  "CVE-2015-1798": {
    "Root cause": "The ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication Code (MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured to use symmetric cryptographic keys.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect MAC validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Man-in-the-middle attackers could send crafted packets that would be accepted by a client or a peer without knowing the symmetric key, potentially allowing them to spoof packets.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Spoofed packets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with a privileged network position and the ability to craft network packets."
  },
  "CVE-2015-1799": {
    "Root cause": "The ntpd performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain invalid packets due to a vulnerability in the authentication code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Invalid processing of NTP packets when authentication fails"
    ],
    "Impact": "Man-in-the-middle attackers can cause a denial of service by disrupting communication between NTP hosts, preventing synchronization.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Man-in-the-middle attack",
       "Spoofed peer source IP address"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with a privileged network position and the ability to spoof IP addresses of peering ntp servers."
