**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an error in the `ssl3_get_key_exchange` function in OpenSSL's `ssl/s3_clnt.c`. This function does not properly handle a zero `p` value within an anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH) `ServerKeyExchange` message.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of a zero `p` value in anonymous DH key exchange.
    *   NULL pointer dereference leading to a segmentation fault

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (DoS) is the primary impact, specifically a segmentation fault and application crash.
    *   The server will terminate the connection.
    * Potential impact on confidentiality if other vulnerabilities are present.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is remote, via a network.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious server sending a crafted `ServerKeyExchange` message during an SSL/TLS handshake.
    *   The attack happens during an SSL connection setup, specifically during the key exchange process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be in a position to act as a server during the SSL/TLS handshake.
    *   No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e.
*   SUSE indicates the issue has low severity, while NVD gives a base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
*   The vulnerability is specifically associated with the anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.
*   SUSE information also notes that the issue does not affect OpenSSL 1.0.1 or older releases.
*   Cisco's advisory indicates that multiple products are affected, as they include an affected version of OpenSSL. They also state, "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by returning malicious values to a client application using OpenSSL."
*   Slackware's advisory indicates that the bug is fixed in openssl package updates and references that specific commit IDs.
*   Ubuntu mentions the bug occurs if the server sends a `ServerKeyExchange` message with the value of p set to 0.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-1794 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.0.2 (before 1.0.2e) due to improper handling of a zero `p` value in anonymous DH key exchange. This can cause a segmentation fault on the vulnerable system when a malicious server is used. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication.
