- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by constructing specific byte sequences during the authentication process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Consumption of all CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker sending crafted byte sequences during authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service.
