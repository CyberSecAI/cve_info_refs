- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM QRadar Incident Forensics authorization cookie is missing the `httponly` attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing `httponly` attribute in the authorization cookie, making it susceptible to session hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Session hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user sessions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network-based attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker could use XSS to steal the session cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application (e.g., through XSS) or be able to intercept the network traffic to obtain the session cookie.
