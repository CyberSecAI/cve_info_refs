  "CVE-2015-1424": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Gecko CMS suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including Cross-Site Request Forgery, Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, and lacks CSRF protections.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Cross-Site Scripting can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities. SQL injection can lead to data exposure or manipulation. CSRF can be used to perform unwanted actions by an authenticated user.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "CSRF": "A malicious web page could be crafted to send a POST request to the vulnerable server, taking advantage of the lack of CSRF protection.",
        "Stored XSS": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into input fields like 'jak_img', 'jak_name', and 'jak_url' which get stored and executed when displayed to other users.",
       "Reflected XSS": "The vulnerability is present in multiple parameters in the admin panel including horder[], jak_catid, jak_content, jak_css, jak_delete_log[], jak_email, jak_extfile, jak_file, jak_hookshow[], jak_img, jak_javascript, jak_lcontent, jak_name, jak_password, jak_showcontact, jak_tags, jak_title, jak_url, jak_username, real_hook_id[], sp, sreal_plugin_id[], ssp, sssp.  Additionally present in several parameters of /js/editor/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php (editor, field_id, fldr, lang, popup, subfolder, type).",
      "SQL Injection": "A specially crafted SQL query in the 'jak_delete_log[]' and 'ssp' parameters can be used to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database."
    },
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For stored XSS, an attacker would need to be able to post content (e.g. create a category). For CSRF attacks, an authenticated user must be tricked into visiting a malicious page. Reflected XSS requires the user to click on a specially crafted link. SQL Injection in the admin panel requires admin authentication.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the admin panel, and the vendor has stated that no fix will be developed."
