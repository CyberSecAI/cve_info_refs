Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-1609

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure in MongoDB's `mongod` server to properly validate malformed BSON (Binary JSON) data. Specifically, the server doesn't handle certain malformed BSON cases correctly, leading to an uncaught exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of incoming BSON data, which allows specifically crafted malformed data to trigger an error.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The uncaught exception resulting from the malformed BSON leads to a crash of the `mongod` server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the server crashing, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can send specially crafted malformed BSON data over the network to the MongoDB server.
- **Pre-Authentication:** The vulnerability is present before authentication, meaning that an attacker doesn't need valid credentials to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted MongoDB server.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs the knowledge to craft malformed BSON data that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Xiaopeng Zhang of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.
- MongoDB versions up to 2.6.7 are affected.
- The fix involves rejecting malformed BSON data.
- The issue is also referenced as Bug ID: SPL-106324 in Splunk products.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by limiting network access to the MongoDB server and upgrading to patched versions.
- Splunk Enterprise versions 6.2.x before 6.2.7 are also affected by the same vulnerability in their KV Store.
