Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2015-1932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise handle the `http.compliance.via` custom property.
- By default, the On Demand Router (ODR) and proxy server ignore this property and do not set the HTTP Via header. However, when this property is enabled, it can expose information that identifies the proxy server software being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain information about the proxy server software being used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-  An attacker can gather information about the infrastructure, potentially aiding in further attacks or reconnaissance. The impact is limited to information disclosure, and there's no direct compromise of system data or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote and over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Virtual Enterprise and observe the responses.
- No specific authentication is required. The attacker can be unauthenticated, and the attack does not require any specific user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The document specifies a new custom property, `http.ignore.compliance.via`, that if set to false, will allow the http.compliance.via setting to be honored, effectively enabling the vulnerability.
- The mitigation includes either removing the custom property `http.compliance.via` or setting it to false.
- The document provides instructions on how to remove or set this custom property via the Administrative console.
- Fixes are available through specific fix packs or interim fixes.
