Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) enforces the same-origin policy when processing Document Type Declarations (DTDs). This improper enforcement can lead to cross-domain data access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a bypass of the same-origin policy. This policy is a critical security mechanism that prevents scripts from one domain accessing resources from another domain. The vulnerability is present in the MSXML component.
- **Cross-domain data access:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially access sensitive information belonging to another domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive user information, such as usernames, passwords, and files on the victim's hard drive. This could lead to further compromise of user accounts and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email:** Attackers can send specially crafted links in emails and convince users to click on them.
- **Web-based:** Attackers can host malicious websites designed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to click on malicious links either through emails or by visiting a website controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific link that triggers the vulnerable code path in MSXML related to the processing of DTDs.
