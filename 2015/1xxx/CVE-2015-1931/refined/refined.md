Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1931:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

-   The root cause is that IBM Java Security Components store plain text data in memory dumps.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive information in plain text within memory dumps. This makes it easily accessible if the memory dumps are exposed or obtained by an unauthorized party.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure**: A local attacker could gain access to the plain text data from the memory dumps, which may contain sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys or passwords.
-   This information could then be used to aid in further attacks against the system.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Local access**: The primary attack vector is local, where an attacker with access to the system can obtain memory dumps.
-   The attacker needs to be able to obtain memory dumps from the affected system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to obtain memory dumps.
-   No network access or authentication is required, only access to the system where memory dumps are stored.
    
**Additional Information:**

-   Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability impacts several versions of IBM Java, specifically:
    - IBM SDK, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 11 and earlier releases.
    - IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 5 and earlier releases.
    - IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6R1 Service Refresh 8 Fix Pack 5 and earlier releases.
    - IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 7 Service Refresh 9 Fix Pack 1 and earlier releases.
    - IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 7R1 Service Refresh 3 Fix Pack 1 and earlier releases.
    - IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 Service Refresh 1 Fix Pack 1 and earlier releases.
-   The vulnerability was addressed in the IBM SDK, Java versions noted above which include IBM Java SE 7R1 SR3-FP10.
-   Several SUSE Linux Enterprise products and openSUSE versions were affected by this vulnerability.
-   Red Hat also released an advisory (RHSA-2015:1485) addressing this vulnerability in their `java-1.7.1-ibm` packages.

- The vulnerability is classified as **Important** by SUSE.
- The CVSS v3 score is 5.5 with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`, which reflects a local attack vector with low complexity and low privileges needed but a high impact on confidentiality.
-   Red Hat rated this as having a low severity impact with a fix being classified as a Bug Fix.
