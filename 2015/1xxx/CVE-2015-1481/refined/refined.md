Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1481:

**Root Cause:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The root cause is missing validation of the "is_superuser" parameter during user creation.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Vulnerable URL parameters in the Ansible Tower API.
*   **Missing Websocket Authentication:** Lack of authentication and authorization on the Websocket endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Organization administrators can create superuser accounts due to insufficient validation of the "is_superuser" parameter.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several API endpoints are vulnerable to reflected XSS via specific URL parameters.
*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The WebSocket endpoint used for real-time updates lacks authentication and authorization, leading to potential information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with organization admin privileges can gain full control over the Ansible Tower instance and all of its organizations, potentially accessing sensitive data of other customers.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can steal user sessions and potentially perform unauthorized actions.
*  **Missing Websocket Authentication:** Unauthorized users can access internal data about scheduled events and job related events, potentially aiding in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/users/` endpoint with the `is_superuser` parameter set to `true`.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Crafting malicious URLs with the vulnerable parameters (e.g., `order_by`, `next_run`) and tricking a user into accessing them.
*   **Missing Websocket Authentication:** Connecting to the WebSocket endpoint at `/socket.io/1/websocket/{id}` without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Requires an attacker to have organization administrator privileges.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Requires the attacker to lure a user into clicking on a crafted URL.
*  **Missing Websocket Authentication:** No specific privilege or authentication is required, any user with network access can connect to the websocket.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that only a short crash test was performed and it is assumed that further vulnerabilities might exist.
*   The websocket information leakage, while not considered critical on its own, might aid an attacker to perform further attacks.
*   The advisory includes specific vulnerable API endpoints for XSS.
*   A workaround is available for the Websocket vulnerability by blocking access to TCP port 8080.
