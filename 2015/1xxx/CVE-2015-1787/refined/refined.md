  "CVE-2015-1787": {
    "description": "The ssl3_get_client_key_exchange function in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a, when client authentication and an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphersuite are enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a ClientKeyExchange message with a length of zero.",

      "HP Matrix Operating Environment",
      "HP System Management Homepage (SMH)",

      "OpenSSL 1.0.2",
      "OpenSSL 1.0.2a"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ssl3_get_client_key_exchange` function of OpenSSL, where insufficient validation of the `ClientKeyExchange` message length occurs when client authentication is enabled with an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suite. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the `ClientKeyExchange` message has a length of zero.",

    "impact": "Remote denial of service (daemon crash).",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a ClientKeyExchange message with a length of zero.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to authenticate and can trigger this vulnerability over a network connection."
