- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This memory corruption can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker the same user rights as the current user. With administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit this vulnerability in Internet Explorer. They could also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-generated content/ads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious content via Internet Explorer.
