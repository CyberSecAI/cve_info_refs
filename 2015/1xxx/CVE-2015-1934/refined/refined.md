- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak default password requirements in new installations of IBM Maximo Asset Management, leading to weaker-than-expected password encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient password complexity requirements on new installations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could bypass security and obtain passwords using decryption tools.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could leverage the weak password encryption to gain unauthorized access. The initial vector is that the weak password requirements are in place in new installations of the product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to obtain encrypted passwords, access to decryption tools, and knowledge of the encryption method used.
