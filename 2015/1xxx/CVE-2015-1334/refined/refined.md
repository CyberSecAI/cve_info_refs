  "CVE-2015-1334": {
    "description": "attach.c in LXC 1.1.2 and earlier uses the proc filesystem in a container, which allows local container users to escape AppArmor or SELinux confinement by mounting a proc filesystem with a crafted (1) AppArmor profile or (2) SELinux label.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from LXC's `attach.c` improperly trusting the container's proc filesystem for setting up AppArmor and SELinux confinement. This allows a malicious container to replace the /proc mountpoint with a tampered version, and thereby bypass security policies.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper trust of container's proc filesystem",
        "Insufficient validation of container-provided data",
		"Inadequate security confinement mechanisms"
      ],
      "impact": "A local container user can escape AppArmor or SELinux confinement. This enables the attacker to execute code outside the container with elevated privileges on the host system potentially leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to a container",
        "Manipulation of the container's proc filesystem"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local user access to a container and the ability to mount filesystems inside the container."
    },
    "affected_versions": "LXC 1.1.2 and earlier.",
    "patch_details": "The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that the attach process does not use the container's /proc filesystem during attach and uses a sane /proc from the host system to set the security context.",
