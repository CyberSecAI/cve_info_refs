## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1271, CVE-2015-1270, CVE-2015-1272, CVE-2015-1273,
CVE-2015-1274, CVE-2015-1276, CVE-2015-1277, CVE-2015-1278, CVE-2015-1279,
CVE-2015-1281, CVE-2015-1282, CVE-2015-1283, CVE-2015-1284, CVE-2015-1285,
CVE-2015-1286, CVE-2015-1287, CVE-2015-1288, CVE-2015-1289, CVE-2015-5605)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 44.0.2403.89, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

## Issue [1165893004](/1165893004/): [Downloads] Prevent dangerous files from being opened automatically. (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 6 months ago by [asanka](/user/asanka)  **Modified:** 5 years, 6 months ago  **Reviewers:** [palmer](/user/palmer), [Randy Smith (Not in Mondays)](/user/Randy%20Smith%20%28Not%20in%20Mondays%29)  **CC:** benjhayden+dwatch\_chromium.org, chromium-apps-reviews\_chromium.org, chromium-reviews, extensions-reviews\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | Description[Downloads] Prevent executable files from being opened automatically. Users can accidentally mark executable or other dangerous file types for opening automatically upon download. This change prevents such file types from being considered for auto open. If the user already has any dangerous file types in the auto-open list, those entries will be ignored on new browser sessions. Any action that causes the persisted auto-open list to be updated will, as a side-effect, premanently remove any dangerous file types that were there. Currently the list of file types that are excluded from auto open is maintained by chrome/browser/download/download\_extension.cc. BUG=[461858](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=461858) TEST=(1) Download an .exe (on Windows) or .swf file. (2) Verify that the "Always open files of this type" option is disabled.

The check is different. GetFileDangerLevel() returns NOT_DANGEROUS if the file has no extension. We want files without extensions to return false from this function since they can't be opened automatically.  Also, regarding the ALLOW_ON_USER_GESTURE behavior: Downloads that had a user gesture and those that didn't are both equivalent by the time the download completes. Remember that if there wasn't a user gesture, we would've prompted the user. In either case, by the end there would be a user gesture.  The only exception to this rule are those files that are now being handled by SafeBrowsing. Those may not have a user gesture by the end of the download.

Chrome can only auto-open file it downloaded itself.   2. The files Chrome downloaded are have names corresponding to what DownloadItem::GetTargetFilePath() returns.   3. Said files consist of a primary data stream corresponding to the resource transferred from DownloadItem::GetURL().   4. Opening behavior of a downloaded file is predicted by the filename as mentioned in #2, and not on the contents of the primary data stream nor alternate streams.

Of course, they can be violated by some nefarious program running on the users' machine with user level privileges, but that's outside our threat model. ```     | **palmer** | | > Hm.

Which comment?  Whoops, sorry, I meant the test name, not the comment.  "NoAutoOpenForExecutables" implies to me that the test is either for all executable files or in some way for the class of files that is executables.  This is testing either just .swf files or the set of dangerous files.  I think you've changed the name in the latest PS, so feel free to ignore this comment.

Tuesday, July 21, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 44 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 44.0.2403.89 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/43.0.2357.134..44.0.2403.89?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 44.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1274 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1274)

#### Description

Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 does not ensure that the auto-open list omits all dangerous file types, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted file and leveraging a user's previous "Always open files of this type" choice, related to download\_commands.cc and download\_prefs.cc.
