Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1274:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Google Chrome did not properly ensure that dangerous file types were excluded from the auto-open list. This list is used when a user selects "Always open files of this type" during a download, causing files to be opened automatically after downloading. This lack of proper filtering made it easier for attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution through malicious files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The browser failed to validate the type of files added to the auto-open list, allowing dangerous file types to be included.
- **Improper Handling of User Preferences:** The browser did not restrict the auto-open functionality based on file types, leading to a security risk.
- **Missing Security Checks:** The auto-open functionality lacked adequate checks to prevent the execution of dangerous file types automatically.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on a user's system by crafting a malicious file, tricking the user into adding it to the auto-open list, and then having it automatically opened on subsequent downloads.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal sensitive information, or take other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack would typically involve delivering a crafted file to a victim over the network, usually through a web page or a link.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into downloading the malicious file and selecting "Always open files of this type" option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can be located remotely and does not require physical access to the victim's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires some form of user interaction: the victim must choose to enable auto-open for a dangerous file type.
- **Crafted File:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted file that could exploit the user's system.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 44.0.2403.89.
- Red Hat also addressed this issue in their security advisory RHSA-2015:1499.
- The vulnerability was related to `download_commands.cc` and `download_prefs.cc` files in the Chromium source code.
- The fix involved implementing a blacklist for file types that should not be opened automatically.
