Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1323:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from `Aptdaemon` incorrectly handling the `simulate` D-Bus method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper privilege handling in the `simulate` D-Bus method. Specifically, the code doesn't drop privileges when running `lintian`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker could exploit this flaw to expose sensitive information.
- The attacker could also perform file access operations with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to be on the system to exploit this.
- The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted call to the `simulate` D-Bus method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the `Aptdaemon` service via D-Bus.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves dropping privileges before running `lintian` within the `simulate` D-Bus method.
- The fix was included in the following versions of the `aptdaemon` package:
    - Ubuntu 15.04: 1.1.1+bzr982-0ubuntu3.1
    - Ubuntu 14.10: 1.1.1+bzr980-0ubuntu1.1
