[CVE-2015-1335](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6jr3-ph3x-8q66 "CVE-2015-1335"): Protect container mounts against symlinks

[Browse files](/lxc/lxc/tree/592fd47a6245508b79fe6ac819fe6d3b2c1289be)

```
When a container starts up, lxc sets up the container's inital fstree
by doing a bunch of mounting, guided by the container configuration
file.  The container config is owned by the admin or user on the host,
so we do not try to guard against bad entries.  However, since the
mount target is in the container, it's possible that the container admin
could divert the mount with symbolic links.  This could bypass proper
container startup (i.e. confinement of a root-owned container by the
restrictive apparmor policy, by diverting the required write to
/proc/self/attr/current), or bypass the (path-based) apparmor policy
by diverting, say, /proc to /mnt in the container.

To prevent this,

1. do not allow mounts to paths containing symbolic links

2. do not allow bind mounts from relative paths containing symbolic
links.

Details:

Define safe_mount which ensures that the container has not inserted any
symbolic links into any mount targets for mounts to be done during
container setup.

The host's mount path may contain symbolic links.  As it is under the
control of the administrator, that's ok.  So safe_mount begins the check
for symbolic links after the rootfs->mount, by opening that directory.

It opens each directory along the path using openat() relative to the
parent directory using O_NOFOLLOW.  When the target is reached, it
mounts onto /proc/self/fd/<targetfd>.

Use safe_mount() in mount_entry(), when mounting container proc,
and when needed.  In particular, safe_mount() need not be used in
any case where:

1. the mount is done in the container's namespace
2. the mount is for the container's rootfs
3. the mount is relative to a tmpfs or proc/sysfs which we have
   just safe_mount()ed ourselves

Since we were using proc/net as a temporary placeholder for /proc/sys/net
during container startup, and proc/net is a symbolic link, use proc/tty
instead.

Update the lxc.container.conf manpage with details about the new
restrictions.

Finally, add a testcase to test some symbolic link possibilities.

|  |  | NOTE - LXC will generally ensure that mount targets and relative |
|  |  | bind-mount sources are properly confined under the container |
|  |  | root, to avoid attacks involving over-mounting host directories |
|  |  | and files. (Symbolic links in absolute mount sources are ignored) |
|  |  | However, if the container configuration first mounts a directory which |
|  |  | is under the control of the container user, such as /home/joe, into |
|  |  | the container at some <filename>path</filename>, and then mounts |
|  |  | under <filename>path</filename>, then a TOCTTOU attack would be |
|  |  | possible where the container user modifies a symbolic link under |
|  |  | his home directory at just the right time. |

### Bug Description

lxc-start shuffles around mounts using helper directory /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc (guest root fs is mounted here)

It then modifies mounts operating in guest root directory before invoking init. As it does not check if all mount points are directories, a malicious guest may modify its internal structure before shutdown (or was created using manipulated image) and then when started again, guest may

I'm assuming this was using LXC 1.0, any chance you can check LXC 1.1?

We've deprecated pivotdir in LXC 1.1 for other reasons but that may very well prevent this entirely, if that's the case, then we can backport that change to LXC 1.0 minus the deprecation warning.

No, only tested on Ubuntu Trusty. I do not have other test machine at hand at the moment. Could you run

strace -s256 -f /bin/sh -c "/usr/bin/lxc-start --name [guestname]" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test.log

with a container where init is replaced with /bin/true (or just empty file) and send me the log?

The pivot\_root part looks more solid - the "." -> "." should make any symlink trickery with host / impossible here, the MS\_SLAVE should do the rest. But perhaps someone else may take a look ...

The apparmor modification may still work, I do not see major differences preventing it. Do you know of critical features allowed in lxc-start that would be disabled by standard container profile with that?

Indeed, this is still an issue. Sounds like the best way to fix this is:

 - Backport the pivot\_root change to the 1.0 branch (but without the deprecation warning, just silently ignore it)

 - Refuse to mount anything to a destination path which happens to be a symlink

Hi Serge - this patch looks good for the most part but I'm curious if it is possible for a container admin to modify the target path during or after the ensure\_not\_symlink() checks and before the mount? It feels like there's a TOCTOU issue in there but maybe the admin can't possibly make changes while the check is happening?

Yup, that race is there in theory. This appears to be yet another reason to push for a 'fdmount/mountat' function. But lacking that I'm not sure how we can prevent this.

Do you have any suggestions?

If we have the separate fix in apparmor for writing to /proc/self/attr/current, and the pivot\_root update backported, what other attacks remain meaningful here?

You could split all of the path components up into an array (or however

you want to iterate over them) and then walk each component of the path

like so:

for (component = components[0]; component; component++) {

  fd = open(dirfd, component,

            O\_CLOEXEC | O\_NOFOLLOW | O\_DIRECTORY | O\_RDONLY);

  fchdir(fd);

  close(dirfd);

  dirfd = fd;

}

close(fd);

mount(source, ".", ...);

Haha. I guess that works :) mount with '.' was escaping me - thanks!

Ah, right, the mount(".") doesn't work in the (very common) case of file mounts. We could special-case the file mount case to there chdir to the parent and then mount onto the filename, but that still allows for a TOCTTOU.

Ugh, I didn't think about bind mounting files. I can't think of any solutions for that scenario that would not require kernel changes.

Thanks for trying out the idea.

An alternative proposed patch which verifies that mounts were not on symlinks after the fact using /proc/self/mountinfo.

Since mounts are made in a private namespace and lxc has made every effort to first force all mounts to MS\_SLAVE, this should be safe. Upon failure, lxc will report an error and fail/stop the container startup.

Patch combining two approaches.

While it has the allure of trying all the harder to prevent symlinks, it also does result in more complicated code. I'm not sure which we should go with.

(Note that while the two original approaches were independently tested, this patch has not been tested. In fact the support for file mounts has not been tested even individually)

Hm, more problems with the chdir+mount approach - the susequent attempt to fix up readonly bind mounts results in

[pid 30540] mount(".", ".", 0x7fffca438669, MS\_RDONLY|MS\_REMOUNT|MS\_BIND, NULL) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

(with a fix to the posted patch to mount mountentry onto itself rather than fsname in the REMOUNT case)

So I'm really tempted to suggest going with the simpler patch in comment #17

Hi Serge - I've reviewed the patch against git HEAD and have a couple questions.

1) In mount\_entry(), the call to mount(2) is changed to use target as both the source and the destination. I can't see why this would be a valid change.

2) In is\_file\_mount(), the usage of lstat(2) seems odd for a couple reasons:

   - If path is a symlink to a directory, the mount will be incorrectly treated as a file mount in safe\_mount(). I think stat(2) should be used.

   - Error checking of lstat(2) is ignored. I think this should be treated as fatal for most (all?) cases.

3) In open\_without\_symlink(), why is curlen decremented after assigning it the return value of strlen(prefix\_skip)? Is it because prefix\_skip is somehow guaranteed to have a trailing '/' character?

4) open\_without\_symlink() is documented to return -1 upon error but it returns -EINVAL when target doesn't start with prefix\_skip. (minor)

5) Is there a need to protect against ".." components in open\_without\_symlink()? I'm thinking of a target of "/foo/../" and a prefix\_skip of "/foo".

It appears to me to be more correct. Since we are doing a remount,

the old source isn't really valid any more. I'm thinking of it in

terms of

mount --bind /ab /cd

 mount -o bind.remount,ro /cd

But I'll test with that part undone, and change it back, as I may just

not be thinking right.

Hm, yeah. I'll change that.

My tree has

ret = lstat(path, &sb);

 if (ret)

  return false;

Oh, you mean that if the lstat (or stat) fails, the whole safe\_mount()

should be aborted? That's probably a good thing to fix.

Hm, I don't think that's guaranteed.

The container admin cannot change the path being passed to

open\_without\_symlink() without having access to the container config

file, in which case he owns the host (or parent container) end of

story. But I think it's probably worth simply refusing any paths

with '..' in them, yes.

Aha! It didn't click with me that you are doing a remount there. If we

look at the mount(2) man page, under the MS\_REMOUNT section:

"target should be the same value specified in the initial mount() call;

source and filesystemtype are ignored."

I guess you could even pass in NULL for source and filesystemtype.

Yes, that's what I meant. At the moment, a return value of false could

mean that it isn't a file mount or that lstat(2) failed. Those feel like

two different conditions to me.

I understand that the right to modify the container config essentially

equals host root privs so I'm fine either way and will leave that

decision up to you.

The patch above still causes some regressions. The fix may be simple, but it's getting late.

The issue, I hope, is that we demand that we be able to inspect the mount target, to detect whether it is a symlink. This is more restrictive than 'mount' is. I can, from a non-init userns, mount a directory over /root even though i can't look at /root.

One of the failures I'm seeing is with $containerroot/proc/sysrq-trigger, which is

--w------- 1 root root 0 Sep 16 23:47 /proc/sysrq-trigger

Since a symbolic cannot have its permissions changed, I think we can assume that if we get EPERM on a final part of a link, we can allow the mount.

However, since we cannot then open the file/dir (to fchdir to or to mount onto /proc/self/fd), dealing with this complicates the whole thing.

We can detect the case where the last path element is unreadable, but

we can't then handle it using this technique. If we just detect that

case and then fall back to mount(src, dest, ...), then we are open to a

race where

a. first /home/$user was bind-mounted into the container at /foo

  b. then a mount is directed onto $containerroot/foo/a/b/c

  c. /home/$user/c is unreadable

  d. $user can redirect /home/$user/a/b to become an absolute symlink

     outside of the container (let's say /) after we've checked for

     absolute symlinks on /a/b but before we do the simple mount()

We'd need a way to use an fd to /a/b to prevent that from happening.

Perhaps we can chdir(/a/b) and then mount onto relative path 'c' ?

However c itself is still racy.

And so I'm leaning back toward doing the approach where we just blindly

do the mount, then check /proc/self/mountinfo or realpath() output to

verify that the mount was placed inside the container.

I think that the implementation of fusermount (file system in user space) had

similar problem, some code in this domain uses scheme, were process opens the

dir, chdirs in the other one and uses the /proc/self/fd elements in the mount

command.

This is even resistent to moving/deleting and recreating the directory in

between, but I'm not sure, if it could be applied here also.

@roma-fiedler,

I think what you describe is what my last patch was doing. The problem is we need to be able to mount files onto paths which we can' topen (i.e. /proc/sysrq-trigger). In that case I can't see a way to make sure that the path is not changed between our last check of it and the mount onto it.

Failing any good solution to that, I intend to switch out all that code in favor of code which just does the mount, then checks realpth() results to make sure the target ended up in the container directory. Since we are in a MS\_SLAVE remounted rootfs in a private mntns, there shouldn't be any downsides to that approach. Feedback very much appreciated.

A few minor comments on v2.

1) Typo in the commit message: "The host's mount path may container ..."

2) The function documentation for is\_subdir() needs updating to reflect the new params.

3) The fstatat() in the while loop of open\_without\_symlink() is not needed. open\_if\_safe() passes the O\_NOFOLLOW flag to openat(2) so symlinks are already being properly detected.

Thanks - updated to address those, and also removed the '..' check as discussed since we verify that the target doesn't escape the container rootfs. Uploading new tarball.

Also to me. If I understand correctly, code inside e.g. validate\_symlink is only secure when applied to a non-running container (where any process completely under guest control is launched). Otherwise there is TOCTOU between readlink and openat.

As the code is inside src/lxc/utils.c should we place comments before each of those functions, so that no one else will find them convenient, does not know about this implicit requirements and use it for something else.

"CAVEAT: This function must not be used for other purposes than container setup before executing the container's init?"

Apart from that, "validate\_symlink" using destbuf would work around that but could make the code more prone to endless recursions. (Was the patch already checked against symlink loops?)

Could the description of open\_without\_symlink be out of sync with code?

"Open a path intending for mounting, ensuring there are no symbolic links in the path anywhere after 'prefix\_skip' (if set)."

After checking the prefix, it calls open\_if\_safe which will validate\_symlink and use it, when symlink encountered?

I haven't checked the whole patch yet, would take hours, but perhaps someone could do two straces of container startup on patched machine (one normal and one with a problematic symlink) and I will try to do the same analysis as for the initial report according to methods from <https://service.ait.ac.at/security/2015/LxcSecurityAnalysis.html>

Could the description of open\_without\_symlink be out of sync with code?
"Open a path intending for mounting, ensuring there are no symbolic links in the path anywhere after 'prefix\_skip' (if set)."
After checking the prefix, it calls open\_if\_safe which will validate\_symlink and use it, when symlink encountered?
I haven't checked the whole patch yet, would take hours, but perhaps someone could do two straces of container startup on patched machine (one normal and one with a problematic symlink) and I will try to do the same analysis as for the initial report according to methods from https://service.ait.ac.at/security/2015/LxcSecurityAnalysis.html

The code is only run against non-running containers, however the symlinks

can be changed if the container configuration (under the host admin's

control) has two mount entries, the first bind-mounting the attacker's

homedir into the container, and the second mounting to someplace under

the bind-mounted home.

So the TOCTTOU between readlink and openat is a problem. Sigh.

We could re-check the readlink after the openat, but the attacker could

presumably try to very quickly move the link back...

So using destbuf may be better. If the target is also a link, simply

returning EPERM at that point should be ok. We're not trying to support

every possible configuration. The real cases we need to support are

things like /proc/net.

I'm REALLY feeling like just doing mount followed by a check of /proc/self/mountinfo would've been more robust.

After irc discussion we realized the patch was insufficient.

This new patch makes some changes. It forbids all symlinks in the mount target. The case for which this broke lxc before has been taken care of by not mounting onto proc/net (which is a symlink to proc/self/net). It also forbids symlinks in relative bind mount sources. If needed we can later add a mount option saying to allow symlinks, but since we allow symlinks for absolute source paths this may not be needed.

Chances are it is, but lxc in precise is in universe and on an unsupported upstream release, so we're not doing security updates there.

You can however use the upstream LXC PPA which will get you trusty's LXC on precise, including this security fix.

The problem lies in the ubuntu patch

<http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/lxc/lxc_1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5.debian.tar.gz>

where this code

+ size\_t start = croot ? strlen(croot) : 0;

+ ERROR("Mount onto %s resulted in %s\n", target, ws);

+ goto out;

in file 0003-CVE-2015-1335.patch checks if ws and start are the same.

According to the given error (which I forgot to paste above), ws and target ARE different:

So target is

/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc//proc

and ws is

/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/proc

Any hints how we could prevent the double slashing? Or would you just "clean up" the path somehow?

I have a similar problem (but not with /proc).

\*\*\*Roman Fielder's link (above) suggests the correct work around.\*\*\*

My lxc configuration file has the following line:

> lxc.mount.entry = /data/references /var/lib/lxc/noteServer/rootfs/data/references none ro,bind 0 0

(Note that the mount directory is an \*\*absolute\*\* path)

My resulting error message (in /var/log/lxc/noteServer.log) is:

> lxc-start 1443599663.225 ERROR lxc\_utils - utils.c:ensure\_not\_symlink:1384 - Mount onto /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc//data/references resulted in /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/data/references

Tracing through the apt-get source lxc code I think the offending code (in the mount\_entry\_on\_absolute\_rootfs function in the lxc-1.0.7/src/lxc/conf.c file) is:

> aux = strstr(mntent->mnt\_dir, path);

> if (aux) {

> offset = strlen(path);

> goto skipabs;

> }

>

> goto out;

> }

> offset = strlen(rootfs->path);

>

>skipabs:

>

> r = snprintf(path, MAXPATHLEN, "%s/%s", rootfs->mount,

> aux + offset);

Note that the last line should (probably -- I have not compiled any code to test this) be:

> r = snprintf(path, MAXPATHLEN, "%s/%s", rootfs->mount,

> aux + offset + 1);

The "+1" then skips over the "/" in the mntent->mnt\_dir so there will only be \*one\* "/" in the resulting path.

Note that the work around in Roman Fiedler's link ensures that the mount entry uses the mount\_entry\_on\_relative\_rootfs function (which works) rather than the (currently broken?) mount\_entry\_on\_absolute\_rootfs function.

I can confirm that the following configuration line:

> lxc.mount.entry = /data/references data/references none ro,bind 0 0

now in fact works, since it specifies a \*\*relative\*\* mount directory and so invokes the mount\_entry\_on\_relative\_rootfs function.

Many thanks for excellent \*\*open source\*\* tools!

We're using absolute mount targets here, so that might help. Will try this out.

\* Stéphane Graber's "LXC 1.0: Advanced container usage [3/10]" post ( <https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/21/lxc-1-0-advanced-container-usage/> ) makes use of the \*\*relative\*\* mount point (in the lxc-server's fstab config file on the host-server)

\* Unfortunately the \*\*official\*\*(?) Debian LXC wiki page on "LXC" has the topic "Bind mounts inside the container" ( <https://wiki.debian.org/LXC#Bind_mounts_inside_the_container> ) which uses the lxc.mount.entry line in the config file \*\*and\*\* makes use of an \*\*absolute\*\* mount point.

So those following the official Debian LXC documentation will be caught by this security patch. ;-(

Just to be definite: changing all lxc.mount.entry mount points to \*\*relative\*\* paths is a current workaround.

@Stephen Gaito and @Roman Fiedler:

Thanks for your hints! Using \*\*relative\*\* paths definitely helps also within the container fstab file.

However it would be very helpful if lxc would accept the absolute paths again:

fstab that fails with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:

/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINERNAME/rootfs/home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0

fstab that works with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:

/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0

I'm not so deep in LXC to know how the design/specification is done for that. Discussion of "features" might therefore suite the lxc-users mailing list better.

The other thing is, if Ubuntu would treat that part of new behaviour of LXC affecting some users as "regression" and hence might act on that. I do not know, who would be up to decide that. Perhaps someone from Ubuntu could comment on that.

Relative paths are definately recommended over absolute paths, but the breaking of absolute paths will be fixed.

Can anyone who's having trouble who is not on trusty please comment? I'd like to make sure that is the only problem.

The regression should be fixed with lxc 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6. See <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2753-2/> for more details.

Hi all,

today I worked on backporting available fixes for CVE-2015-1335 to LXC 0.7.x (as found in Debian squeeze-lts).

The patch is attached, I am still in the testing-for-regressions phase. Can any of the LXC devs take a look at the patch and maybe see if it is suitable for Ubuntu 12.04, as well?

Greets,

Mike (aka sunweaver at debian.org)

Hi,

So the thing to look for is any unconverted "mount" calls. It

looks like the lxc\_setup\_fs() calls to mount\_fs() are not being

protected. So the contianer admin could attack through a /proc

symlink.

Hi Serge,

sorry for getting back to this so late.

Hmmm... ok...

I just checked upstream Git and the location you refer to is not using

safe\_mount either there [1]

Furthermore, it seems non-trivial to inform safe\_mount about the root

path from within lxc\_init.c.

Do you have any input on the following questions?:

o Why mount\_fs() in latest HEAD still using the mount() call

instead of safe\_mount()?

   o How could one pipe the rootfs path into lxc\_setup\_fs() -> mount\_fs()?

Thanks for any input.

Mike

Huh, that's odd. Yes those should be protected, since /proc etc in

the container could be symlinks. Do you mind sending a patch?

You shouldn't need to - it's just '/' because you're already chrooted

there.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=946744#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-09-21 14:13:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 648268](attachment.cgi?id=648268&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=648268&action=edit "patch") patch  A private security bug was reported by Roman Fiedler against LXC.  The issue is embargoed and has not been disclosed publicly. We are requesting a coordinated release date (CRD) of <2015-09-29 14:00:00 UTC>. We ask that you keep this issue embargoed until the CRD[1]. If nobody requests another date, Ubuntu and upstream LXC will make the issue public on the CRD.  CVE-2015-1335 (<https://launchpad.net/bugs/1476662>) is a directory traversal flaw that can occur while lxc-start is initially setting up the mounts for a container.  If an attacker constructs a malicious symlink in the target path of a container mount point, the symlink could be mishandled the next time the container is started and the mount operation may be performed at an undesired target location.  Additionally, if the source path of the mount is a malicious symlink relative to the container, the symlink could be mishandled to bind mount an undesired file or directory into the container.  Direct modification of the host's mount table is not possible since a slave copy of the mount table is used.  An example of an attack that is made possible by this flaw is a user inside of the container could leave behind a malicious symlink, at a mount point target under their control, that would cause /proc/self/attr to be mounted over. lxc-start would then unknowingly write to a "fake" /proc/self/attr/current file, prior to launching the container init, to perform an AppArmor profile transition. The profile transition would not occur and the container init would run under incorrect confinement.  I've attached the fix from upstream LXC which applies against their git master branch. Backported patches against the 1.1 and 1.0 trees will be available upon request.  Tyler  [1] Please do not release a fix, make public revision control commits,     comment in public bug reports or otherwise disclose information     about this issue until the coordinated release date. This gives all     affected parties a chance to release a fix at the same time. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=946744#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-09-21 22:00:26 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=946744#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-01 12:37:26 UTC  ``` On OSS-sec: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/648>  Fix commit: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/592fd47a6245508b79fe6ac819fe6d3b2c1289be>  Upstream announcement: <https://lists.linuxcontainers.org/pipermail/lxc-devel/2015-September/012434.html>  More analysis: <https://service.ait.ac.at/security/2015/LxcSecurityAnalysis.html>  The patch does not apply cleanly to 0.6.5,0.7.5,0.8.0 used in production.

Package        : lxc
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1335
Debian Bug     : 800471

Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC, the Linux
Containers userspace tools. A local attacker with access to a LXC
container could exploit this flaw to run programs inside the container
that are not confined by AppArmor or expose unintended files in the host
to the container.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.

From: Serge Hallyn

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Protect container mounts against symlinks
When a container starts up, lxc sets up the container's inital fstree
by doing a bunch of mounting, guided by the container configuration
file. The container config is owned by the admin or user on the host,
so we do not try to guard against bad entries. However, since the
mount target is in the container, it's possible that the container admin
could divert the mount with symbolic links. This could bypass proper
container startup (i.e. confinement of a root-owned container by the
restrictive apparmor policy, by diverting the required write to
/proc/self/attr/current), or bypass the (path-based) apparmor policy
by diverting, say, /proc to /mnt in the container.
To prevent this,
1. do not allow mounts to paths containing symbolic links
2. do not allow bind mounts from relative paths containing symbolic
links.
Details:
This patch causes lxc to check /proc/self/mountinfo after each
mount into a container rootfs (that is, where we are not chrooted
into the container), making sure that the mount target wasn't a
symlink.
Use safe\_mount() in mount\_file\_entries(), when mounting container proc,
and when needed. In particular, safe\_mount() need not be used in
any case where:
1. the mount is done in the container's namespace
2. the mount is for the container's rootfs
3. the mount is relative to a tmpfs or proc/sysfs which we have
just safe\_mount()ed ourselves
Since we were using proc/net as a temporary placeholder for /proc/sys/net
during container startup, and proc/net is a symbolic link, use proc/tty
instead.
Update the lxc.container.conf manpage with details about the new
restrictions.
Finally, add a testcase to test some symbolic link possibilities.
lxc-test-symlink: background lxc-start
CVE-2015-1335
Notes on the 0.7.x backport (for Debian squeeze-lts)
\* Debian squeeze ships Linux 2.6.32 which lacks O\_PATH flaf support in
openat(). Thus, for the safe\_mount implementation we use an approach
that got also used in lxc for Ubuntu trusty: do bind mount and afterwards
check if it was mounted onto a symlink. If so, immediately unmount again.
\* LXC 0.7.x does not have a test suite, so the test case was omitted.

+ NOTE - LXC will generally ensure that mount targets and relative

# USN-2753-1: LXC vulnerability

29 September 2015

LXC could be made to start containers without AppArmor confinement or access
the host filesystem.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [lxc](/security/cves?package=lxc) - Linux Containers userspace tools

## Details

Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local

attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run

programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose

unintended files in the host to the container.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [lxc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc)
  -
  [1.1.2-0ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc/1.1.2-0ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [lxc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc)
  -
  [1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc/1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

### Bug Description

lxc-start shuffles around mounts using helper directory /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc (guest root fs is mounted here)

It then modifies mounts operating in guest root directory before invoking init. As it does not check if all mount points are directories, a malicious guest may modify its internal structure before shutdown (or was created using manipulated image) and then when started again, guest may

\* Access the whole host root filesystem

\* Block switching from lxc-start apparmor profile to lxc-container-default

I'm assuming this was using LXC 1.0, any chance you can check LXC 1.1?

We've deprecated pivotdir in LXC 1.1 for other reasons but that may very well prevent this entirely, if that's the case, then we can backport that change to LXC 1.0 minus the deprecation warning.

No, only tested on Ubuntu Trusty. I do not have other test machine at hand at the moment. Could you run

strace -s256 -f /bin/sh -c "/usr/bin/lxc-start --name [guestname]" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test.log

with a container where init is replaced with /bin/true (or just empty file) and send me the log?

The pivot\_root part looks more solid - the "." -> "." should make any symlink trickery with host / impossible here, the MS\_SLAVE should do the rest. But perhaps someone else may take a look ...

The apparmor modification may still work, I do not see major differences preventing it. Do you know of critical features allowed in lxc-start that would be disabled by standard container profile with that?

Indeed, this is still an issue. Sounds like the best way to fix this is:

 - Backport the pivot\_root change to the 1.0 branch (but without the deprecation warning, just silently ignore it)

 - Refuse to mount anything to a destination path which happens to be a symlink

Hi Serge - this patch looks good for the most part but I'm curious if it is possible for a container admin to modify the target path during or after the ensure\_not\_symlink() checks and before the mount? It feels like there's a TOCTOU issue in there but maybe the admin can't possibly make changes while the check is happening?

Yup, that race is there in theory. This appears to be yet another reason to push for a 'fdmount/mountat' function. But lacking that I'm not sure how we can prevent this.

Do you have any suggestions?

If we have the separate fix in apparmor for writing to /proc/self/attr/current, and the pivot\_root update backported, what other attacks remain meaningful here?

You could split all of the path components up into an array (or however

you want to iterate over them) and then walk each component of the path

like so:

for (component = components[0]; component; component++) {

  fd = open(dirfd, component,

            O\_CLOEXEC | O\_NOFOLLOW | O\_DIRECTORY | O\_RDONLY);

  fchdir(fd);

  close(dirfd);

  dirfd = fd;

}

close(fd);

mount(source, ".", ...);

Ah, right, the mount(".") doesn't work in the (very common) case of file mounts. We could special-case the file mount case to there chdir to the parent and then mount onto the filename, but that still allows for a TOCTTOU.

An alternative proposed patch which verifies that mounts were not on symlinks after the fact using /proc/self/mountinfo.

Since mounts are made in a private namespace and lxc has made every effort to first force all mounts to MS\_SLAVE, this should be safe. Upon failure, lxc will report an error and fail/stop the container startup.

Patch combining two approaches.

While it has the allure of trying all the harder to prevent symlinks, it also does result in more complicated code. I'm not sure which we should go with.

(Note that while the two original approaches were independently tested, this patch has not been tested. In fact the support for file mounts has not been tested even individually)

Hm, more problems with the chdir+mount approach - the susequent attempt to fix up readonly bind mounts results in

[pid 30540] mount(".", ".", 0x7fffca438669, MS\_RDONLY|MS\_REMOUNT|MS\_BIND, NULL) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

(with a fix to the posted patch to mount mountentry onto itself rather than fsname in the REMOUNT case)

So I'm really tempted to suggest going with the simpler patch in comment #17

Hi Serge - I've reviewed the patch against git HEAD and have a couple questions.

1) In mount\_entry(), the call to mount(2) is changed to use target as both the source and the destination. I can't see why this would be a valid change.

2) In is\_file\_mount(), the usage of lstat(2) seems odd for a couple reasons:

   - If path is a symlink to a directory, the mount will be incorrectly treated as a file mount in safe\_mount(). I think stat(2) should be used.

   - Error checking of lstat(2) is ignored. I think this should be treated as fatal for most (all?) cases.

3) In open\_without\_symlink(), why is curlen decremented after assigning it the return value of strlen(prefix\_skip)? Is it because prefix\_skip is somehow guaranteed to have a trailing '/' character?

4) open\_without\_symlink() is documented to return -1 upon error but it returns -EINVAL when target doesn't start with prefix\_skip. (minor)

5) Is there a need to protect against ".." components in open\_without\_symlink()? I'm thinking of a target of "/foo/../" and a prefix\_skip of "/foo".

It appears to me to be more correct. Since we are doing a remount,

the old source isn't really valid any more. I'm thinking of it in

terms of

mount --bind /ab /cd

 mount -o bind.remount,ro /cd

But I'll test with that part undone, and change it back, as I may just

not be thinking right.

Hm, yeah. I'll change that.

My tree has

ret = lstat(path, &sb);

 if (ret)

  return false;

Oh, you mean that if the lstat (or stat) fails, the whole safe\_mount()

should be aborted? That's probably a good thing to fix.

Hm, I don't think that's guaranteed.

The container admin cannot change the path being passed to

open\_without\_symlink() without having access to the container config

file, in which case he owns the host (or parent container) end of

story. But I think it's probably worth simply refusing any paths

with '..' in them, yes.

Aha! It didn't click with me that you are doing a remount there. If we

look at the mount(2) man page, under the MS\_REMOUNT section:

"target should be the same value specified in the initial mount() call;

source and filesystemtype are ignored."

I guess you could even pass in NULL for source and filesystemtype.

Yes, that's what I meant. At the moment, a return value of false could

mean that it isn't a file mount or that lstat(2) failed. Those feel like

two different conditions to me.

I understand that the right to modify the container config essentially

equals host root privs so I'm fine either way and will leave that

decision up to you.

The patch above still causes some regressions. The fix may be simple, but it's getting late.

The issue, I hope, is that we demand that we be able to inspect the mount target, to detect whether it is a symlink. This is more restrictive than 'mount' is. I can, from a non-init userns, mount a directory over /root even though i can't look at /root.

One of the failures I'm seeing is with $containerroot/proc/sysrq-trigger, which is

--w------- 1 root root 0 Sep 16 23:47 /proc/sysrq-trigger

Since a symbolic cannot have its permissions changed, I think we can assume that if we get EPERM on a final part of a link, we can allow the mount.

However, since we cannot then open the file/dir (to fchdir to or to mount onto /proc/self/fd), dealing with this complicates the whole thing.

We can detect the case where the last path element is unreadable, but

we can't then handle it using this technique. If we just detect that

case and then fall back to mount(src, dest, ...), then we are open to a

race where

a. first /home/$user was bind-mounted into the container at /foo

  b. then a mount is directed onto $containerroot/foo/a/b/c

  c. /home/$user/c is unreadable

  d. $user can redirect /home/$user/a/b to become an absolute symlink

     outside of the container (let's say /) after we've checked for

     absolute symlinks on /a/b but before we do the simple mount()

We'd need a way to use an fd to /a/b to prevent that from happening.

Perhaps we can chdir(/a/b) and then mount onto relative path 'c' ?

However c itself is still racy.

And so I'm leaning back toward doing the approach where we just blindly

do the mount, then check /proc/self/mountinfo or realpath() output to

verify that the mount was placed inside the container.

I think that the implementation of fusermount (file system in user space) had

similar problem, some code in this domain uses scheme, were process opens the

dir, chdirs in the other one and uses the /proc/self/fd elements in the mount

command.

This is even resistent to moving/deleting and recreating the directory in

between, but I'm not sure, if it could be applied here also.

@roma-fiedler,

I think what you describe is what my last patch was doing. The problem is we need to be able to mount files onto paths which we can' topen (i.e. /proc/sysrq-trigger). In that case I can't see a way to make sure that the path is not changed between our last check of it and the mount onto it.

Failing any good solution to that, I intend to switch out all that code in favor of code which just does the mount, then checks realpth() results to make sure the target ended up in the container directory. Since we are in a MS\_SLAVE remounted rootfs in a private mntns, there shouldn't be any downsides to that approach. Feedback very much appreciated.

A few minor comments on v2.

1) Typo in the commit message: "The host's mount path may container ..."

2) The function documentation for is\_subdir() needs updating to reflect the new params.

3) The fstatat() in the while loop of open\_without\_symlink() is not needed. open\_if\_safe() passes the O\_NOFOLLOW flag to openat(2) so symlinks are already being properly detected.

Thanks - updated to address those, and also removed the '..' check as discussed since we verify that the target doesn't escape the container rootfs. Uploading new tarball.

Also to me. If I understand correctly, code inside e.g. validate\_symlink is only secure when applied to a non-running container (where any process completely under guest control is launched). Otherwise there is TOCTOU between readlink and openat.

As the code is inside src/lxc/utils.c should we place comments before each of those functions, so that no one else will find them convenient, does not know about this implicit requirements and use it for something else.

"CAVEAT: This function must not be used for other purposes than container setup before executing the container's init?"

Apart from that, "validate\_symlink" using destbuf would work around that but could make the code more prone to endless recursions. (Was the patch already checked against symlink loops?)

Could the description of open\_without\_symlink be out of sync with code?

"Open a path intending for mounting, ensuring there are no symbolic links in the path anywhere after 'prefix\_skip' (if set)."

After checking the prefix, it calls open\_if\_safe which will validate\_symlink and use it, when symlink encountered?

I haven't checked the whole patch yet, would take hours, but perhaps someone could do two straces of container startup on patched machine (one normal and one with a problematic symlink) and I will try to do the same analysis as for the initial report according to methods from <https://service.ait.ac.at/security/2015/LxcSecurityAnalysis.html>

The code is only run against non-running containers, however the symlinks

can be changed if the container configuration (under the host admin's

control) has two mount entries, the first bind-mounting the attacker's

homedir into the container, and the second mounting to someplace under

the bind-mounted home.

So the TOCTTOU between readlink and openat is a problem. Sigh.

We could re-check the readlink after the openat, but the attacker could

presumably try to very quickly move the link back...

So using destbuf may be better. If the target is also a link, simply

returning EPERM at that point should be ok. We're not trying to support

every possible configuration. The real cases we need to support are

things like /proc/net.

So using destbuf may be better. If the target is also a link, simply
returning EPERM at that point should be ok. We're not trying to support
every possible configuration. The real cases we need to support are
things like /proc/net.

I'm REALLY feeling like just doing mount followed by a check of /proc/self/mountinfo would've been more robust.

After irc discussion we realized the patch was insufficient.

This new patch makes some changes. It forbids all symlinks in the mount target. The case for which this broke lxc before has been taken care of by not mounting onto proc/net (which is a symlink to proc/self/net). It also forbids symlinks in relative bind mount sources. If needed we can later add a mount option saying to allow symlinks, but since we allow symlinks for absolute source paths this may not be needed.

Chances are it is, but lxc in precise is in universe and on an unsupported upstream release, so we're not doing security updates there.

You can however use the upstream LXC PPA which will get you trusty's LXC on precise, including this security fix.

The problem lies in the ubuntu patch

<http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/lxc/lxc_1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5.debian.tar.gz>

where this code

+ size\_t start = croot ? strlen(croot) : 0;

+ if (strcmp(ws + start, target + start) != 0) {

+ ERROR("Mount onto %s resulted in %s\n", target, ws);

+ goto out;

+ }

in file 0003-CVE-2015-1335.patch checks if ws and start are the same.

According to the given error (which I forgot to paste above), ws and target ARE different:

lxc-start: utils.c: ensure\_not\_symlink: 1384 Mount onto /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc//proc resulted in /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/proc

So target is

/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc//proc

and ws is

/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/proc

Any hints how we could prevent the double slashing? Or would you just "clean up" the path somehow?

I have a similar problem (but not with /proc).

\*\*\*Roman Fielder's link (above) suggests the correct work around.\*\*\*

My lxc configuration file has the following line:

> lxc.mount.entry = /data/references /var/lib/lxc/noteServer/rootfs/data/references none ro,bind 0 0

(Note that the mount directory is an \*\*absolute\*\* path)

My resulting error message (in /var/log/lxc/noteServer.log) is:

> lxc-start 1443599663.225 ERROR lxc\_utils - utils.c:ensure\_not\_symlink:1384 - Mount onto /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc//data/references resulted in /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/data/references

Tracing through the apt-get source lxc code I think the offending code (in the mount\_entry\_on\_absolute\_rootfs function in the lxc-1.0.7/src/lxc/conf.c file) is:

> aux = strstr(mntent->mnt\_dir, path);

> if (aux) {

> offset = strlen(path);

> goto skipabs;

> }

>

>skipvarlib:

> aux = strstr(mntent->mnt\_dir, rootfs->path);

> WARN("ignoring mount point '%s'", mntent->mnt\_dir);

> goto out;

> }

> offset = strlen(rootfs->path);

>

>skipabs:

>

> r = snprintf(path, MAXPATHLEN, "%s/%s", rootfs->mount,

> aux + offset);

Note that the last line should (probably -- I have not compiled any code to test this) be:

> r = snprintf(path, MAXPATHLEN, "%s/%s", rootfs->mount,

> aux + offset + 1);

The "+1" then skips over the "/" in the mntent->mnt\_dir so there will only be \*one\* "/" in the resulting path.

Note that the work around in Roman Fiedler's link ensures that the mount entry uses the mount\_entry\_on\_relative\_rootfs function (which works) rather than the (currently broken?) mount\_entry\_on\_absolute\_rootfs function.

I can confirm that the following configuration line:

> lxc.mount.entry = /data/references data/references none ro,bind 0 0

now in fact works, since it specifies a \*\*relative\*\* mount directory and so invokes the mount\_entry\_on\_relative\_rootfs function.

Many thanks for excellent \*\*open source\*\* tools!

We're using absolute mount targets here, so that might help. Will try this out.

Looking through the top Google results on how to bind-mount a directory from the host-server into the lxc-server I notice that:

\* Stéphane Graber's "LXC 1.0: Advanced container usage [3/10]" post ( <https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/21/lxc-1-0-advanced-container-usage/> ) makes use of the \*\*relative\*\* mount point (in the lxc-server's fstab config file on the host-server)

\* Unfortunately the \*\*official\*\*(?) Debian LXC wiki page on "LXC" has the topic "Bind mounts inside the container" ( <https://wiki.debian.org/LXC#Bind_mounts_inside_the_container> ) which uses the lxc.mount.entry line in the config file \*\*and\*\* makes use of an \*\*absolute\*\* mount point.

So those following the official Debian LXC documentation will be caught by this security patch. ;-(

Just to be definite: changing all lxc.mount.entry mount points to \*\*relative\*\* paths is a current workaround.

@Stephen Gaito and @Roman Fiedler:

Thanks for your hints! Using \*\*relative\*\* paths definitely helps also within the container fstab file.

However it would be very helpful if lxc would accept the absolute paths again:

fstab that fails with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:

/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINERNAME/rootfs/home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0

fstab that works with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:

/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0

However it would be very helpful if lxc would accept the absolute paths again:
fstab that fails with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:
/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINERNAME/rootfs/home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0
fstab that works with 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5:
/home/MYUSER/somemountpoint home/MYUSER none defaults,bind 0 0

I'm not so deep in LXC to know how the design/specification is done for that. Discussion of "features" might therefore suite the lxc-users mailing list better.

The other thing is, if Ubuntu would treat that part of new behaviour of LXC affecting some users as "regression" and hence might act on that. I do not know, who would be up to decide that. Perhaps someone from Ubuntu could comment on that.

Relative paths are definately recommended over absolute paths, but the breaking of absolute paths will be fixed.

Can anyone who's having trouble who is not on trusty please comment? I'd like to make sure that is the only problem.

The regression should be fixed with lxc 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6. See <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2753-2/> for more details.

Hi all,

today I worked on backporting available fixes for CVE-2015-1335 to LXC 0.7.x (as found in Debian squeeze-lts).

The patch is attached, I am still in the testing-for-regressions phase. Can any of the LXC devs take a look at the patch and maybe see if it is suitable for Ubuntu 12.04, as well?

Greets,

Mike (aka sunweaver at debian.org)

Hi,

So the thing to look for is any unconverted "mount" calls. It

looks like the lxc\_setup\_fs() calls to mount\_fs() are not being

protected. So the contianer admin could attack through a /proc

symlink.

Hmmm... ok...

I just checked upstream Git and the location you refer to is not using

safe\_mount either there [1]

Furthermore, it seems non-trivial to inform safe\_mount about the root

path from within lxc\_init.c.

Do you have any input on the following questions?:

o Why mount\_fs() in latest HEAD still using the mount() call

instead of safe\_mount()?

   o How could one pipe the rootfs path into lxc\_setup\_fs() -> mount\_fs()?

Thanks for any input.

Mike

Huh, that's odd. Yes those should be protected, since /proc etc in

the container could be symlinks. Do you mind sending a patch?

You shouldn't need to - it's just '/' because you're already chrooted

there.

I will work on the squeeze-lts / precise patch first and test that. If

that works well, I will forward-port the change to current HEAD.

Ok. That will make it very easy.

I get back to you with results within the month.

From 3c62cae308e8e66dcc616c5bd34671e1d2eea5a6 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Serge Hallyn

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Protect container mounts against symlinks
When a container starts up, lxc sets up the container's inital fstree
by doing a bunch of mounting, guided by the container configuration
file. The container config is owned by the admin or user on the host,
so we do not try to guard against bad entries. However, since the
mount target is in the container, it's possible that the container admin
could divert the mount with symbolic links. This could bypass proper
container startup (i.e. confinement of a root-owned container by the
restrictive apparmor policy, by diverting the required write to
/proc/self/attr/current), or bypass the (path-based) apparmor policy
by diverting, say, /proc to /mnt in the container.
To prevent this,
1. do not allow mounts to paths containing symbolic links
2. do not allow bind mounts from relative paths containing symbolic
links.
Details:
This patch causes lxc to check /proc/self/mountinfo after each
mount into a container rootfs (that is, where we are not chrooted
into the container), making sure that the mount target wasn't a
symlink.
Use safe\_mount() in mount\_file\_entries(), when mounting container proc,
and when needed. In particular, safe\_mount() need not be used in
any case where:
1. the mount is done in the container's namespace
2. the mount is for the container's rootfs
3. the mount is relative to a tmpfs or proc/sysfs which we have
just safe\_mount()ed ourselves
Since we were using proc/net as a temporary placeholder for /proc/sys/net
during container startup, and proc/net is a symbolic link, use proc/tty
instead.
Update the lxc.container.conf manpage with details about the new
restrictions.
Finally, add a testcase to test some symbolic link possibilities.
lxc-test-symlink: background lxc-start
CVE-2015-1335
Notes on the 0.7.x backport (for Debian squeeze-lts)
\* Debian squeeze ships Linux 2.6.32 which lacks O\_PATH flaf support in
openat(). Thus, for the safe\_mount implementation we use an approach
that got also used in lxc for Ubuntu trusty: do bind mount and afterwards
check if it was mounted onto a symlink. If so, immediately unmount again.
\* LXC 0.7.x does not have a test suite, so the test case was omitted.

security vulnerability in LXC.

CVE 2015-1335:
    When a container starts up, lxc sets up the container's inital fstree
    by doing a bunch of mounting, guided by the container configuration
    file.  The container config is owned by the admin or user on the host,
    so we do not try to guard against bad entries.  However, since the
    mount target is in the container, it's possible that the container admin
    could divert the mount with symbolic links.  This could bypass proper
    container startup (i.e. confinement of a root-owned container by the
    restrictive apparmor policy, by diverting the required write to
    /proc/self/attr/current), or bypass the (path-based) apparmor policy
    by diverting, say, /proc to /mnt in the container.

    To prevent this,
    1. do not allow mounts to paths containing symbolic links
    2. do not allow bind mounts from relative paths containing symbolic
    links.

    The fix for LXC 1.0 is:
    <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/6bbb8100c4dec4b1c71758c27104985a694a4eac>

    The fix for LXC 1.1 is:
    <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/6de26af93d3dd87c8b21a42fdf20f30fa1c1948d>

    The fix for LXC master is:
    <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/592fd47a6245508b79fe6ac819fe6d3b2c1289be>

    Patches for a few recent LXC releases are also attached to this e-mail.

The fix will be included in the upcoming stable releases for both
branches. That will be LXC 1.1.4 and LXC 1.0.8 which will both be
released very soon.

The security teams from the various Linux distributions have been
informed of those security issues ahead of time and so should have or
soon will be pushing security updates to their supported releases.

I'd like to thank Roman for his great work at finding and responsibly
disclosing those issues to us.

The fix for this issue has been developed by Serge Hallyn with the help
of Tyler Hicks and myself.

# CVE-2019-5736

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5721.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-5737.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5736 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5736)

#### Description

runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.
