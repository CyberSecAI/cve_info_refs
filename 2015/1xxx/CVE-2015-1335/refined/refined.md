Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `lxc-start` handles mount targets and bind mount sources during container startup. Specifically, it fails to properly check for and prevent symbolic links in these paths when mounting filesystems, which allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Symlink Attack on Mount Targets:** Local container administrators can create symbolic links at mount points within the container's filesystem. When `lxc-start` attempts to mount a new filesystem over this path, it follows the symlink and mounts at the symlink destination, potentially leading to mounting over an arbitrary location on the host system.
2.  **Symlink Attack on Bind Mount Sources:** Similarly, if the source path for a bind mount is a symbolic link that is relative to the container's filesystem, the container administrator can manipulate this path to mount an unintended file or directory from the host into the container.
3.  **Missing netns ownership check:** `lxc-user-nic` lacks proper checks on ownership for the network namespace, enabling local users with a `lxc-usernet` allocation to create network interfaces and arbitrarily name them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AppArmor/SELinux Confinement Escape:** By mounting `/proc/self/attr/current` over a malicious symlink, attackers can bypass AppArmor or SELinux profile transitions intended to confine the container, allowing the container init process to run with incorrect confinement.
*   **Host Filesystem Access:** Attackers can gain access to arbitrary locations within the host filesystem, potentially reading sensitive files or modifying critical configurations.
*   **Arbitrary network interface creation**: Attackers can create network interfaces on the host with arbitrary names.
*   **Side effects on host via kernel file reads:** Attackers can trigger side effects by causing a (read-only) open of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack requires local access, meaning the attacker needs to be able to run commands within an LXC container, either as a root or a user with `lxc-usernet` allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Container Administrator:** The attacker must be able to manipulate mount points, and relative bind mount sources within an LXC container.
*   **Privileged user in container or `lxc-usernet` allocation**: The attacker can execute commands with root privileges inside an existing or new container or can use `lxc-user-nic` to create network interfaces on the host.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `lxc-start` utility and how it sets up the container's filesystem tree through various mount operations guided by the container's configuration file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a container administrator places symlinks within a container filesystem, which are then traversed when `lxc-start` tries to set up mounts.
*   The fixes involve checks to ensure that mount targets and relative bind-mount sources do not contain symbolic links. `safe_mount()` was introduced to ensure that container has not inserted any symbolic links into any mount targets for mounts to be done during container setup
*   For cases where checking of symbolic links is not possible before mount, checks are done after the mount via `/proc/self/mountinfo` to ensure that the target is still under the container root.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also discusses the fixes, backporting, and regressions in various versions of LXC. It also highlights discussions among developers on how to prevent Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions when checking and applying mounts.
*   The fix in `lxc 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.5` introduced a regression due to double slashes in the path, which was subsequently fixed in `lxc 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6`.
*   There are also references to discussions of using absolute vs relative mount paths and the security issues with absolute mount paths.
