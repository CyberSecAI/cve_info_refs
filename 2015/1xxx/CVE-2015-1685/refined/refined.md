Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer failing to properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This failure makes it easier for attackers to predict the memory offsets of specific instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The core weakness is the bypass of the ASLR security feature. This doesn't directly cause code execution but reduces the effectiveness of a key protection mechanism against memory-based attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Enables Reliable Exploitation:** While the ASLR bypass doesn't directly allow code execution, it significantly lowers the difficulty for attackers to leverage other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution (RCE) flaws. By bypassing ASLR, attackers can more reliably execute malicious code on a target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious website. An attacker would need to host a website designed to exploit the ASLR bypass. The victim must then browse to this malicious site using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised/User-provided Content:** Attackers could also exploit compromised websites or those that allow user-provided content by injecting malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Hosting:** Attackers need to host a malicious website.
- **User Interaction:** They require a user to visit the malicious website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. There is no way to force a user to visit the site; the attacker must rely on deception or other methods to lure the victim to the malicious site.
