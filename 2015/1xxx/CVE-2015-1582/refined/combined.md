Smashing plugin although not one for beginners. The Web Dorado team were great at helping me get this set up (I bought the plugin) and it works just fine for what I need. Thank you

Oui, cette extension est superbement bien conçu. Merci au concepteur.
Je regrette qu’une chose, c’est que le texte qui indique ceux qui aiment ne sois plus traduit en français.
Extension très pratique.
Merci

Great plugin! It has all the social integration features that a modern site needs. No need to download 100 plugins to integrate the website with facebook. I’m using this free version on my site and considering to buy the pro version soon for one of my client’s sites.
