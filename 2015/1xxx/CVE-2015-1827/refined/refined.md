{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The IPA extdom Directory Server plug-in did not correctly perform memory reallocation when handling user account information. Specifically, the `getgrgid_r()` function's buffer was not resized when needed, resulting in a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory reallocation",
      "Insufficient buffer size for `getgrgid_r()` call"
    ],
    "impact": "A request for a list of groups for a user that belongs to a large number of groups would cause the Directory Server to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network request to IPA server requesting user group list"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send a request to an IPA server"

  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was triggered when requesting group information for a user that is a member of a large number of groups.  The fix implements a gradual increase of the buffer size for the `getgrgid_r()` function call, handling the `ERANGE` return code. The `nss` buffer size is now configurable."
