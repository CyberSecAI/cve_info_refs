The provided documents contain information about CVE-2015-1170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The NVIDIA Display Driver's kernel administrator check improperly validates local client impersonation levels in some cases.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of local client impersonation levels
- Vulnerable NVIDIA GPU Display Driver components in Windows systems

**Impact of exploitation:**
Elevation of privileges, allowing a local user to gain access to resources intended for local administrators, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. An attacker with local access can exploit the improper impersonation behavior of NVIDIA driver APIs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have local access on the machine, and the user/process needs to be running with administrator privileges to allow impersonation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various Windows versions (XP, Vista, 7, Server 2008/2008 R2) using NVIDIA GPU display driver components.
*   HP also released security bulletins regarding this issue affecting their PCs/Workstations and Servers using the vulnerable NVIDIA drivers
*   The vulnerability was reported to NVIDIA by James Forshaw from Google Project Zero
*   NVIDIA recommends updating to a patched driver for the specific platform.
*   Mitigation strategies include using safe computing practices (downloading from trusted sources, running with least privileges, avoiding unnecessary elevation of UAC).
