  "CVE-2015-1748": {
    "description": "Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.",
    "root_cause": "Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Elevation of privilege"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A web-based attack scenario, where an attacker could host a website used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
      "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to convince users to take action, such as clicking a link to an attacker-controlled site."
    ],
    "additional_info": "This vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-03-18 and publicly disclosed on 2015-06-11. This vulnerability is related to the usage of res:// and Windows Help Engine. By running specially crafted JavaScript, a 32-bit medium integrity process can be spawned. By injecting privileged javascript into this process, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of a medium integrity process.",
        "affected_products": [
            "Internet Explorer 7",
            "Internet Explorer 8",
            "Internet Explorer 9",
            "Internet Explorer 10",
            "Internet Explorer 11"
