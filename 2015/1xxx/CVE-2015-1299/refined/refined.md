  "CVE-2015-1299": {
    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the shared-timer implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging erroneous timer firing, related to ThreadTimers.cpp and Timer.cpp.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the shared-timer implementation within the Blink rendering engine.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability stems from improper management of timer objects in the shared-timer implementation, leading to a use-after-free condition when a timer fires erroneously."
       ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, or potentially other unspecified impacts, including arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered via network, by loading malicious content that causes timers to fire in an erroneous state."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious web page/app/extension that exploits the incorrect timer handling in Blink's shared-timer implementation.  No authentication is required and attack complexity is low.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability affects the shared-timer implementation in Blink's `ThreadTimers.cpp` and `Timer.cpp` files. Patches for affected products upgrade Chromium to version 45.0.2454.85, addressing the root cause and mitigating exploitation."
