page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1291, CVE-2015-1292, CVE-2015-1293, CVE-2015-1294,
CVE-2015-1295, CVE-2015-1296, CVE-2015-1297, CVE-2015-1298, CVE-2015-1299,
CVE-2015-1300, CVE-2015-1301)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 45.0.2454.85, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

# CVE-2015-1296

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1295.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1297.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1296 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1296)

#### Description

The UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl implementation in net/base/escape.cc in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not prevent display of Unicode LOCK characters in the omnibox, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof the SSL lock icon by placing one of these characters at the end of a URL, as demonstrated by the omnibox in localizations for right-to-left languages.

## Issue [956333002](/956333002/): Refactor TimeBase to post tasks. Workers to use real Idle tasks. (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 10 months ago by [alex clarke (OOO till 29th)](/user/alex%20clarke%20%28OOO%20till%2029th%29)  **Modified:** 5 years, 6 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Sami](/user/Sami), [rmcilroy](/user/rmcilroy)  **CC:** rmcilroy\_chromium.org blink-reviews, kinuko+worker\_chromium.org, horo+watch\_chromium.org, falken, picksi1  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/heads/master  **Project:** [blink](/search?project=blink)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=82804f94bf4b4d551c864ff2ef44317633f76246 "Find reviews for the same repository ID - 82804f94bf4b4d551c864ff2ef44317633f76246") | DescriptionThis patch refactors TimerBase to post tasks, and deletes the obsolete Blink TimerHeap. Unfortunately this meant refactoring WorkerThreads too (ideally that would have been done in a separate patch). I have change them to use the new WorkerScheduler's idle tasks for v8 GC. ATTN Sheriffs: If there are weird layout test flakes all of a sudden, this patch may be the cause since the interleaving of blink timers with other chromium tasks will change.

I guess it might be possible to get the WorkerSharedTimer to somehow post tasks onto the new WorkerScheduler.  Looking at the chromium implementation of SharedTimer there seems to be one timer shared across all threads (that seems somewhat odd), unless it turns out there's one BlinkPlatformImpl per thread.  If it turns out that there is a lot of (temporary) plumbing on the chromium side to support splitting this up I'd argue against doing so.

I'm not really convinced those terms are helpful in blink.  They have well defined meanings in chromium, but this business of not starting idle tasks is pretty much a hack.  I'd like to see it go away since IMO only the scheduler should know anything about idle periods.

I think that might depend on who does the owners review.  I'm not sure what you mean here. LayoutTest changes don't need OWNER's reviews so you could land these changes independently of this change if it's possible (I think this would make it clearer that the change shouldn't change behaviour well written layouttests if it didn't modify any itself, but I don't really mind either way).

My interpretation of that rule is Blink style prefers early returns for 'early outs' (e.g., if (x==NULL) return), however this was an early return for the expected case. I may be wrong in that interpretation though.  In any case I think this is much clearer since it makes clear what the return value of idleNotification represents, which I don't think is clear otherwise.

CanExceedIdleDeadlineIfRequired should only return true if there is no pending task scheduled within the next 50ms idle period (that's what's implementented by the SchedulerHelper anyway). ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-20 21:08:28 UTC) [#37](#msg37) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | Dry run: Try jobs failed on following builders: mac\_blink\_rel on tryserver.blink (JOB\_FAILED, http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.blink/builders/mac\_blink\_rel/builds/52592) | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-20 21:08:30 UTC) [#38](#msg38) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Dry run: Try jobs failed on following builders:   mac_blink_rel on tryserver.blink (JOB_FAILED, <http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.blink/builders/mac_blink_rel/builds/52592>) ```     | **alex clarke (OOO till 29th)** | | Patchset #7 (id:140001) has been deleted | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-23 12:49:18 UTC) [#39](#msg39) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Patchset #7 (id:140001) has been deleted ```     | **alex clarke (OOO till 29th)** | | Patchset #8 (id:180001) has been deleted | | --- | | 5 years, 8 months ago (2015-04-23 12:49:37 UTC) [#40](#msg40) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Patchset #8 (id:180001) has been deleted ```     | **Sami** | | FYI, I moved this to https://codereview.chromium.org/1134523002. | | --- | | 5 years, 7 months ago (2015-05-07 15:57:27 UTC) [#41](#msg41) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` FYI, I moved this to <https://codereview.chromium.org/1134523002>. ```     Expand Messages | Collapse Messages | Show Generated Messages | Hide Generated Messages |

## Issue [1153763005](/1153763005/): scheduler: Allow timer task to be nested (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 7 months ago by [Sami](/user/Sami)  **Modified:** 5 years, 7 months ago  **Reviewers:** [rmcilroy](/user/rmcilroy), [alex clarke (OOO till 29th)](/user/alex%20clarke%20%28OOO%20till%2029th%29)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, scheduler-bugs\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | Descriptionscheduler: Allow timer task to be nested Blink's current shared timer mechanism, which we are trying to replace, allows timers to execute in nested message loops, but only if the nested message loop itself was not initiated by a timer. We believe this limitation is a historical relic which was originally introduced to prevent multiple invocations of the same timer[1]. When the shared timer is replaced by indivially posted tasks, the underlying scheduler will ensure that each task is only executed once. Therefore it should be safe to lift this restriction.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/09/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, September 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 45 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 45.0.2454.85 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/44.0.2403.157..45.0.2454.85?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 45.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [29 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M45). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[526825](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=526825)] CVE-2015-1301: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.5 branch (currently 4.5.103.29).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

[Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
