Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1775:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a proxy endpoint exposed by Ambari at `api/v1/proxy`. This endpoint allows authenticated users to make REST calls to arbitrary host:port combinations accessible from the Ambari server host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The proxy endpoint lacked proper restrictions, allowing authenticated users to make requests to internal services and potentially conduct port scans.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Proxy Endpoint**:  The proxy endpoint could be used to send requests to arbitrary host:port combinations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Port Scanning:** Malicious users could leverage the proxy endpoint to perform port scans of the network visible to the Ambari server.
*   **Access to Unsecured Services:** Attackers could access unsecured internal services that are only accessible from the Ambari server's network.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Potential to access sensitive internal resources and data through the vulnerable proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Direct network access to the Ambari Server is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user to use the proxy.
*   **Admin Privileges for Non-GET methods**: Ambari admin users can use other HTTP methods besides GET, increasing impact. Non-admin users can use the proxy with the GET method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Ambari system.
*   For exploiting with methods other than GET, the attacker must be an Ambari admin user.
*   The attacker must have network access to the Ambari server.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Ambari version 2.1.0 or above, where the vulnerable proxy endpoint (`api/v1/proxy`) has been disabled by default.
*   A configurable parameter (`proxy.allowed.hostports`) was introduced in the `ambari.properties` file to explicitly specify a list of allowed host/port combinations when the proxy utility is used.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Olejarka (SecuRing).
