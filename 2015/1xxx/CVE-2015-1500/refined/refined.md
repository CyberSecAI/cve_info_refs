The provided content is related to CVE-2015-1500. It describes two distinct buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor, both sharing the same CVE ID.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `graphManager.load` method of the `TSUnicodeGraphEditorControl`. The application fails to validate the size of user-supplied input before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vectors:** The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to induce the target to interact with malicious content (visiting a page or opening a file).

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `factory.loadExtensionFactory` method of the `TSUnicodeGraphEditorControl`. The application fails to validate the size of user-supplied input before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*  **Attack vectors:** The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to induce the target to interact with malicious content (visiting a page or opening a file).

The advisory notes that SolarWinds has released an update to address these vulnerabilities and Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection via filter IDs `16732` and `16728` respectively.
