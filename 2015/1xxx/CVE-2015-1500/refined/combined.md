# Advisory Details

February 10th, 2015
## SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor TSUnicodeGraphEditorControl graphManager.load Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-044ZDI-CAN-2380

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-1500](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1500) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | SolarWinds |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Server and Application Monitor |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['16732']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the 'graphManager' object's load method. The issue lies in a failure to validate the size of an attacker-supplied input before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | SolarWinds has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2014-09-03 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2015-02-10 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
