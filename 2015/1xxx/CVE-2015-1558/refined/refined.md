Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to reclaim allocated RTP ports when an endpoint offers only codecs that are not allowed by the Asterisk server. When Asterisk rejects the incompatible codec offer, it does not free the allocated RTP ports, leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File descriptor leak**: Specifically, the allocated RTP ports are not deallocated, resulting in a file descriptor leak.
- **Resource exhaustion**: The accumulation of leaked file descriptors can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: By repeatedly sending SDP offers with incompatible codecs, an attacker can exhaust the server's available file descriptors, causing it to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote**: The attack can be initiated remotely by any authenticated endpoint that can send SDP offers to the Asterisk server.
- **Network**: The vulnerability is exploited via network communication using the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated endpoint on the Asterisk server.
- **SDP Offer Capability**: The attacker needs the ability to send SDP offers containing codecs that are not allowed by the Asterisk server configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects the PJSIP channel driver in Asterisk, not the chan_sip driver.
- Asterisk versions 12.x and 13.x are affected, while versions 1.8.x and 11.x are not.
- The issue has been patched in Asterisk Open Source versions 12.8.1 and 13.1.1
