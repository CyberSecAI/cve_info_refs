Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2015-001

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | File descriptor leak when incompatible codecs are offered |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Resource exhaustion |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Authenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Major |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | 6 January, 2015 |
| **Reported By** | Y Ateya |
| **Posted On** | 9 January, 2015 |
| **Last Updated On** | February 11, 2015 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Mark Michelson <mmichelson AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2015-1558 |

| **Description** | Asterisk may be configured to only allow specific audio or video codecs to be used when communicating with a particular endpoint. When an endpoint sends an SDP offer that only lists codecs not allowed by Asterisk, the offer is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that are allocated in the process are not reclaimed.    This issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in Asterisk. Users of the chan\_sip channel driver are not affected.    As the resources are allocated after authentication, this issue only affects communications with authenticated endpoints. |

| **Resolution** | The reported leak has been patched. |

         CVE Name       Pending

    Description  Asterisk may be configured to only allow specific audio or
                 video codecs to be used when communicating with a
                 particular endpoint. When an endpoint sends an SDP offer
                 that only lists codecs not allowed by Asterisk, the offer
                 is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that are
                 allocated in the process are not reclaimed.

                 This issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in
                 Asterisk. Users of the chan_sip channel driver are not
                 affected.

                 As the resources are allocated after authentication, this
                 issue only affects communications with authenticated
                 endpoints.

    Resolution  The reported leak has been patched.
