Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `order_by` parameter within the WordPress Photo Gallery plugin. Specifically, the plugin directly uses the value of the `order_by` parameter in a SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is an unauthenticated SQL injection, meaning an attacker can exploit it without needing to log into the WordPress site.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** It is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker does not receive the output of the SQL query directly. Instead, they need to infer the result using boolean-based (true/false) or time-based techniques.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `order_by` parameter in the GET request to `admin-ajax.php` is the specific point of entry for the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Database Manipulation:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Full Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could gain complete control over the WordPress site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not directly mentioned, if an attacker can obtain the password hashes for admin accounts, this could lead to privilege escalation, and therefore full compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   **`order_by` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection is inserted into the `order_by` parameter.
*   **Blind SQLi Techniques:** The attacker has to use boolean-based or time-based techniques to exploit the blind SQLi.
*   **`BETWEEN` Keyword:** The characters `<` and `>` are filtered to `&lt;` and `&gt;`, respectively, requiring the attacker to use the `BETWEEN` keyword for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have a working knowledge of SQL injection techniques, particularly blind SQL injection.
*   **Gallery Data:** The attacker needs to know that at least one gallery with at least one image exists on the target WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Brute-Force Gallery ID:** If the attacker does not know the gallery ID, they need to be able to attempt to brute-force it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions a small example module for enumeration of tables and the length of values within the users table, but this is not provided directly, but is available as an attachment.
*   A more weaponized version that supports pulling actual values is available on ExploitHub.
*   The vulnerability exists in version 1.2.7 and likely prior versions of the Photo Gallery plugin.
