  "CVE-2015-1251": {
    "root_cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the SpeechRecognitionClient implementation within the Speech subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by manipulating the freed memory to control function pointers called via a dangling pointer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web page",
       "User interaction required to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create a malicious webpage and entice the victim to open it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when a `webkitSpeechRecognition` JavaScript object is created in a popup window and then the popup is closed. This frees a C++ object used internally, but leaves a dangling pointer. Later, calling the `start()` method reuses the dangling pointer to call a function from the freed memory. The attacker can potentially groom the heap after the free and before the reuse to execute arbitrary code. Exploitation requires bypassing ASLR and DEP mitigations. Disabling Javascript may prevent the exploit. The vulnerability was found through fuzzing."
