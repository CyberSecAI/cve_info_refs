Chrome blink Speech­Recognition­Controller use-after-free

![](/Images/Vuln.svg "Vuln")![](/Images/Google Chrome.svg "Google Chrome")

# Chrome blink Speech­Recognition­Controller use-after-free

([Chromium 455857](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455857), [CVE-2015-1251](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1251))

## Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause the blink rendering engine used by
Google Chrome and Chromium to continue to use a speech recognition API object
after the memory block that contained the object has been freed. An attacker
can force the code to read a pointer from the freed memory and use this to call
a function, allowing arbitrary code execution.

## Known affected software and attack vectors

* **Google Chrome 39.0**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  webpage. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the
  vulnerable code path.

[Repro.html](/20161123001/Repro.html)

<html>
<head>
<script>
o­Window = window.open();
o­Webkit­Speech­Recognition = new o­Window.webkit­Speech­Recognition();
o­Window.close();
set­Interval(function(){
if (o­Window.closed) {
o­Webkit­Speech­Recognition.start();
}
}, 10);
</script>
</head>
</html>

## Description

Creating a `webkit­Speech­Recognition` Javascript object in a popup window before
closing the popup frees a C++ object used internally by the speech recognition
API code but leaves a dangling pointer to the freed memory in another C++
object. When the `start()` Javascript method is called, this dangling pointer
is used to try to read a function pointer from a virtual function table and
call that function. An attacker has ample time to groom the heap between the
free and re-use in order to control the function pointer used by the code,
allowing arbitrary code execution.

This sequence of events describes the process happening in the repro:

1. When a new window is opened from Javascript, a C++
   `Speech­Recognition­Client­Proxy` object is instantiated.
2. When a new `webkit­Speech­Recognition` object is created in Javascript, a
   `Speech­Recognition` C++ object is created to back it up internally.
3. In the constructor of the `Speech­Recognition` C++ object, the `m_­controller`
   member variable is initialized by creating a new
   `Speech­Recognition­Controller` C++ object using
   `Speech­Recognition­Controller::from`.

   `speech/Speech­Recognition.cpp:`

   ```
   Speech­Recognition::Speech­Recognition(Execution­Context* context)
   /* <<<snip>>> */
       m_­controller = Speech­Recognition­Controller::from(page);
       ASSERT(m_­controller);
   /* <<<snip>>> */

   ```
4. In the constructor of the `Speech­Recognition­Controller` C++ object, the
   `m_­client` member variable is initialized by storing a pointer to the
   `Speech­Recognition­Client­Proxy` C++ object created in step 1.

   `speech/Speech­Recognition­Controller.cpp:`

   ```
   Speech­Recognition­Controller::Speech­Recognition­Controller(Pass­Own­Ptr<Speech­Recognition­Client> client)
       : m_­client(client)
   /* <<<snip>>> */

   ```
5. When the window created in step 1 is closed, the
   `Speech­Recognition­Client­Proxy` C++ object created in step 1 is destroyed
   and the memory previously used to store the object is freed.
6. When the `start` Javascript method of the `webkit­Speech­Recognition` object
   created in step 2 is called, the `start` C++ method of the
   `Speech­Recognition­Controller` object is called internally. This method in
   turn calls the `start` C++ method of the previously freed
   `Speech­Recognition­Client­Proxy` object through its `m_­client` member
   variable.

   `speech/Speech­Recognition.cpp:`

   ```
   void Speech­Recognition::start(Exception­State& exception­State)
   /* <<<snip>>> */
       m_­controller->start(/* <<<snip>>> */);
   /* <<<snip>>> */

   ```

   `speech/Speech­Recognition­Controller.h`:

   ```
   void start(/* <<<snip>>> */)
   {
       m_­client->start(/* <<<snip>>> */);
   }

   ```

   In the last code snippet, when this code is executed, the `m_­client` member
   no longer points to a valid object, as this object has been deleted and its
   memory freed.

## Exploit

An attacker looking to exploit this issue is going to want to try and control
the contents of the freed memory, before getting the code to use the dangling
pointer to call a virtual function. Doing so would allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code. This is made possible because steps 5 and 6 can both be
triggered at a time of the attackers choosing, giving the attacker the ability
to free the memory in step 5 whenever this is convenient and attempt to
reallocate and fill it with any data before executing step 6. This should allow
an attacker to create a fake `vftable` pointer and gain arbitrary code
execution. In order to develop a working exploit, existing mitigations will
need to be bypassed, most significantly ASLR and DEP. As this vulnerability by
itself does not appear to allow bypassing these mitigations, I did not develop
a working exploit for it.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/05/stable-channel-update_19.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, May 19, 2015

The Chrome team is happy to announce the promotion of Chrome 43 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 43.0.2357.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements.  A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/42.0.2311.0..43.0.2357.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M43&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[489518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489518)] CVE-2015-1265: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.3 branch (currently 4.3.61.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

# CVE-2015-1251: Chrome blink Speech­Recognition­Controller use-after-free details

---

*From*: Berend-Jan Wever <berendj () nwever nl>

*Date*: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 10:21:30 +0100

```
Throughout November, I plan to release details on vulnerabilities I
found in web-browsers which I've not released before. This is the
seventeenth entry in that series. Unfortunately I won't be able to
publish everything within one month at the current rate, so I may
continue to publish these through December and January.

The below information is available in more detail on my blog at
<http://blog.skylined.nl/20161123001.html>. There you can find a repro
that triggered this issue, snippets from the vulnerable source and more
details in addition to the information below.

Follow me on <http://twitter.com/berendjanwever> for daily browser bugs.

Chrome blink SpeechRecognitionController use-after-free
=======================================================
(Chromium 455857, CVE-2015-1251)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can cause the blink rendering engine used
by Google Chrome and Chromium to continue to use a speech recognition
API object after the memory block that contained the object has been
freed. An attacker can force the code to read a pointer from the freed
memory and use this to call a function, allowing arbitrary code execution.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
+ Google Chrome 39.0

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted webpage. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from
  triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description
-----------
Creating a `webkitSpeechRecognition` Javascript object in a popup window
before closing the popup frees a C++ object used internally by the
speech recognition API code but leaves a dangling pointer to the freed
memory in another C++ object. When the `start()` Javascript method is
called, this dangling pointer is used to try to read a function pointer
from a virtual function table and call that function. An attacker has
ample time to groom the heap between the free and re-use in order to
control the function pointer used by the code, allowing arbitrary code
execution.

Exploit
-------
An attacker looking to exploit this issue is going to want to try and
control the contents of the freed memory, before getting the code to use
the dangling pointer to call a virtual function. Doing so would allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is made possible because steps
5 and 6 can both be triggered at a time of the attackers choosing,
giving the attacker the ability to free the memory in step 5 whenever
this is convenient and attempt to reallocate and fill it with any data
before executing step 6. This should allow an attacker to create a fake
`vftable` pointer and gain arbitrary code execution. In order to develop
a working exploit, existing mitigations will need to be bypassed, most
significantly ASLR and DEP. As this vulnerability by itself does not
appear to allow bypassing these mitigations, I did not develop a working
exploit for it.

Time-line
---------
* November 2014: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* December 2014: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI and iDefense.
* January 2015: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.
* February 2015: This vulnerability was fixed in revision 190993.
* May 2015: This vulnerability was addressed by Google in
  Chrome 43.0.2357.65.
* November 2016: Details of this issue are released.

Cheers,

SkyLined

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
