The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-1091.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A cross-domain HTTP request headers issue existed in redirect handling within CFNetwork Session. Specifically, HTTP request headers sent in a redirect response could be passed on to another origin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-domain request header leakage
- Improper redirect handling

**Impact of exploitation:**
Authentication credentials might be sent to a server on another origin. This could expose sensitive information and potentially allow unauthorized access to user accounts or services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack involves redirecting a user's request to a malicious server.
- This can happen when a user interacts with a compromised or attacker-controlled website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the redirect target.
- The attacker needs to be able to receive the leaked headers.
