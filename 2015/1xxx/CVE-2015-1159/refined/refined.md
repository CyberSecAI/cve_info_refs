1.  Analysis of CVE-2015-1159

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CUPS template engine (cgi_puts function in cgi-bin/template.c). The template engine echoes user input without proper sanitization, leading to the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-79)
    *   Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the QUERY parameter in the help page of the web interface, potentially leading to malicious script execution in a user's browser, which may allow an attacker to bypass CUPS' default "localhost" configuration, gaining unauthorized access to the CUPS server
    *  This may lead to privilege escalation and further attacks on the CUPS server, via replacement of the configuration file.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability through a web browser by sending a crafted URL to the CUPS help page using the QUERY parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the CUPS server and the ability to make HTTP requests to its web interface.
    *  The web interface of CUPS needs to be enabled

2.  Additional Details from the Content:
    *   The vulnerability is present in CUPS versions prior to 2.0.3.
    *   The web interface is typically enabled on many Linux distributions, making them vulnerable by default.
    *   Some distributions, such as OS X, may have the web interface deactivated by default.
    *   The vulnerability is also linked to CVE-2015-1158 as it allows for bypassing default configuration, leading to a full CUPS configuration file replacement (if CVE-2015-1158 is present)
    *   Red Hat notes that this flaw was also discovered in CUPS where a cross-site scripting flaw was found in the cups web templating engine which allowed an attacker to bypass the default configuration settings that bind the CUPS scheduler to the localhost or loopback interface.
    *  Exploitation does not require special permissions, aside from being able to send a print job request, as described in the CERT vulnerability report (though, this is related to CVE-2015-1158).
