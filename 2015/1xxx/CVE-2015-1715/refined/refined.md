Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Silverlight improperly allowing applications intended to run at a low integrity level to be executed at a medium integrity level or higher.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper enforcement of integrity levels for Silverlight applications.
- Failure to restrict non-elevated processes to low integrity levels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same or higher level of permissions as the currently logged-on user.
- Potential for attackers to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to log on to the system, or convince a logged-on user to execute a specially crafted Silverlight application.
- The vulnerability is triggered when Silverlight incorrectly elevates the privileges of an application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to run a crafted Silverlight application on the targeted system.
- The attacker must either have legitimate access to log on to the system or be able to trick a user into executing the malicious application.
