## Update FAQ

**Why are the same update files in this bulletin also denoted in the GDI+ bulletin?**

Although this bulletin and the GDI+ bulletin releasing simultaneously each address different security vulnerabilities, the security updates for each have been consolidated, hence the occurrence of identical update files being present across the two bulletins.

Note that identical update packages denoted in multiple bulletins do not need to be installed more than once.

**Which web browsers support Microsoft Silverlight applications?**

In order to run Microsoft Silverlight applications, most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, require Microsoft Silverlight to be installed and the corresponding plug-in to be enabled. For more information about Microsoft Silverlight, see the official site, [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). Please refer to the documentation of your browser to learn more about how to disable or remove plug-ins.

**What versions of Microsoft Silverlight 5 are affected by the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Silverlight build 5.1.40416.00, which was the current build of Microsoft Silverlight as of when this bulletin was first released, addresses the vulnerability and is not affected. Builds of Microsoft Silverlight previous to 5.1.40416.00 are affected.

**How do I know which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on my system?**

If Microsoft Silverlight is already installed on your computer, you can visit the [Get Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight) page, which will indicate which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Manage Add-Ons feature of current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the version and build information that is currently installed on your system.

You can also manually check the version number of sllauncher.exe located in the "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x86 Microsoft Windows systems) or in the "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x64 Microsoft Windows systems).

In addition, on Microsoft Windows, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found in the registry at [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x86 Microsoft Windows systems, or [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x64 Microsoft Windows systems.

On Apple Mac OS, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found as follows:

1. Open the **Finder**
2. Select the system drive and go to the folder **Internet Plug-ins - Library**
3. Right-click the file **Silverlight.Plugin** (if your mouse has only one button, press the **Ctrl** key while clicking on the file) to bring up the context menu, then click **Show Package Contents**
4. Inside the contents folder, locate the file **info.plist** and open it with an editor. It will contain an entry like this, which shows you the version number:

   SilverlightVersion

   5.1.40416.00

The version installed with this security update for Microsoft Silverlight 5 is 5.1.40416.00. If your Microsoft Silverlight 5 version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable.

**How do I upgrade my version of Microsoft Silverlight?**

The Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature helps make sure that your Microsoft Silverlight installation is kept up to date with the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, Microsoft Silverlight functionality, and security features. For more information about the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Updater](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/resources/documentation/updater.aspx). Windows users who have disabled the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature can enroll in [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) to obtain the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, or can download the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight manually using the download link in the Affected Software table in the earlier section, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**. For information about deploying Microsoft Silverlight in an enterprise environment, see the [Silverlight Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119611).

**Will this update upgrade my version of Silverlight?**

The 3056819 update upgrades previous versions of Silverlight to Silverlight version 5.1.40416.00. Microsoft recommends upgrading to be protected against the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

**Where can I find additional information about the Silverlight product lifecycle?**

For lifecycle information specific to Silverlight, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Support Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifean45).

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Silverlight Out of Browser Application Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1715

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Silverlight that is caused when Silverlight improperly allows applications that are intended to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions) to be executed at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user) or higher. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would first have to log on to the system or convince a logged on user to execute a specially crafted Silverlight application.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with the same or higher level of permissions as the currently logged on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. The update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional checks to ensure that non-elevated processes are restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions).

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
