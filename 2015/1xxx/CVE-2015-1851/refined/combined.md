Package        : cinder
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1851
Debian Bug     : 788996

Bastian Blank from credativ discovered that cinder, a
storage-as-a-service system for the OpenStack cloud computing suite,
contained a bug that would allow an authenticated user to read any
file from the cinder server.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2014.1.3-11+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2015.1.0+2015.06.16.git26.9634b76ba5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cinder packages.

### Bug Description

Cinder does not provide input format to several calls of "qemu-img convert". This allows the attacker to play the format guessing by providing a volume with a qcow2 signature. If this signature contains a base file, this file will be read by a process running as root and embedded in the output. This bug is similar to CVE-2013-1922.

Tested with: lvm backed volume storage, it may apply to others as well

Steps to reproduce:

- create volume and attach to vm,

- create a qcow2 signature with base-file[1] from within the vm and

- trigger upload to glance with "cinder upload-to-image --disk-type qcow2"[2].

The image uploaded to glance will have /etc/passwd from the cinder-volume host embedded.

Affected versions: tested on 2014.1.3, found while reading 2014.2.1

Fix: Always specify both input "-f" and output format "-O" to "qemu-img convert". The code is in module cinder.image.image\_utils.

Bastian Blank

[1]: qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb

[2]: The disk-type != raw triggers the use of "qemu-img convert"

Sorry for the late response on this (midcycle meetup last week and catching up with emails). I was definitely able to verify this with the reproduce steps. Thanks for reporting this Bastian.

While you are at it, there may be more surprises.

- cinder/nova calls "qemu-img info" without format. While this only

  leads to missidentification, I don't know if this could be used

  further.

- nova/cinder calls "qemu-img resize" without format. Unlikely to be

  exploitable.

- nova calls "qemu-img convert" without input format. This should be

  exploitable if instance storage uses raw images (raw, rbd, lvm).

Tony has agreed to look into this from the Nova side after he finishes up some other work he's doing.

Looking through the Nova code it seems that all of our uses of qemu-img create pass -f and an input format. Is this exploitable with just -O being left off?

Ahh, good catch. I glossed over that one somehow. And that is used in the code path for creating a snapshot to upload.

FYI If cinder (or any part of Nova/Glance/etc) ever creates qcow2 files with backing files, it must also make sure to use the '-obacking\_fmt=FORMATNAME' option when creating them, to stop QEMU probiing formats when opening backing files.

@waldi: I couldn't find your affiliation, any company you want to be mentioned with this advisory ?

@nova-coresec: Can you check if other vulnerable image conversions exist (beside the snapshot upload) ?

Assuming this affects all cinder backend, here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Host file disclosure through qcow2 backing file

Reporter: Bastian Blank

Products: Cinder and Nova

Affects: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2

Description:

Bastian Blank reported a vulnerability in Cinder and Nova. By creating a qcow2 image with an arbitrary backing file, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to. All Cinder setups and all Nova setups with force\_raw\_image (which is set by default) are affected.

By creating a qcow2 image with an arbitrary backing file, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to. All Cinder setups and all Nova setups with force\_raw\_image (which is set by default) are affected.

@ttx nova is certainly vulnerable in the snapshot case. From what I see nova may \*also\* be vulnerable (at least in theory) when creating instances.

As Tony said, Nova is vulnerable in the snapshot case. I'm not an expert in the libvirt driver and the complexity of the image handling code makes it hard to say with certainty that the vulnerability exists during instance creation, but it does appear to me that it uses the unprotected 'qemu-img create' with an LVM image type. I can't say at this point whether or not there are safeguards in place that means that is ok.

I find that description not well formulated. For me "creating an image"

implies that I have a new file after that. But in this case there

already exists the volume or instance disk and I have to use them for

the attack.

Also what is "force\_raw\_image"?

I tried that and was unable to get past the initial check. However this

code does a blacklist test instead of a whitelist tests of features the

image may have.

Okay, it parses the output of "qemu-img info", which looks more like it

is created for human, not machine consumption.

Hum, upon a secondary review it seems that force\_raw\_image only prevents the convertion from fetch\_image, but not from the image backend. Nevermind that note, I guess every nova setups are affected.

Ah, I missed that this is a Nova-only setting. Every call to

"convert\_image" with something that may be a raw-image is affected.

Thought I'd get the patch conversation started with this.

This change explicitly requires all calls to convert\_image to supply an image format. It touches a lot of drivers so may not be desirable. The alternative will need to use qemu-img info for each call to derive the image type.

\*Note this only covers the qemu-img convert cases in cinder. I will take a look at required changes in Nova next.

Well, you mix in correct but independent cleanup changes (renaming of

And this would fix the problem how? The format guessing qemu-img does

Thanks for the review Bastain. I'll try to cleanup some of my clean ups.. but I'm not convinced I have the driver code changes right anyway.

Can we get @cinder-coresec and @nova-coresec to come up something decent for this please? I'd like to get this moving along !

Since there hasn't been much other movement on this I've updated a new patch that hopefully addresses the variable renaming complaints. As we can't rely on calls to qemu-img info to determine the source format explicit decisions need to be made in the driver code in cases that call image\_utils.convert\_image(). I couldn't really find a case where I could reliably discover this information from the database.. so I've added a configuration setting for the affected drivers. I can't be certain if the default values I've supplied here are correct or even sensible. So I would again ask cinder devs to please take a look at this and suggest a viable alternative.

Thanks.

I don't think this patch will work reliably. Coding the expected format in the configuration for images coming from Glance doesn't work because because the images could be a number of different formats -- we need to query Glance for that information.

I've taken a look at a different instance of this same issue in this spec [1], which revolves around similar problems guessing formats of volume/snapshot files. It's a different scenario, but the gist of it is, at any point that you are handling an image or file from the "outside", you have to have a separate identifier indicating what format it is in, which isn't the file itself.

For this bug, Glance should be able to tell us that. But coding expected formats in the configuration isn't viable since it restricts us to only one format, and opens up holes such as someone supplying a raw image with a malicious qcow2 header written into it, which is accepted because the configuration by default says that it is qcow2.

Not sure which trick you mean. But the only way to properly fix this is

to actually supply the input format, as only the storage layer knows.

If you resort to guessing, this will get you a nice way to hide

information, including unusable backups.

This patch handles this scenario by stopping the upload process if the volume data contains a header referencing a backing file.

This is an intermediate solution until we can implement full format tracking of volume data, but it prevents this bug from causing a data leak by failing safe.

Bastian: The problem is, in a few cases, we don't know the storage format for sure. For filesystem based starge, nova can and does change the format during certain operations, without telling cinder. This is something we're working on fixing, and I agree it is a better fix, but it isn't going to be quick or simple.

This are "few cases". So you can fix the known cases, properly document

the cases where you may not know. But I want to have some informations:

- the code location of this stabbing cinder in the back and

- the db location nova itself stores this information (or does it always

  fall back to sniffing, which means all qemu calls needs to be audited

  as well).

So fix the locations that are easy and properly set the type to

undefined if you don't know. I don't really think lvm/iscsi backed

volumes will be changed in this way.

It's been over two months now without any real progress. Now you claim

it can't be fixed, only worked around. So I don't consider waiting any

longer will help and think about publishing this issue after easter.

So, if there have been CVE assigned please document them, otherwise I

will take care of that.

Regards,

Bastian

Bastian: the security fix will likely be a workaround -- that doesn't prevent the issue from being fully fixed in a future version (by tracking format appropriately). Agree that this is taking way too long.

@Cinder-coresec: please review proposed patch

@Nova-coresec: please propose patch to cover for the case @ comment #10

We'll get a CVE based on the impact description at comment #20 for you to include in your public disclosure.

Apologies on the time it took to verify Eric's patch. I have verified this workaround works. It stops all uploads that have a backing file as mentioned in the commit message.

My understanding from the history is that Cinder's patch is ready and reviewed but the Nova issue is still a problem, is this correct?

Now this issue is disclosed and public, I think we need to raise the urgency of some code mitigation/workaround?

Eric, as the issue is now public - worth pushing your patch to gerrit?

On the nova side, the recent slowness (to my understanding) is that we've had a lot of trouble actually finding an exploit for this. We agree there is a theoretical problem, but we haven't been able to actually replicate a working attack.

So... Nova needs to do some defensive work here, but that effort is not yet complete.

I tried to recreate this myself.. TL;DR I didn't succeed.

I created a cinder (LVM backend) volume, attached it as vdb to a guest and within the guest ran "qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb"

Introspecting on the underlying host, it looks like things are progressing:

# qemu-img info /dev/mapper/stack--volumes--lvmdriver--1-volume--6c76f71d--6ccb--4a95--845c--40fd9af1a12d | grep backing

backing file: /etc/passwd

I then created a second guest, and made the root boot from volume the cinder volume from above. Then following running "nova image-create" a reference does appear in Glance with the correct name set, but a null file size.

Attempting to retrieve the image through glance a 0 byte file is returned.

Mikal is correct nova has a theoretical issue but I've been unable to actually exploit it..

I've certainly been able to create a guest with an image that shows the problem BUT as yet I haven't been able to get nova to run convert on it.

A related issue is that nova blindly trusts qemu-img info which is itself susceptible to a similar issue.

commit 9634b76ba5886d6c2f2128d550cb005dabf48213

Author: Eric Harney <email address hidden>

Disallow backing files when uploading volumes to image

Volumes with a header referencing a backing file can leak

    file data into the destination image when uploading a

    volume to an image.

Halt the upload process if the volume data references a

    backing file to prevent this.

Closes-Bug: #1415087

A CVE was requested for a suspected vulnerability in Nova, but was never confirmed exploitable. Unless someone comes forward soon with a reproducible case there, I recommend we request a reject of CVE 2015-1850 for completeness.

Thanks, Matt. Even if we couldn't find a way to exploit this, that doesn't mean there isn't one or that a fix isn't needed. Nova should not be doing what is described in comment 74.

I agree this is at least a security hardening opportunity in Nova, and would be great to patch if someone is interested in writing that patch. However the decision to issue a security hinges on having a clearer explanation of \_how\_ this makes users of Nova vulnerable, and would still need the aforementioned patch (and would need to be the sort we could safely provide to users of supported stable release branches without introducing new configuration or backward-incompatible behavior changes).

I'm going to mark the nova part of this as incomplete since no one has said they know how to demonstrate a vulnerability in nova for this. The CVE for nova is marked as reserved:

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2015-1850>

And the OSSA was released for the cinder CVE:

<https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2015-011.html>

Furthermore, distros like Red Hat have already been posting that this is something to be aware of but does not have a fix and is considered low severity:

<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1850>

Same with Canonical:

OSSA-2015-011 let the cat out of the bag on CVE-2015-1850, and then so have RedHat and Canonical with their statements as well, so while it's technically still reserved in the mitre system, that's really an inaccuracy at this point. The information is out there.

To reiterate Matt's comment #80, "no one has said they know how to demonstrate a vulnerability in nova for this." If someone steps up to fix the underlying bug, I doubt there will be any objection, but the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team won't issue any official advisory statement without documented impact.

OSSA 2015-011 assigned the wrong CVE and it should have included
CVE-2015-1851 instead. An ERRATA will be issued soon.

This is correct. Note that while a CVE has been assigned for the Nova
part, the bug has still not been reproduced there, and while there is no
patch, Nova has been left out of this OSSA.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

### Bug Description

Cinder does not provide input format to several calls of "qemu-img convert". This allows the attacker to play the format guessing by providing a volume with a qcow2 signature. If this signature contains a base file, this file will be read by a process running as root and embedded in the output. This bug is similar to CVE-2013-1922.

Tested with: lvm backed volume storage, it may apply to others as well

Steps to reproduce:

- create volume and attach to vm,

- create a qcow2 signature with base-file[1] from within the vm and

- trigger upload to glance with "cinder upload-to-image --disk-type qcow2"[2].

The image uploaded to glance will have /etc/passwd from the cinder-volume host embedded.

Affected versions: tested on 2014.1.3, found while reading 2014.2.1

Fix: Always specify both input "-f" and output format "-O" to "qemu-img convert". The code is in module cinder.image.image\_utils.

Bastian Blank

[1]: qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb

[2]: The disk-type != raw triggers the use of "qemu-img convert"

While you are at it, there may be more surprises.

- cinder/nova calls "qemu-img info" without format. While this only

  leads to missidentification, I don't know if this could be used

  further.

- nova/cinder calls "qemu-img resize" without format. Unlikely to be

  exploitable.

- nova calls "qemu-img convert" without input format. This should be

  exploitable if instance storage uses raw images (raw, rbd, lvm).

Tony has agreed to look into this from the Nova side after he finishes up some other work he's doing.

Looking through the Nova code it seems that all of our uses of qemu-img create pass -f and an input format. Is this exploitable with just -O being left off?

@waldi: I couldn't find your affiliation, any company you want to be mentioned with this advisory ?

@nova-coresec: Can you check if other vulnerable image conversions exist (beside the snapshot upload) ?

Assuming this affects all cinder backend, here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Host file disclosure through qcow2 backing file

Reporter: Bastian Blank

Products: Cinder and Nova

Affects: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2

Description:

Bastian Blank reported a vulnerability in Cinder and Nova. By creating a qcow2 image with an arbitrary backing file, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to. All Cinder setups and all Nova setups with force\_raw\_image (which is set by default) are affected.

@ttx nova is certainly vulnerable in the snapshot case. From what I see nova may \*also\* be vulnerable (at least in theory) when creating instances.

As Tony said, Nova is vulnerable in the snapshot case. I'm not an expert in the libvirt driver and the complexity of the image handling code makes it hard to say with certainty that the vulnerability exists during instance creation, but it does appear to me that it uses the unprotected 'qemu-img create' with an LVM image type. I can't say at this point whether or not there are safeguards in place that means that is ok.

I find that description not well formulated. For me "creating an image"

implies that I have a new file after that. But in this case there

already exists the volume or instance disk and I have to use them for

the attack.

Also what is "force\_raw\_image"?

I tried that and was unable to get past the initial check. However this

code does a blacklist test instead of a whitelist tests of features the

image may have.

Okay, it parses the output of "qemu-img info", which looks more like it

is created for human, not machine consumption.

Hum, upon a secondary review it seems that force\_raw\_image only prevents the convertion from fetch\_image, but not from the image backend. Nevermind that note, I guess every nova setups are affected.

Thought I'd get the patch conversation started with this.

This change explicitly requires all calls to convert\_image to supply an image format. It touches a lot of drivers so may not be desirable. The alternative will need to use qemu-img info for each call to derive the image type.

\*Note this only covers the qemu-img convert cases in cinder. I will take a look at required changes in Nova next.

And this would fix the problem how? The format guessing qemu-img does

is the reason for problem.

Well, you mix in correct but independent cleanup changes (renaming of
variables).

Thanks for the review Bastain. I'll try to cleanup some of my clean ups.. but I'm not convinced I have the driver code changes right anyway.

Can we get @cinder-coresec and @nova-coresec to come up something decent for this please? I'd like to get this moving along !

Since there hasn't been much other movement on this I've updated a new patch that hopefully addresses the variable renaming complaints. As we can't rely on calls to qemu-img info to determine the source format explicit decisions need to be made in the driver code in cases that call image\_utils.convert\_image(). I couldn't really find a case where I could reliably discover this information from the database.. so I've added a configuration setting for the affected drivers. I can't be certain if the default values I've supplied here are correct or even sensible. So I would again ask cinder devs to please take a look at this and suggest a viable alternative.

Thanks.

I don't think this patch will work reliably. Coding the expected format in the configuration for images coming from Glance doesn't work because because the images could be a number of different formats -- we need to query Glance for that information.

I've taken a look at a different instance of this same issue in this spec [1], which revolves around similar problems guessing formats of volume/snapshot files. It's a different scenario, but the gist of it is, at any point that you are handling an image or file from the "outside", you have to have a separate identifier indicating what format it is in, which isn't the file itself.

For this bug, Glance should be able to tell us that. But coding expected formats in the configuration isn't viable since it restricts us to only one format, and opens up holes such as someone supplying a raw image with a malicious qcow2 header written into it, which is accepted because the configuration by default says that it is qcow2.

Not sure which trick you mean. But the only way to properly fix this is

to actually supply the input format, as only the storage layer knows.

If you resort to guessing, this will get you a nice way to hide

information, including unusable backups.

This patch handles this scenario by stopping the upload process if the volume data contains a header referencing a backing file.

This is an intermediate solution until we can implement full format tracking of volume data, but it prevents this bug from causing a data leak by failing safe.

Bastian: The problem is, in a few cases, we don't know the storage format for sure. For filesystem based starge, nova can and does change the format during certain operations, without telling cinder. This is something we're working on fixing, and I agree it is a better fix, but it isn't going to be quick or simple.

This are "few cases". So you can fix the known cases, properly document

the cases where you may not know. But I want to have some informations:

- the code location of this stabbing cinder in the back and

- the db location nova itself stores this information (or does it always

  fall back to sniffing, which means all qemu calls needs to be audited

  as well).

So fix the locations that are easy and properly set the type to

undefined if you don't know. I don't really think lvm/iscsi backed

volumes will be changed in this way.

It's been over two months now without any real progress. Now you claim

it can't be fixed, only worked around. So I don't consider waiting any

longer will help and think about publishing this issue after easter.

So, if there have been CVE assigned please document them, otherwise I

will take care of that.

Bastian

Bastian: the security fix will likely be a workaround -- that doesn't prevent the issue from being fully fixed in a future version (by tracking format appropriately). Agree that this is taking way too long.

My understanding from the history is that Cinder's patch is ready and reviewed but the Nova issue is still a problem, is this correct?

Now this issue is disclosed and public, I think we need to raise the urgency of some code mitigation/workaround?

Eric, as the issue is now public - worth pushing your patch to gerrit?

On the nova side, the recent slowness (to my understanding) is that we've had a lot of trouble actually finding an exploit for this. We agree there is a theoretical problem, but we haven't been able to actually replicate a working attack.

So... Nova needs to do some defensive work here, but that effort is not yet complete.

I tried to recreate this myself.. TL;DR I didn't succeed.

I created a cinder (LVM backend) volume, attached it as vdb to a guest and within the guest ran "qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb"

Introspecting on the underlying host, it looks like things are progressing:

# qemu-img info /dev/mapper/stack--volumes--lvmdriver--1-volume--6c76f71d--6ccb--4a95--845c--40fd9af1a12d | grep backing

backing file: /etc/passwd

I then created a second guest, and made the root boot from volume the cinder volume from above. Then following running "nova image-create" a reference does appear in Glance with the correct name set, but a null file size.

Attempting to retrieve the image through glance a 0 byte file is returned.

Mikal is correct nova has a theoretical issue but I've been unable to actually exploit it..

I've certainly been able to create a guest with an image that shows the problem BUT as yet I haven't been able to get nova to run convert on it.

A related issue is that nova blindly trusts qemu-img info which is itself susceptible to a similar issue.

@cinder-coresec, I submited the proposed patch for review in master and kilo, but the cherry-pick failed for Juno and Icehouse, can you please fix this ?

@nova-coresec, are we confident this does not affect any stable release starting from Icehouse ?

Until Nova is confirmed, here is the impact description of Cinder:

Title: Cinder host file disclosure through qcow2 backing file

Reporter: Bastian Blank (credativ)

Products: Cinder

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and version 2015.1.0

Description:

Bastian Blank from credativ reported a vulnerability in Cinder. By overwriting an image with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. All Cinder and Nova setups are affected.

Disallow backing files when uploading volumes to image

Volumes with a header referencing a backing file can leak

    file data into the destination image when uploading a

A CVE was requested for a suspected vulnerability in Nova, but was never confirmed exploitable. Unless someone comes forward soon with a reproducible case there, I recommend we request a reject of CVE 2015-1850 for completeness.

Anna, since nobody have been able to reproduce this bug in Nova, it seems like there will be no fix for it.

Someone from Nova team needs to mark this bug as Invalid.

Given nova.virt.libvirt.utils.create\_cow\_image which is calling qemu-img create with a backing file but not specifying the backing file format, I'd consider nova affected by this issue:

Thanks, Matt. Even if we couldn't find a way to exploit this, that doesn't mean there isn't one or that a fix isn't needed. Nova should not be doing what is described in comment 74.

I agree this is at least a security hardening opportunity in Nova, and would be great to patch if someone is interested in writing that patch. However the decision to issue a security hinges on having a clearer explanation of \_how\_ this makes users of Nova vulnerable, and would still need the aforementioned patch (and would need to be the sort we could safely provide to users of supported stable release branches without introducing new configuration or backward-incompatible behavior changes).

If we're just adding the hardening and tests then we should be able to do that in a backport compatible way.

I'm going to mark the nova part of this as incomplete since no one has said they know how to demonstrate a vulnerability in nova for this. The CVE for nova is marked as reserved:

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2015-1850>

And the OSSA was released for the cinder CVE:

<https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2015-011.html>

Furthermore, distros like Red Hat have already been posting that this is something to be aware of but does not have a fix and is considered low severity:

<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1850>

Same with Canonical:

OSSA-2015-011 let the cat out of the bag on CVE-2015-1850, and then so have RedHat and Canonical with their statements as well, so while it's technically still reserved in the mitre system, that's really an inaccuracy at this point. The information is out there.

To reiterate Matt's comment #80, "no one has said they know how to demonstrate a vulnerability in nova for this." If someone steps up to fix the underlying bug, I doubt there will be any objection, but the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team won't issue any official advisory statement without documented impact.

Tony, we talked at the summit. I believe you said you were working on nova changes to address this, and would throw up a WIP patch set folks could track. I haven't seen that patch set linked here. Can you give a status update?

By overwriting an image with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to.

By overwriting an image with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to.

presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend
physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and
NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports
volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.
Programatic management is available via Block Storage’s API.

A flaw was found in the cinder upload-to-image functionality. When
processing a malicious qcow2 header cinder could be tricked into reading
an arbitrary file from the cinder host. (CVE-2015-1851)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the cinder running services will be restarted automatically.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

By overwriting an image with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may mislead Cinder upload-to-image action, resulting in disclosure of any file from the Cinder server. A similar vulnerability in Nova can also be used by an authenticated user to trick Nova during a snapshot upload, resulting in disclosure of any file for which the Nova process user has access to. All Cinder and Nova setups are affected.

Subject: CVE-2015-1850: OpenStack Cinder/Nova: Format-guessing and file
 disclosure in image convert

Hi

OpenStack Cinder and Nova do not provide input format to several calls
of "qemu-img convert".  In Cinder these calls are done as root.  This
allows the attacker to play the format guessing in qemu-img by providing
input with a qcow2 signature.  If this signature contains a base file,
this file will be read by a process running as root and embedded in the
output.  This bug is similar to CVE-2013-1922 and has been assigned
CVE-2015-1850.

Tested with: lvm backed volume storage in Cinder, it may apply to others
as well.

Steps to reproduce:
- create volume and attach to vm,
- create a qcow2 signature on the volume containing a base-file[1] from
  within the vm and
- trigger an upload to Glance with "cinder upload-to-image --disk-type
  qcow2"[2].
The image uploaded to Glance will have the base-file from the
cinder-volume host embedded.

Affected versions: tested on 2014.1.3, found while reading 2014.2.1

Timeline:
- Reported upstream 2015-01-27
- Published 2015-06-13

Regards,
Bastian Blank

[1]: qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /etc/passwd /dev/vdb
[2]: The disk-type != raw triggers the use of "qemu-img convert"

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Could you clearify if this CVE assignment is correct? I noticed that
Red Hat Bugzilla has
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1231816> (CVE-2015-1850)
for the nova issue and similarly
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1231817> (CVE-2015-1851)
for the cinder issue. Is this correct?

Regards and thanks in advance,
Salvatore
