Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/09/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, September 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 45 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 45.0.2454.85 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/44.0.2403.157..45.0.2454.85?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 45.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [29 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M45). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[526825](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=526825)] CVE-2015-1301: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.5 branch (currently 4.5.103.29).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Issue [1189553002](/1189553002/): Omnibox: Force text field to LTR context if it is a URL. (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 6 months ago by [Matt Giuca](/user/Matt%20Giuca)  **Modified:** 5 years, 6 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Peter Kasting](/user/Peter%20Kasting)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, tfarina, James Su, chrome-apps-syd-reviews\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | DescriptionOmnibox: Force text field to LTR context if it is a URL. This means that URLs will be displayed in a left-to-right paragraph context. Right-to-left runs are still rendered RTL, but will not flip the whole URL around. For example (if "ABC" is Hebrew), this will render "ABC.com" as "CBA.com", rather than "com.CBA". This is consistent with the behaviour in the Omnibox drop-down items (OmniboxResultView::CreateClassifiedRenderText) and status bubble (StatusBubbleViews::SetURL).

The main problem is that there seems to be some kind of heuristic to decide between picking a URL result or a Google Search result in the Omnibox. Whichever one ends up on top determines whether the text field "is a URL" or not. This tends to oscillate back and forth unpredictably. This is already a bit jarring (even without my patch), but you're right, this feels pretty weird when using bidi text.  Here's an example: paste into the browser (without quotes) "שנב.בםצ/xyz" then hit the End key, and start typing a sentence consisting of ASCII letters and spaces, or ASCII letters and slashes. In both cases, it will oscillate between being a URL and not being a URL, which after my patch, flips the Hebrew bit from the left to the right side.  So what can we do? I don't really want to revert this* because it's a security issue. Can we possibly make the Omnibox selection heuristic more stable? Look at a similar ASCII-only example:  Type: "abc.def/ghi" and then type a sequence of letters, spaces and slashes. You will see it oscillating between Google Search and URL, which makes the result list flicker back and forth, and also the non-domain parts of the URL flickering between black and grey.  The other solution would be to only force LTR when the URL is in "permanent" (confirmed) mode, not during editing. I tried that initially and I was dissatisfied with the fact that the URL looked different during editing to after confirmation. But that is an option.  * I mean I'm happy to temporarily while we figure out what to do, but I don't want to leave this unfixed. ```     | **Peter Kasting** | | On 2015/06/17 03:16:03, Matt Giuca wrote: > Type: "abc.def/ghi" and then type a sequence of ... | | --- | | 5 years, 6 months ago (2015-06-17 04:36:18 UTC) [#16](#msg16) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` On 2015/06/17 03:16:03, Matt Giuca wrote: > Type: "abc.def/ghi" and then type a sequence of letters, spaces and slashes.

I think this is mostly because of bug 418009.  I CCed you there and wrote up some thoughts.  Mark is going on leave soon so it may make sense to have you try and take over his fix for that bug if he can't get to it. ```     | **Matt Giuca** | | OK I've got a bit on my plate at the moment but I might be ... | | --- | | 5 years, 6 months ago (2015-06-17 05:39:47 UTC) [#17](#msg17) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` OK I've got a bit on my plate at the moment but I might be able to help out.

If we don't manage to land anything else, I probably would not ship this to 45.  Even if we land a fix for that bug we may find the behavior still feels icky, but we'll see.  It's a security issue, but it's also one we've had for all time, so I'm willing to take longer to get it right if need be. ```     Expand Messages | Collapse Messages | Show Generated Messages | Hide Generated Messages |

## Issue [1180393003](/1180393003/): Added characters that look like padlocks to URL unescaping blacklist. (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 6 months ago by [Matt Giuca](/user/Matt%20Giuca)  **Modified:** 5 years, 6 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Peter Kasting](/user/Peter%20Kasting), [jam](/user/jam), [mmenke](/user/mmenke)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, cbentzel+watch\_chromium.org, chrome-apps-syd-reviews\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | DescriptionAdded characters that look like padlocks to URL unescaping blacklist. This blacklists the following Unicode characters: - U+1F50F LOCK WITH INK PEN - U+1F510 CLOSED LOCK WITH KEY - U+1F512 LOCK - U+1F513 OPEN LOCK This prevents LOCK characters from appearing in a URL in the Chrome UI, potentially looking like an SSL padlock icon (e.g., "google.com/🔒" is now displayed as "google.com/%F0%9F%94%92"). This presented a spoofing risk due to a few complications: 1. In RTL mode, the end of the URL (path/query) is aligned right up against the right edge of the Omnibox, where the SSL padlock is usually displayed. 2. On Mac, ChromeOS, and Android, LOCK characters are displayed in colour, making them more convincing. Note: These characters will still be unescaped when using the SPOOFING\_AND\_CONTROL\_CHARS unescape rule (used for decoding data URLs, previously known as CONTROL\_CHARS).

It's a layering violation for net/ to know about anything in content/ (Which includes things like the UI thread and IO thread...as well as the fact its primary use case is being used in a browser).

OK well the entire reason for these chars being banned is that they clash with web browser UI, so it doesn't make sense for this comment *not* to mention web browsers. (ie. if you use this module in a non-web-browser app, then the locks probably don't need to be banned.)

The whole point of this function is to prepare a URL for display, so this objection seems a bit odd.  > Also control chars aren't dangerous per se, some of them probably > would just show as boxes.  Embedded control characters could change the appearance and function of the URL either in Chrome or in other applications you copied and pasted the URL to.  I don't think "characters might show as boxes" is the limit of the danger here, even in the omnibox.  > What these all have in common is that they are > characters that should not be displayed in UI (all the documentation surrounding > CONTROL_CHARS says "don't use this if you are going to display them in the UI"), > so I think NON_DISPLAY_CHARS is an appropriate name and could later be expanded > to include other things that shouldn't be displayed, like non-breaking spaces. >  > WDYT?  I don't like NON_DISPLAY_CHARS (sorry...).  I think it reads as "non-displaying characters", e.g. control characters, zero-width characters, soft hyphens, etc.  But these banned characters are displaying characters.

No it isn't, it's used about equally for the two purposes of a) preparing a URL for display, and b) decoding binary data that was encoded in a URL (like data: URLs). The distinction at the call site is that in case (a) you do not use CONTROL_CHARS, and in case (b), you do use CONTROL_CHARS.  So it seemed appropriate to rename CONTROL_CHARS to NON_DISPLAY_CHARS, for times where you are not preparing a URL for display.  > I don't like NON_DISPLAY_CHARS (sorry...).

Fair enough.  > I think either of my original suggestions is clearer.  I still don't like DANGEROUS_CHARS because it implies that a client using this function for use case (b) (decoding a data URL) is doing something dangerous. Whereas in fact it is perfectly safe as long as you don't display the decoded string in a context of a URL.

How I think of it: That second case _is_ preparing the URL for display.  You're prepping a data: URL for display as data, to be displayed to the user in the content area.

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1291, CVE-2015-1292, CVE-2015-1293, CVE-2015-1294,
CVE-2015-1295, CVE-2015-1296, CVE-2015-1297, CVE-2015-1298, CVE-2015-1299,
CVE-2015-1300, CVE-2015-1301)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 45.0.2454.85, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

# CVE-2015-1296

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1295.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1297.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1296 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1296)

#### Description

The UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl implementation in net/base/escape.cc in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not prevent display of Unicode LOCK characters in the omnibox, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof the SSL lock icon by placing one of these characters at the end of a URL, as demonstrated by the omnibox in localizations for right-to-left languages.
