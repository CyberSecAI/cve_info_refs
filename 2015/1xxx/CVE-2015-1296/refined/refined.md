    "description": "The UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl implementation in net/base/escape.cc in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not prevent display of Unicode LOCK characters in the omnibox, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof the SSL lock icon by placing one of these characters at the end of a URL, as demonstrated by the omnibox in localizations for right-to-left languages.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl` function in `net/base/escape.cc` did not properly handle or blacklist Unicode LOCK characters, allowing them to be displayed in the omnibox.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Unicode character handling vulnerability",
         "Spoofing vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could spoof the SSL lock icon in the browser's omnibox by embedding a lookalike Unicode character within the displayed URL, potentially deceiving users into thinking a connection is secure when it is not. This can lead to phishing and other attacks relying on user trust.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker crafts a URL that includes Unicode LOCK characters which when displayed in the address bar/omnibox of the browser make the user believe the site is secure (SSL lock icon). The vulnerable client application would then render the URL, displaying the look-alike SSL lock.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and deliver them to the victim user through any medium the user can use to open the URL with the affected browser."

    "description": "The WebRequest API implementation in extensions/browser/api/web_request/web_request_api.cc in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not properly consider a request's source before accepting the request, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted (1) app or (2) extension.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The WebRequest API implementation in `extensions/browser/api/web_request/web_request_api.cc` did not properly validate or consider the source of a web request before accepting it.

This can allow the attacker to intercept network requests, modify data in transit or potentially execute malicious code within the context of other extensions or applications.",
