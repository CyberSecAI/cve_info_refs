[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1712)

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1291, CVE-2015-1292, CVE-2015-1293, CVE-2015-1294,
CVE-2015-1295, CVE-2015-1296, CVE-2015-1297, CVE-2015-1298, CVE-2015-1299,
CVE-2015-1300, CVE-2015-1301)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 45.0.2454.85, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

CVE-2015-6581 Double free vulnerability in the opj_j2k_copy_default_tcp_and_create_tcd function in j2k.c  Double free vulnerability in the opj_j2k_copy_default_tcp_and_create_tcd function in j2k.c in OpenJPEG before r3002, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) by triggering a memory-allocation failure.   CVE-2015-6582 possible denial of service in Blink  The decompose function in platform/transforms/TransformationMatrix.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, does not verify that a matrix inversion succeeded, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/09/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, September 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 45 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 45.0.2454.85 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/44.0.2403.157..45.0.2454.85?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 45.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [29 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M45). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[526825](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=526825)] CVE-2015-1301: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.5 branch (currently 4.5.103.29).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

## Description

[![@igrigorik](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10652?u=978457b974ccc4bbf423f4c9d1e844632a18f710&v=4&size=48)](/igrigorik)[igrigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)opened [on Jul 20, 2015](https://github.com/w3c/resource-timing/issues/29#issue-96140207)

History records the redirected-to URL and triggering `history.back()` on an iframe creates a ResourceTiming object with `name` attribute set to said URL.

* PoC: <http://vwzq.net/lab/xreadurl/> - FF, IE, Chrome all have the same issue.
* Chrome bug: <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=511616>
* History traversal: <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#traverse-the-history-by-a-delta>

> name: This attribute must return the resolved URL of the requested resource. This attribute must not change even if the fetch redirected to a different URL -- [current definition](http://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#widl-PerformanceResourceTiming-name).

Similarly, our processing section [records the resolved URL](http://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#process) of the requested resource. As such, I don't believe this is a RT spec bug, but the fact that all implementations are subject to this does indicate that we may want to add some language to make this explicit.
