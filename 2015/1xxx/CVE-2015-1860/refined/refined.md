Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2015-1860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of malformed GIF images within the Qt library. Specifically, it's a buffer overflow issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The Qt library fails to properly validate or sanitize the size and structure of GIF image data, allowing for a buffer overflow when processing a specially crafted, malformed GIF image. This buffer overflow is the primary vulnerability that can lead to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the Qt application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, the overflow could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This means an attacker could run malicious software by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted GIF Images:** The attack vector involves tricking a user or an automated system into opening a malicious GIF image. This could be achieved through various methods, including:
    *   Email attachments
    *   Malicious websites
    *   Instant messages
    *   Other file-sharing methods

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not require physical access to the targeted system.
*   **Ability to deliver a malicious GIF:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver or lure the user into opening the crafted GIF image.
*   **Targeted System Vulnerable:** The targeted system must be using a vulnerable version of the Qt library that is susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information confirms this vulnerability alongside other similar issues within Qt (CVE-2014-0190, CVE-2015-0295, CVE-2015-1858 and CVE-2015-1859) related to malformed BMP and ICO images.
*   The vulnerability was addressed with security updates to the Qt library.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-2626-1) and Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201603-10) highlight that both Qt4 and Qt5 versions were affected, emphasizing the need to update corresponding packages (`qt4-x11` and `qtbase-opensource-src`).
* The advisory details specific versions of packages that include the fix for the vulnerabilities.
