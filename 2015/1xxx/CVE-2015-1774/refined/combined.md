FOSDEM is one of the largest meetups for free and open source software projects, and it takes place every year in Brussels at the ULB Solbosch campus. This year it’ll be on 1 and 2 February – and, of course, LibreOffice and The Document Foundation will be there! Our [stand](https://fosdem.org/2025/stands/) will be in in K level 1, so come by and have a chat, grab some merchandise (stickers, pens, flyers, beer/coffee mats), and [support us with a donation](https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/) if you like 😊

But we know that many users are interested in combining AI tools with the suite, so we talked to John Balis who is working on a (fully optional!) LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here’s what he had to say…**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc’s chart topic – in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.…

**Marcial Machado recently [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/1hf4sqo/i_made_an_impress_template_in_native_opt_to_play/) about his “fully-featured LibreOffice Impress template for creating Jeopardy-style games. Just add your questions and categories, and you’re good to go!” So let’s find out more…**

### What does the template do?

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.…

[CVE-2015-1774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-1774)

[Apache OpenOffice Advisory](https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2015-1774.html)

**Out-of-Bounds Write in HWP File Filter**

**Version 2.0**

Announced April 27, 2015

Updated October 28, 2015

A vulnerability in OpenOffice's HWP filter allows attackers to craft
malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary
code.

**Severity: Important**

**Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation**

**Versions Affected**

All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.

OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.

**Mitigation**

Update to Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 or a later version.

This mitigation drops Apache OpenOffice support for documents
created in "Hangul Word Processor" format. The filter is not
installed; it will not be used if present.

**Workarounds and Document Migration**

Users of older HWP-format documents that are already trusted should
convert those documents to other formats before removing the filter
or upgrading to Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2.

Apache OpenOffice users who do not upgrade can remove the
problematic filter themselves. The filter is in the "program"
folder of their OpenOffice installation. On **Windows**
the filter is named "hwp.dll", on **Mac OS X** it is named
"libhwp.dylib" and on **Linux** it is named "libhwp.so".
Alternatively the filter can be renamed to anything else (e.g.
"hwp\_renamed.dll") to disable its use.

**Further Information**

For additional information and assistance, consult the
[Apache OpenOffice Community Forums](https://forum.openoffice.org/)
or make requests to the
users@openoffice.apache.org
public mailing list.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1458)

## Topic

Updated libreoffice packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

LibreOffice is an open source, community-developed office productivity
suite. It includes key desktop applications, such as a word processor, a
spreadsheet, a presentation manager, a formula editor, and a drawing
program. LibreOffice replaces OpenOffice and provides a similar but
enhanced and extended office suite.

A flaw was found in the way the LibreOffice HWP (Hangul Word Processor)
file filter processed certain HWP documents. An attacker able to trick a
user into opening a specially crafted HWP document could possibly use this
flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening that
document. (CVE-2015-1774)

The libreoffice packages have been upgraded to upstream version 4.2.8.2,
which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
version, including:

* OpenXML interoperability has been improved.
* This update adds additional statistics functions to the Calc application,

thus improving interoperability with Microsoft Excel and its "Analysis
ToolPak" add-in.

* Various performance improvements have been implemented in Calc.
* This update adds new import filters for importing files from the Appple

Keynote and Abiword applications.

* The export filter for the MathML markup language has been improved.
* This update adds a new start screen that includes thumbnails of recently

opened documents.

* A visual clue is now displayed in the Slide Sorter window for slides with

transitions or animations.

* This update improves trend lines in charts.
* LibreOffice now supports BCP 47 language tags.

For a complete list of bug fixes and enhancements provided by this rebase,
see the libreoffice change log linked from the References section.
(BZ#1150048)

Users of libreoffice are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

[CVE-2015-1774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-1774)

[Apache OpenOffice Advisory](https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2015-1774.html)

**Out-of-Bounds Write in HWP File Filter**

**Version 2.0**

Announced April 27, 2015

Updated October 28, 2015

A vulnerability in OpenOffice's HWP filter allows attackers to craft
malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary
code.

**Severity: Important**

**Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation**

**Versions Affected**

All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.

OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.

**Mitigation**

Update to Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 or a later version.

This mitigation drops Apache OpenOffice support for documents
created in "Hangul Word Processor" format. The filter is not
installed; it will not be used if present.

**Workarounds and Document Migration**

Users of older HWP-format documents that are already trusted should
convert those documents to other formats before removing the filter
or upgrading to Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2.

Apache OpenOffice users who do not upgrade can remove the
problematic filter themselves. The filter is in the "program"
folder of their OpenOffice installation. On **Windows**
the filter is named "hwp.dll", on **Mac OS X** it is named
"libhwp.dylib" and on **Linux** it is named "libhwp.so".
Alternatively the filter can be renamed to anything else (e.g.
"hwp\_renamed.dll") to disable its use.

**Further Information**

For additional information and assistance, consult the
[Apache OpenOffice Community Forums](https://forum.openoffice.org/)
or make requests to the
users@openoffice.apache.org
public mailing list.

**Credits**

\*\* This privacy policy is currently being adopted and may not yet be fully implemented at all websites \*\*

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).
With regard to the terminology we use, e.g. âProcessingâ or âResponsibleâ,
we refer to the definitions in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Name and contact details of the controller and the company data protection officer

This privacy policy applies to data processing by:

Responsible:

The Apache Software Foundation

V. P. Data Privacy

1000 N West Street, Suite 1200

Wilmington, DE 19801

U.S.A.

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called âcontract processing contractâ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

the service supports the GDPR which is also reflected in the DPA.
Read more about the privacy policy of Kapa.AI at [their website](https://www.kapa.ai/content/privacy-policy).

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeâs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectâs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeâs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

## 9. Data security

We use the popular SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method during your site visit, in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
In general, this is a 256-bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is encrypted is shown by the closed representation of the key or lock icon in the lower status bar of your browser.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

### Background

Apache OpenOffice is the leading open-source office software suite for
word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases and
more.

LibreOffice is a powerful office suite; its clean interface and powerful
tools let you unleash your creativity and grow your productivity.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in both LibreOffice and OpenOffice
that allow the remote execution of arbitrary code and potential Denial of
Service. These vulnerabilities may be exploited through multiple vectors
including crafted documents, link handling, printer setup in ODF document
types, DOC file formats, and Calc spreadsheets. Please review the
referenced CVE’s for specific information regarding each.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using the LibreOffice or OpenOffice suite of software. Execution of
these attacks could possibly result in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

All LibreOffice users should upgrade their respective packages to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.4.2"
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.4.2"# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-debug-4.4.2"

```

All OpenOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-4.1.2"

```

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3236-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : libreoffice
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1774

It was discovered that missing input sanitising in Libreoffice's filter
for HWP documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed document is opened.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u4.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

  + Stable batch generation of cropped SVG images. Examples: [Images with LibreLogo source code](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3AImages_with_LibreLogo_source_code).
  + Optional looping of SVG animations (it needs only a SLEEP command after the last shape). [Animated maze](/images/5/5a/Animated_maze.svg "Animated maze.svg") (checked in Mozilla Firefox 20.0), and its [source code](/File%3AAnimated_maze.svg "File:Animated maze.svg").
  + Relative SVG image path of PICTURE is relative to the path of the document (if it exists).
* Wildcards in autocorrection [tdf#68373](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68373) [tdf#77603](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77603) (László Németh)
  + Input field “Replace” of Autocorrection settings: “Enter the word or abbreviation that you want to replace while you type. Wildcard character sequence .\* in the end of word results the replacement of the word before arbitrary suffixes, too. Wildcard character sequence .\* before the word results the replacement after arbitrary prefixes, too. For example, the pattern "i18n.\*" with the replacement text "internationalization" will find and replace "i18ns" with "internationalizations", or the pattern ".\*..." with the replacement text "…" will find and replace three dots in "word..." with the typographically correct precomposed Unicode horizontal ellipsis ("word…").”
  + NOTE: before LibreOffice 4.2.4, this wildcard was only an \*. This character was changed to the sequence .\* (dot asterisk, similar to the regular expression pattern) in LibreOffice 4.2.4.

## Base

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: a checkbox bound to a (var)char (string) field will now write 'true' or 'false', whereas up to LibreOffice 4.1 it wrote the strings '1' or '0'. The read behaviour is backwards compatible and will recognise values '1' or '0'. (Lionel Elie Mamane)
* NEW FEATURE: reference values in checkboxes are now honoured. This allows to have again the old behaviour of writing '1' or '0' if desired. It also allows e.g. to invert the behaviour of the checkbox (bound to a boolean field) by setting the checkbox properties as follows 'Reference (on): false' and 'Reference (off): true' (Lionel Elie Mamane)

## Options / General

### Windows Registry changes

Windows Registry as a configuration backend. Under Windows, LibreOffice uses keys under HKLM/Policies/LibreOffice as a configuration layer on the top of program's layer and below user's layer.

The following structure is assumed:
Last element of Key becomes prop, first part is the path and optionally nodes, when the node has oor:op attribute. Values can be the following: Value (string) and Final (dword, optional)
For example the following registry setting:

```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\LibreOffice\org.openoffice.UserProfile\Data\o]
"Value"="Example Corp."
"Final"=dword:00000001

```

becomes the following in configuration:

```
<item oor:path="/org.openoffice.UserProfile/Data">
    <prop oor:name="o" oor:finalized="true">
        <value>Example Corp.</value>
    </prop>
</item>

```

Another example:

```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Policies\LibreOffice\org.openoffice.Office.OptionsDialog\OptionsDialogGroups\ProductName/#fuse\Pages\BasicIDEOptions/#fuse\Hide]
"Value"="true"

```

becomes the following in configuration:

```
<item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.OptionsDialog/OptionsDialogGroups">
    <node oor:name="ProductName" oor:op="fuse">
        <node oor:name="Pages">
            <node oor:name="BasicIDEOptions" oor:op="fuse">
                <prop oor:name="Hide">
                    <value>true</value>
                </prop>
            </node>
        </node>
    </node>
</item>

```

Third example (property of an extensible group -> needs type):

```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\LibreOffice\org.openoffice.Office.Jobs\Jobs\org.openoffice.Office.Jobs:Job['UpdateCheck']\Arguments\AutoCheckEnabled]
"Value"="false"
"Final"=dword:00000001
"Type"="xs:boolean"

```

becomes the following in configuration:

```
<item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.Jobs/Jobs/org.openoffice.Office.Jobs:Job['UpdateCheck']/Arguments">
    <prop oor:name="AutoCheckEnabled" oor:type="xs:boolean" oor:finalized="true">
        <value>false</value>
    </prop>
</item>

```

With this feature it becomes possible to centrally manage LibreOffice configuration with Group Policy Objects in a Windows domain. It is possible set and optionally lock many LibreOffice settings. The feature was developed by the order of Hungarian [E-Governmental Free Software Competence Centre](http://szabadszoftver.kormany.hu/about-us/).

### Improved language tools (spell-check dictionaries, thesaurus, hyphenation patterns)

[Information taken from dictionary repository](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/log/?h=libreoffice-4-2):

* Greatly improved German language tools (de-AT, de-CH, de-DE) with over 10,000 new words added to the German spell-check dictionary and updated hyphenation patterns. For the first time, the German thesaurus exceeds 100,000 words in over 28,000 meaning groups.
* Lao (lo\_LA) spell-check dictionary added.
* Brazilian Portuguese (pt\_BR) spell-check dictionary updated.(Raimundo Moura, Marcos Paulo de Souza and Alexandre Vicenzi)
* Spanish spell-check dictionary updated.
* Swedish spell-check dictionary updated.
* French spell-check dictionary updated.
* Dutch spell-check dictionary updated.
* Scottish Gaelic (gd\_GB) spell-check dictionary updated.
* Slovenian thesaurus updated. (Martin Srebotnjak)

* Latvia adopted the Euro on 2014-01-01, related changes: [tdf#73239](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73239) (Eike Rathke)
  + Added 'EUR' currency to [lv-LV] and [ltg-LV] locale data and made it their default currency.
  + Added 'LVL' Latvian Lats to the Euro Converter (File ▸ Wizards ▸ Euro Converter...).
  + Added "LVL" conversion factor 0.702804 to the Calc EUROCONVERT() spreadsheet function.
* Also added the Estonian Kroon "EEK" conversion factor 15.6466 to the Calc EUROCONVERT() spreadsheet function.

## Experimental Features

* Added an experimental feature of live data streaming (Data ▸ Streams...). This feature is still highly experimental, and is disabled by default. You need to check the Enable experimental features option to enable this feature. (Matúš Kukan, Kohei Yoshida)

[![](/images/thumb/3/37/CalcDataStreamDlg42.png/445px-CalcDataStreamDlg42.png)](/File%3ACalcDataStreamDlg42.png) Data stream dialog

* NEW TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW FEATURE: Firebird SQL connector for LibreOffice Base (Andrzej Hunt). When creating a new Database, select Firebird Embedded in the drop down menu (you have to first enable the Experimental features in Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced). This allows creation of databases that perform many times faster than the previous built-in HSQLDB 1.8, avoiding the C++-to-Java overhead inherent in using HSQLDB. We plan to phase HSQLDB out over the next few releases, and provide a smooth migration path to Firebird. Connecting to modern HSQLDB 2.x external databases remains available through HSQLDB's native interface, namely JDBC.

**Start of a few words about Firebird, please feel free to improve following description of Firebird:** "The integration of Firebird in LibreOffice Base is a big step forward. Firebird is a mature relational SQL database that is ACID-compliant and boasts cross-platform support, multi-generation architecture, referential integrity, logging and monitoring capabilities. It offers high performance, excellent concurrency and powerful language support for stored procedures and triggers, and more. It has been used in production systems, under a variety of names, since 1981."

[![](/images/5/5a/FirebirdDB.png)](/File%3AFirebirdDB.png) Firebird Embedded

* On Windows there is a new experimental accessibility bridge supporting IAccessible2 (IA2), based on code from IBM. By default the legacy Java Access Bridge (JAB) will be used, and Experimental features in Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced switches to the new IA2 bridge; in LO 4.3 the JAB will be removed in favour of IA2. Please check that your accessibility tool supports IA2 before trying it out; [NVDA](http://www.nvaccess.org/) is known to work. For more details see [Development/ia2](/Development/ia2 "Development/ia2").

## Performance

### Calc

* Calc's cell storage structure has been completely re-written, to store contiguous cell values in contiguous memory region to improve locality of reference as well as the cost of storage. The new structure also enables hardware accelerated parallel calculations of a large number of cells. (Kohei Yoshida)
* Calc core now shares all string instances stored in cells and several other places in order to significantly speed up both case sensitive and case insensitive string comparisons, and also to allow string equality check in OpenCL-based formula interpreter. This change also speeds up execution of several cell functions (such as VLOOKUP) that perform a large number of string equality comparisons. Filtering of rows via AutoFilter, Standard Filter, and Advanced Filter should run faster thanks to shared strings. (Kohei Yoshida)
* Vertically adjacent formula cells containing identical formula token set now share their formula token array instance. This can drastically reduce run-time memory usage of Calc, and also speeds up automatic reference updates when moving cells. (Kohei Yoshida)
* XLSX import filter has been re-worked to achieve significant boost on the import performance on XLSX documents. The speed up was achieved by moving much of the temporary string allocations and deallocations that occur during the XML parsing phase to a separate thread, and also by re-working the handler logic on the Calc side to reduce inefficiencies, especially with regard to importing of formula cells. (Kohei Yoshida, Michael Meeks, Matúš Kukan)
* Added an experimental multi-threaded import for XLSX documents. When the experimental features are enabled, Calc tries to import XLSX documents using multiple threads, to import multiple sheets concurrently. (Kohei Yoshida, Michael Meeks)
* Significant speed up on the export of ODS document that contains a large number of rich-text cells. Refer to [this blog post](http://kohei.us/2013/08/26/speedier-export-of-rich-text-cells/) for more details. (Kohei Yoshida)
* Cell note storage has been re-worked to use multi\_type\_vector, in order to improve the performance of import and export of documents containing large number of cell comments. (Laurent Godard)
* Improved performance of VLOOKUP function with use of external references. (Pierre-Eric Pelloux-Prayer)
* Improved performance of SUM, COUNT, and SUMIFS function. (Kohei Yoshida)

## Infrastructure

* Added 64-bit builds for macOS.
* New experimental liblibreoffice API that allows (initially) LibreOffice's filters to be re-used by directly linking to the LibreOffice core. This has a simple [C](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/desktop/inc/liblibreoffice.h) and wrapper [C++](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/desktop/inc/liblibreoffice.hxx) API, and brings no run-time dependency (via a very tiny static library / shim) (Michael Meeks)
* Symbols & source server for LibreOffice on Windows.

* When a bug is experienced on Windows, it is now easy to get a backtrace or more information about that via Symbols Server and Source Server. (Fridrich Štrba, Luboš Luňák, Jan Holešovský, Christian Lohmaier)
* More info on [how to use it](/How_to_get_a_backtrace_with_WinDbg "How to get a backtrace with WinDbg").
## Scripting / Base

* LibreOffice now bundles [Access2Base](http://www.access2base.com/), a simplified API for scripting of Base (and Writer database forms) in the Basic programming language. It is more concise and easier to learn than the cross-language standard UNO API.

### Autodoc replaced by doxygen

The SDK no longer contains the autodoc documentation tool [9d93ed7cd1b36830f6d7aedd4e6f15667774de1d](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/9d93ed7cd1b36830f6d7aedd4e6f15667774de1d).

IDL API documentation can be extracted by doxygen version 1.8.4 or later instead.
Download it from <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html>

There are some differences in the documentation markup between autodoc and doxygen; the warnings printed by doxygen are helpful in finding comments that need tweaking.

### uno-skeletonmaker

The obsolete `--java4` command line parameter was removed from the `uno-skeletonmaker` tool [3cb10e9220da27ca7db2f68007be9e310bdefc4d](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/3cb10e9220da27ca7db2f68007be9e310bdefc4d)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Using the default gtk save dialog, I don't see the remote share there. Using the LibreOffice dialog I'm not able to create the remote share.  Opening document on remote share from nautilus results in empty document in LO.  Tried sftp and smb.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): libreoffice-4.2.8.2-8.el6  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a remote share; Places > Connect to Server ... 2. Create new document and save to remote share. 3.  Actual results: Cannot save, remote share is not accessible from save dialog  Expected results: Document is saved on remote share.

# USN-2578-1: LibreOffice vulnerabilities

27 April 2015

LibreOffice could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libreoffice](/security/cves?package=libreoffice) - Office productivity suite

## Details

Alexander Cherepanov discovered that LibreOffice incorrectly handled

certain RTF files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

RTF document, a remote attacker could cause LibreOffice to crash, and

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-9093](/security/CVE-2014-9093))

It was discovered that LibreOffice incorrectly handled certain HWP files.

If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted HWP document, a

remote attacker could cause LibreOffice to crash, and possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1774](/security/CVE-2015-1774))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:4.3.7~rc2-0ubuntu1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A4.3.7~rc2-0ubuntu1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:4.2.8-0ubuntu2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A4.2.8-0ubuntu2)

  -
  [1:3.5.7-0ubuntu8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A3.5.7-0ubuntu8)

After a standard system update you need to restart LibreOffice to make all

the necessary changes.
