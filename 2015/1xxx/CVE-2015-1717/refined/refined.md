This document provides details for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2015-1717.

**CVE-2015-1717: Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper memory handling leads to memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption due to improper object handling.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit this website through methods such as:
    *   Tricking the user into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
    *   Compromising legitimate websites and injecting malicious content.
    *   Using websites hosting user-provided content or advertisements.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted website and entice users to visit it, and no user interaction beyond simply browsing to the malicious page is required.
