{
  "CVE-2015-1350": {
    "description": "The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 3.x provides an incomplete set of requirements for setattr operations that underspecifies removing extended privilege attributes, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (capability stripping) via a failed invocation of a system call, as demonstrated by using chown to remove a capability from the ping or Wireshark dumpcap program.",
    "root_cause": "The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle the removal of extended privilege attributes during setattr operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete requirements for setattr operations",
      "Underspecification of removing extended privilege attributes"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users could cause a denial of service (capability stripping). Applications relying on capabilities would fail.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local users can trigger the vulnerability with a failed system call."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access"
