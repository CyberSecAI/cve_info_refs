# Security Bulletin: Missing authorization concept for document upload and download in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) CMIS integration (CVE-2015-1904)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Business Process Manager offers integration with external Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems. If a process app is configured to always connect to an external ECM system using a predefined technical system account (rather than the actual end user), then the process app developer has no way of controlling access to upload or download functions for documents in the external ECM system.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-1904](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1904) IBM Business Process Manager offers integration with external Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems. If a process app is configured to always connect to an external ECM system using a predefined technical system account (rather than the actual end user), then the process app developer has no way of controlling access to upload or download functions for documents in the external ECM system.

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101728> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.x through V8.5.6.0

## Remediation/Fixes

Install the interim fix for APAR JR53209 as appropriate for your current IBM Business Process Manager version.

* [IBM Business Process Manager Express](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR53209)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Standard](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR53209)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Advanced](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR53209)

This fix introduces a server-side configuration option to enable/disable a customizable security service. This service can check the permission of a user and can be created and selected using the new service selector labeled "External ECM Document Authorization Service". It is added to the Server Settings for the added Enterprise Content Manager Server(s) and is needed for server definitions with the "Always use this connection information" checkbox enabled.

The service is used by the Document List and Document Viewer coach views from the Content Management (SYSCM) toolkit when they perform operations that cannot be customized using an Ajax Service. These operations are the creation, update, and download of a document. The service is not used when you directly invoke the Content Integration operation from a human service, Ajax service, and integration service.

This service should have the following signature:

Input parameters:

1. documentId (ECMID)

2. objectTypeId (ECMID)

3. action (String) The actions available for creating, downloading, and updating external ECM documents are: "ACTION\_CREATE\_DOCUMENT", "ACTION\_GET\_DOCUMENT\_CONTENT", and "ACTION\_UPDATE\_DOCUMENT" respectively.

4. serverName (String)

Output parameter:

1. authorized (Boolean)

The following example is a sample configuration of new option, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file:

<server>

<!-- enable the document authorization security service -->

<enable-document-authorization-security-service>true</enable-document-authorization-security-service>

</server>

For more information, see “[Changing server properties in 100Custom.xml](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.0.1/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/changing_server_props.html)” and “[The 99Local.xml and 100Custom.xml configuration files](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.0.1/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/managing_twks_config_settings.html)”.

Note: The new configuration option is enabled and no service is defined by default. In order to continue using the Document List and Document Viewer coach views, the security service should either be created and implemented or it should be disabled by setting the configuration option mentioned above to false in the 100Custom.xml file.

## Error description

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) offers integration with
  external Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems. If a
  process app is configured to always connect to an external ECM
  system by using a predefined technical system account rather
  than the actual end user, the process app developer cannot
  prevent documents from being uploaded to or downloaded from the
  external ECM system.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
  IBM BPM Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  No additional information is available.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3, V8.5.0.1, V8.5.5.0, and
   V8.5.6.0 that introduces additional functionality to the
  product with the use of a server-side configuration option to
  enable or disable a customizable security service. This service
  can check the permission of a user and can be created and
  selected by using the new service selector labeled External ECM
  Document Authorization Service, which is added to the Server
  Settings for the added Enterprise Content Manager Servers and is
   necessary for server definitions with "Always use this
  connection information" enabled.

  The Document List and Document Viewer coach views use this
  service from the Content Management (SYSCM) toolkit when they
  creation, update, and download documents, which cannot be
  customized by using an Ajax service. The service is not used
  when you directly invoke the Content Integration operation from
  a human service, Ajax service, or integration service.

  This service should have the following signature:

  Input parameters
  -documentId (ECMID)
  -objectTypeId (ECMID)
  -action (String) The actions available for creating,
  downloading, and updating external ECM documents are:
  "ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT", "ACTION_GET_DOCUMENT_CONTENT", and
  "ACTION_UPDATE_DOCUMENT" respectively
  -serverName (String)

  Output parameter
  -authorized (Boolean)

  The following example is a sample configuration of the new
  property, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file:

  <server>
    <!-- enable the document authorization security service -->

  <enable-document-authorization-security-service>true</enable-doc
  ument-authorization-security-service>
  </server>

  For more information about changing server properties, see
  ?Changing server properties in 100Custom.xml?
  (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTDH_8.0.1/com.ibm
  .wbpm.admin.doc/topics/changing_server_props.html).

  Note: The new configuration option is enabled and no service is
  defined by default. To continue using the Document List and
  Document Viewer coach views, create or implement the security
  service or disable it by setting the configuration option
  previously mentioned to false in the 100Custom.xml file.
  However, setting this property to false disables the
  authorization service, which means Document List and Document
  Viewer coach views will work as before, without authorization
  for uploading and downloading documents from an ECM.

  On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
  for JR53209:

      1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition
  from the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
      2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR53209, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.
