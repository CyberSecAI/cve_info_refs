Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization concept for document upload and download within the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Content Management System (CMIS) integration.
- When a process application is configured to connect to an external Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system using a predefined technical system account (instead of the actual end-user's account), the process app developer loses control over access to document upload and download functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks when interacting with external ECM systems.
- **Use of Technical System Account:** The configuration that uses a predefined technical system account for ECM interaction bypasses user-specific access controls. This means that if a user has access to a process app, that user can bypass the permission on the ECM system and do unintended operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Document Access:** An attacker could potentially upload or download documents in the external ECM system without proper authorization.
- **Data Modification/Loss:** Depending on the ECM system and the attacker's intentions, this could lead to unauthorized modification or loss of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Exploitation of Process Application:** The attack vector involves exploiting a vulnerable process application within IBM BPM that uses the described ECM integration configured with a technical account.
- **Access to Process App:** The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable process application.
- **Bypassing User-Specific Permissions:** The attacker bypasses the permission settings of the ECM system by exploiting the technical system account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to a vulnerable IBM BPM application:** The attacker needs to be able to use a process application that is configured to connect to an external ECM system using a predefined technical system account.
- **Basic knowledge of how the process application interacts with the ECM system:** No specific expertise is needed, but the attacker must know what buttons/options to click to upload/download documents.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix for this vulnerability introduces a server-side configuration option to enable a customizable security service.
- This service allows checking of a user's permission before performing operations like document creation, update, and download within the external ECM.
- The fix introduces a new service selector labeled "External ECM Document Authorization Service" to be used when "Always use this connection information" checkbox is enabled.
- The security service has a defined signature with input parameters: documentId, objectTypeId, action, serverName, and output parameter: authorized (Boolean).
- The vulnerability affects IBM Business Process Manager versions 8.0.x through 8.5.6.0.
