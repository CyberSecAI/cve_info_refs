The provided content contains information about security vulnerabilities fixed in various Apple products. Specifically, CVE-2015-1104 is mentioned in the context of Kernel vulnerabilities and is addressed in Watch OS 1.0.1, iOS 8.3, Apple TV 7.2, and OS X Yosemite v10.10.3.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The system incorrectly treated some IPv6 packets from remote network interfaces as local packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of IPv6 packets from remote network interfaces.
- Failure to differentiate between local and remote network traffic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could bypass network filters. This could potentially allow an attacker to reach services that should not be exposed to the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted IPv6 packets from a remote network interface to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on a remote network and be able to send IPv6 packets to the target system.
