- **Root cause of vulnerability**: API methods (`get_repo`, `update_repo`, `get_locks`, `get_user_groups`) did not properly check for super-admin access, allowing users with API and read access to a repository to access other users' API keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure direct object reference due to insufficient permission checks within the API methods, leading to information disclosure of sensitive API keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain other users' API keys, including those of administrators, potentially gaining the ability to change system parameters and gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with API and read access to a repository could make API calls to the vulnerable endpoints to retrieve other user's API keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs an existing user account with API and read access to at least one repository.
