{
  "CVE-2015-1196": {
    "description": "GNU patch 2.7.1 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack in a patch file.",
    "root_cause": "The patch utility, when processing git-style patches, did not properly validate symlink targets, allowing creation of symlinks that pointed outside the intended working directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Improper symlink handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the user running the patch utility.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted patch file containing malicious symlink instructions. The user would then need to apply this patch file using the patch utility.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malicious patch file and trick the victim into applying it."
  }
}
