| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=904519#c0)  Jean Delvare   2014-11-08 14:55:25 UTC  ``` Until openSUSE 11.1, we carried a patch unified-reject-files.diff in our patch package, which implemented an option to generate reject files in unified format, including support for including the C function names. Since openSUSE 11.2, this patch was dropped because upstream implemented roughly the same feature. However the upstream implementation does not include C function names, so we lost that feature.  If would be great if the missing piece could be forward ported (and ideally sent upstream for inclusion.) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=904519#c1)  Jean Delvare   2014-11-10 09:57:02 UTC  ``` The upstream version of patch is actually supposed to handle this feature since March 2009:  2009-03-20  Andreas Gruenbacher  <agruen@suse.de>          * pch.c, pch.h (pch_c_function): New function.         * pch.c (p_c_function): New variable.         (another_hunk): Preserve the "diff -p" output.         * patch.c (abort_hunk): Use pch_c_function().         * tests/preserve-c-function-names: New test case.         * Makefile.in (TESTS): Add test case.  And it indeed works but only when the original patch file is in context format; it does not work when the original patch file is in unified format. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=904519#c2)  Jean Delvare   2014-11-10 10:36:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 612985](attachment.cgi?id=612985&action=diff "Preserve C function name in unified rejects") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=612985&action=edit "Preserve C function name in unified rejects") Preserve C function name in unified rejects ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=904519#c3)  Jean Delvare   2014-11-10 11:00:48 UTC  ``` Egbert, you can test the package at:  [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:tools/patch](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel%3Atools/patch) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=904519#c4)  Egbert Eich   2014-12-03 20:11:18 UTC  ``` Jean, thanks a lot!

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for patch
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0199-1
Rating: moderate
References: #904519 #913678
Cross-References: CVE-2015-1196
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update fixes the following security issue:
+ Security fix for a directory traversal flaw when handling git-style
patches. This could allow an attacker to
overwrite arbitrary files by applying a specially crafted patch.
[boo#913678] [CVE-2015-1196]
This update fixes the following issues:
+ When a file isn't being deleted because the file contents don't match
the patch, the resulting message is now "Not deleting file ... as
content differs from patch" instead of "File ... is not empty after
patch; not deleting".
+ Function names in hunks (from diff -p) are now preserved in reject
files [boo#904519]

Make sure symlinks don't point outside working directory (CVE-2015-119)When creating symlinks from git-style patches, make sure the symlinks don't
point above the current working directory. Otherwise, a subsequent patch could
use the symlink to write outside the working directory.
\* src/pch.c (symlink\_target\_is\_valid): New function to check for valid symlink
targets.
\* src/util.c (move\_file): Use symlink\_target\_is\_valid() here.
\* tests/symlinks: Add valid and invalid symlink test cases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182154#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-01-14 14:23:43 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the versions of the patch utility that support Git-style patches are vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by applying a specially crafted patch, with the privileges of the user running patch. A reproducer for this issue is available in [1].

In either case, you shouldn't be patching things as root unless they're trusted and possibly it's worth inspecting patch files first.  Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1182154#c16)  Vincent Danen    2015-07-31 04:47:40 UTC  ``` Also note that there was an incomplete fix to this that resulted in another CVE ([CVE-2015-1396](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1396)):  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1186764](show_bug.cgi?id=1186764 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2015-1396 patch: directory traversal via symlinks (incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1196)")  Given we have not fixed this, we're not vulnerable to the second incomplete-fix CVE either (noting for posterity if this is addressed in the future, to ensure that a complete fix is applied).   ``` |  |

patch now support git-style patches, which allows creating symlinks.
This feature can be abused for directory traversal. As a proof of
concept, applying the attached patch creates a file in /tmp:

$ ls /tmp/moo
/bin/ls: cannot access /tmp/moo: No such file or directory

$ mkdir empty && cd empty

$ patch -p1 < ~/traversal.diff
patching symbolic link tmp
patching file tmp/moo

$ ls /tmp/moo
/tmp/moo

 Yes, I know as I was the one who reported it to upstream. There are
two more important bugs that I wait fixes for. Will upload those as
soon as possible.

Thanks anyway,
