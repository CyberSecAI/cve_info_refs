Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Windows improperly processes specially crafted Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image format files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper processing of EMF files.
- This can lead to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.
- This can lead to:
    - Installation of programs.
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights.
    - Complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and convinces users to view the website. This can include compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
- **Email attack:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email or a specially crafted Office document as an attachment to an Outlook user, convincing the user to read the message or open the file.
- **Network share attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious image file on a network share and convinces users to navigate to the folder using Windows Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create specially crafted EMF files.
- Ability to host malicious content (website, email, network share).
- Ability to convince users to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visiting a website, opening a file or email, navigating to a network share.)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for affected systems.
- A workaround involving disabling metafile processing is provided, but it may impact system functionality such as printing and displaying clip art.
- The vulnerability was addressed by correcting how Windows processes EMF files.
- Microsoft did not receive any information indicating the vulnerability had been publicly exploited before the security bulletin was issued.
