The Bittorrent-module seems to be responsible for this error. Unfortunately i don't have any knowledge in OCAML so i can't locate the source of the problem in detail.  A temporary fix for this is to add --disable-bittorrent to the ebuild, it compiled fine without bittorrent.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Xake    2004-06-22 05:09:42 UTC  ``` Changing patch_pack21g to patch_pack21f in the ebuild makes it compiles just fine.... So comparing the changes between patch_pack21g and patch_pack21f may give a bit of information what mait be wrong. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Xake    2004-06-22 07:08:03 UTC  ``` Hmm Do not know if it is only that thing that did it but  "ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge dev-lang/ocaml"  Did make it for me.

Emerging the (~x86) 2.5.21-r2 net-p2p/mldonkey resulted in an error in the bittorrent module.   Emerging the ~x86 dev-lang/ocaml (3.07-r1) first and then emerging mldonkey resulted in a different error, same as already posted before. BUT: using the 3.07-r1 ocaml AND the command   OCAMLRUNPARAM="l=256M" emerge -av net-p2p/mldonkey  everything compiled just fine. And yes, I have the -gtk USE flag set, but that is my default, so I didn't test it if that is the problem for the others. So, I hope you guys can get the new mldonkey version running with these tips here... ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Jason Kim    2004-06-24 17:14:00 UTC  ``` Having similar problems here, however I noticed this after the 'make depend' portion of the ebuild runs: File "src/networks/bittorrent/bTClients.ml", line 326, characters 0-34496: Lexing error: comment not terminated Preprocessing error  Line 326 of that file contains this: (*How much requests in the 'pipeline'*)  I have no knowledge of ocaml, and I tried to discover how it parses quotes in a comment, but didn't find anything after a quick search. Anyway, I pulled out the quotes and ran: # ebuild mldonkey-2.5.21-r2.ebuild compile # ebuild mldonkey-2.5.21-r2.ebuild merge with no problems at all.  For the record I'm emerging with USE="-gtk" and ocaml version 3.06-r1. I have looked at the work directory generated for mldonkey-2.5.21-r1, and that comment line exists there as well, but no error gets generated during the build (I've been using it for a while now).

I am using -O3 and know of many others who are, and it's working great for us. This is one of the best mldonkeys yet (sorry to rub it in for those who can't get it to compile). Could this possibly be a "non-working ocaml" problem? Could everyone who cannot get the latest mldonkey working please post their "emerge --info" for me, too? We need to hunt this sucker down! ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-28 18:41:46 UTC  ``` I just installed mldonkey-2.5.21-r2 on a stable x86 system this time. I just made some little changes to the ebuild- please resync and try to merge it again and let me know if it works (yet). It's worked on all systems I've tried...I can't figure out where it's botching for everyone else. If all else fails, try the latest (testing) version of ocaml and let me know if that works. ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  spiralvoice    2004-06-28 19:08:02 UTC  ``` Some comments about needed versions. In order to build the GTK GUI lablgtk-1.2.6 is required, the ebuild says "=dev-ml/lablgtk-1*". Lablgtk-1.2.6 is still masked but there is some code which requires this version.  Ocaml 3.07+pl2 is also a better guess, ebuild 2.5.16-r6 still uses Ocaml 3.06 which is not enough, 2-5-21 uses 3.07, please update both to ocaml-3.07-r1, but again, it is masked...  As there are known problems with 2-5-21 cores and patch development is currently focused on the 2-5-16 line new users should use this version. Unfortunately a downgrade from 2-5-21 to 2-5-16 forces user to delete files.ini and do a recover_temp, so losing incompletely downloaded chunks. ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  spiralvoice    2004-06-28 19:16:48 UTC  ``` ebuild 2-5-16-r6 does not execute autoconf after applying the patchpack and all ebuilds apply the gentoo-configure.patch before autoconf. But autoconf will overwrite config/configure so this patch is useless. The correct order should be: - unpack source - apply patchpack - cd config; autoconf; cd .. - apply configure patch if necessary, better post patch to Savannah with needed gentoo-patches for config/configure.in ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  spiralvoice    2004-06-28 19:25:09 UTC  ``` Yet another one: Please remove "make depend" from all ebuild as config/configure is doing the job already at the end of its turn. Having "make depend" in 2-5-16-r6 ebuild before ./configure shows errors because the original CVS makefile is still there... ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-28 19:48:56 UTC  ``` Thanks for your input, spiralvoice- your suggestions seem to work fine on all my systems and have been committed to portage. Please resync and try the latest versions of both branches. The latest .16 revision should have everything in order (patch removed and everything working well), and the latest .21 should depend on the correct requirements (patch removed). ```  [Comment 28](#c28)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-28 19:50:06 UTC  ``` sorry if there was confusion- the gentoo-configure patch was removed, not the patch_pack ```  [Comment 29](#c29)  spiralvoice    2004-06-29 16:02:44 UTC  ``` AFAICS ebuilds are looking good now. One small problem some users might stumble across is the lack of ed2k servers during first core start. Also getting working Overnet peers can be tricky, but both problems can easily be solved by providing this file: ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/mldonkey/pango/goodies/servers.ini.gz as unpacked version in the core's data directory. This file is well known in the MLDonkey community for having working Overnet peers, it is build daily.  One idea: Add parameter sighup to /etc/init.d/mldonkey so users can put this command into their ip-up scripts. Core performance increases if it is immediatly notified when an IP change takes place. Not restarting the core is faster and the core remembers when clients were connected so this avoids reconnecting too fast which can result in a ban. ```  [Comment 30](#c30)  rabbitambulance    2004-06-29 16:23:40 UTC  ``` it works quite nicely for me now. ```  [Comment 31](#c31)  spiralvoice    2004-06-30 07:53:12 UTC  ``` Please add RESTRICT="nomirror" to the ebuilds as the needed files are not located on Gentoo mirrors. ```  [Comment 32](#c32)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-30 08:18:15 UTC  ``` Which patchpack is missing on the gentoo mirrors? They should all be there. I have many tests and midterms at school until Friday, so I won't be very active until the weekend. About the servers.ini.gz file, are you suggesting having the ebuild download a copy of it and putting it in a shared directory, or just a note on the ebuild with your comment? ```  [Comment 33](#c33)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-08 09:26:38 UTC  ``` And with the final editings of the ocaml and mldonkey ebuilds, mldonkey-2.5.21 now emerges cleanly on all systems I have tested but will remain in ~x86. ``` |  |

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/05/stable-channel-update_19.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, May 19, 2015

The Chrome team is happy to announce the promotion of Chrome 43 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 43.0.2357.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements.  A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/42.0.2311.0..43.0.2357.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M43&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[489518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489518)] CVE-2015-1265: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.3 branch (currently 4.3.61.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2015-05-20 11:25:34 UTC  ``` ZDI-15-236:  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Google Chrome. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within SpeechRecognitionClient.   By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.

Right now we have only CVE numbers.  I think next time it would be sufficient to have just one chromium tracker bug and not one for each CVE. I'll keep that in mind. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c4)  Forgotten User sM9JzehKpy   2015-05-22 10:51:34 UTC  ``` Hi Alexander,  Well, actually I am checking on a daily basis if a new release of Chrome stable was released. If so, I will update the chromium package. Most of the time I only have the announcement of Google available and no bug reports yet. I then build the package in its devel repo. During this build period the bug reports appear.   But it would help a lot if these bugreports are not per CVE, but just for a new Chrome release. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c5)  Andreas Stieger   2015-05-29 14:40:25 UTC  ``` released ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=931659#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-05-29 15:06:28 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0969-1: An update that fixes 15 vulnerabilities is now available.
