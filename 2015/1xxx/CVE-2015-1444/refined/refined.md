Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1444:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2015-1444 is insufficient output sanitization in multiple scripts within the fli4l web administration interface. Specifically, the scripts `admin/conntrack.cgi`, `admin/index.cgi`, `admin/log_syslog.cgi`, `admin/problems.cgi`, `admin/status.cgi`, `admin/status_network.cgi`, and `admin/status_system.cgi` do not properly escape output, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities in multiple CGI scripts due to insufficient output escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Attack:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the browser of an authenticated user when they interact with the vulnerable web interface. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable CGI scripts.
*   The attacker would need to manipulate input or responses that are then reflected back to the user's browser without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to target an authenticated user of the fli4l web administration interface. The specific privileges required vary depending on the vulnerable script, but generally, any authenticated user can be a target, and some attacks require specific realm access.
*   **Network access:** The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the web administration interface.

**Affected Scripts:**
*   `admin/conntrack.cgi`
*   `admin/index.cgi`
*   `admin/log_syslog.cgi`
*   `admin/problems.cgi`
*   `admin/status.cgi`
*   `admin/status_network.cgi`
*   `admin/status_system.cgi`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory also mentions that the `admin/status_network.cgi` is additionally vulnerable to HTTP header injection.

This vulnerability is fixed in fli4l version 3.10.1 and later or in tarballs of development branch 4.0 from 2015-01-30 and later.
