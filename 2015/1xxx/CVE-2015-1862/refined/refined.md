  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2015-1862",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) core handlers were specified, particularly when handling crashes within namespaced environments. The core handler was configured to use `chroot` to enter the namespace of the crashing process before further analysis.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of chroot in conjunction with `execve()`",
        "File system race conditions",
        "Trusting of symlinks in /tmp",
        "Trusting of /proc/pid/exe symlink",
        "Trusting of attacker controlled root symlink"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an unprivileged user to gain root privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Exploitation via a specially crafted program, triggering a crash that invokes the vulnerable ABRT core handler.",
          "Race condition by unlinking and recreating the /var/tmp/abrt/<crash_report>/maps file to point to a file the attacker controls"
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to execute code. No special privileges are needed initially."
