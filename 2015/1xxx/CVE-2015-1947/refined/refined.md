Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-1947:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improperly built binaries in IBM DB2. Specifically, setuid or setgid binaries can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to gain root-level access. This is achieved by placing a malicious library in a location where a SETGID or SETUID binary would execute it.
*   **Insecure Binary Build:** The core issue is that the binaries are built in a way that allows for this type of exploitation via malicious library loading.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the affected system, as they obtain root privileges. This includes the ability to execute arbitrary code, read/write any data, and perform any administrative functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable DB2 instance is running. This could be a user with a regular account or an already compromised account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
*   **Ability to Create/Place Files:** They need to be able to create or place a malicious library in a location where the vulnerable DB2 binary will execute it.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **IBM InfoSphere BigInsights:** Versions 3.0, 3.0.0.1, 3.0.0.2, and 4.0 are affected.
*   **IBM DB2 LUW (Linux, Unix, Windows):** All fix pack levels of IBM DB2 V9.7, V10.1, and V10.5 running on AIX, Linux, HP-UX, and Solaris are affected. Windows is not vulnerable. This includes various editions of DB2 such as Express, Workgroup Server, Enterprise Server, Advanced Enterprise Server, Advanced Workgroup Server, and Connect editions.
*   **IBM DB2 pureScale Feature:** Version 9.8 running on AIX or Linux.

**Remediation:**
*   Apply the appropriate fix pack or special build provided by IBM.
