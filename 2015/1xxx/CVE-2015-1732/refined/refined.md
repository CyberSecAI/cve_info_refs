- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption that allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, or compromise existing websites and inject the exploit there. The attacker would need to convince users to visit these malicious pages, for example, through links in emails or instant messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage and convince the user to visit the page using Internet Explorer.
