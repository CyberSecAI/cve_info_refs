<http://spidercontrol.net/contact/?L=1>.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSET OWNERS WITH AFFECTED BAUMÜLLER PRODUCTS

Baumüller has reported that the three affected products will be retired in December 2015, and no patches are planned for these products. Baumüller recommends that asset owners contact them to discuss intermediate response options.

Baumüller’s contact information is available at the following URL: <http://www.baumuller.com/e_contacts_24h.htm>.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSET OWNERS WITH AFFECTED BECKHOFF PRODUCTS

Asset owners of an identified Beckhoff product should determine if a vulnerable version of eWebServer is in use. Asset owners using a vulnerable version of eWebServer should contact their supplier or IniNet Solutions GmbH to obtain a new version of eWebServer. Beckhoff has stated that IniNet Solutions GmbH products are not a Beckhoff product. eWebServer is an application software by a third-party vendor developed and sold independent of Beckhoff. Beckhoff asserts that their (standard) products are not affected.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Maintain layered physical and logical security to implement defense-in-depth design practices for ICS environments.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
