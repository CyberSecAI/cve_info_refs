| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=934795#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-15 19:44:38 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED CRD 2015-06-16  CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails  There is an vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails that can be used to bypass CSP protections and allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker domains.  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-1840.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       Applications which don't use jquery-ujs or jquery-rails. Fixed Versions:     jquery-rails versions 4.0.4 and 3.1.3 and jquery-ujs 1.0.4.  Impact ------ In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the href or action to " <https://attacker.com>" (note the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery, who will see this as a same origin request, and send the user's CSRF token to the attacker domain.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- To work around this problem, change code that allows users to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag to filter the user parameters.  For example, code like this:      link_to params  to code like this:      link_to filtered_params      def filtered_params       # Filter just the parameters that you trust     end  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 1-0-3-jquery_ujs_csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-ujs 1.0.3.  * 3-1-2-jquery-rails-csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-rails 3.1.2. * 4-0-3-jquery-rails-csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-rails 4.0.3.  Credits -------  Thanks to Ben Toews of GitHub for reporting the vulnerability to us, and working with us on a fix. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=934795#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-15 19:46:13 UTC  ``` CRD: 2015-06-16 ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=934795#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-06-15 22:00:49 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=934795#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-16 18:35:25 UTC  ``` public ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=934795#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2015-06-17 12:22:51 UTC  ``` rubygem-jquery-rails is in the cloud5 development project, but not on the DVD.

Subject: [CVE-2015-1840] CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails

CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails

There is an vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails that can be used to
bypass CSP protections and allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker domains.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-1840.

Versions Affected:  All.
Not affected:       Applications which don't use jquery-ujs or jquery-rails.
Fixed Versions:     jquery-rails versions 4.0.4 and 3.1.3 and jquery-ujs 1.0.4.

Impact
------
In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or
the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the
href or action to " <https://attacker.com>" (note the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery,
who will see this as a same origin request, and send the user's CSRF token to the attacker domain.

Releases
--------
The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
To work around this problem, change code that allows users to control the href attribute of an anchor
tag or the action attribute of a form tag to filter the user parameters.

For example, code like this:

    link_to params

to code like this:

    link_to filtered_params

    def filtered_params
      # Filter just the parameters that you trust
    end

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the
supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

* 1-0-3-jquery_ujs_csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-ujs 1.0.3.

* 3-1-2-jquery-rails-csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-rails 3.1.2.
* 4-0-3-jquery-rails-csrf.patch - Patch for jquery-rails 4.0.3.

Credits
-------

Thanks to Ben Toews of GitHub for reporting the vulnerability to us, and working with us on a fix.
