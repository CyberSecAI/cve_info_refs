Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how `jquery-ujs` and `jquery-rails` handle URLs within the `href` attribute of anchor tags or the `action` attribute of form tags.
- A leading space in the URL (e.g., " <https://attacker.com>") causes jQuery to treat the request as same-origin, even if it points to a different domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections.
- **Same-Origin Policy violation:** The leading space in the URL circumvents the Same-Origin Policy, enabling cross-domain requests with CSRF tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a user's browser into sending their CSRF token to an attacker-controlled domain.
- The attacker can then use this token to perform actions on the legitimate application on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the `href` attribute of an anchor tag or the `action` attribute of a form tag that triggers a POST request.
- This control could come from:
    - Stored XSS in the application which could insert the malicious links into the HTML.
    - Manipulating a link on a page under attacker control
    - A malicious user could craft these links themselves in controlled scenarios.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control the `href` or `action` attributes of links/forms within the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the application's server or backend.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of `jquery-ujs` and `jquery-rails` before the patched versions.
- Fixed versions: `jquery-rails` 4.0.4 and 3.1.3; `jquery-ujs` 1.0.4.
- Patches are provided for older versions, namely, `jquery-ujs` 1.0.3, `jquery-rails` 3.1.2, and `jquery-rails` 4.0.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ben Toews of GitHub.
