Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `serve-static` middleware for Node.js handles specially crafted URLs, specifically those containing `//` followed by an external domain and `/%2e%2e`. This input is misinterpreted, leading to an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The `serve-static` middleware, when configured to mount at the root, doesn't properly sanitize or handle URLs that include a double slash (`//`) followed by a domain name and path traversal sequences like `/%2e%2e`.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The software does not perform sufficient checks on the requested path before processing it, which allows for the path to be interpreted as an external URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Arbitrary Sites:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, redirects the user to an arbitrary external website controlled by the attacker.
*   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** This can be exploited for phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into visiting a malicious site that looks legitimate. Users could have sensitive information stolen.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to websites hosting malware or other malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is primarily through crafted URLs with the specific format `//external_domain/%2e%2e`.
*   **Web Browsers:**  The vulnerability can be triggered when a user accesses a specially crafted URL using a web browser (confirmed to work in Firefox, Safari, and likely IE, but not Chrome).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to know that the `serve-static` middleware is being used and is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to generate URLs with the described format `//external_domain/%2e%2e`.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to get the victim to visit the crafted URL. This could be done through phishing emails, malicious links on websites, etc.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in `serve-static` versions prior to 1.7.2.
* The issue was reported to affect various applications using the vulnerable middleware, including those listed on the Express.js website.
* The issue can be mitigated by upgrading to `serve-static` version 1.7.2 or higher, or by setting the `redirect` option to `false`.
* Red Hat has marked this Bugzilla entry as "community support informational purposes only", as it doesn't directly affect commercially supported Red Hat products but is present in the nodejs packages.
