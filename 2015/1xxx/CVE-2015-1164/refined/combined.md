## Description

[![@pierre-elie](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923751?u=f1149b809ecaac7bd6200763fdf5e826dcae24fd&v=4&size=48)](/pierre-elie)[pierre-elie](https://github.com/pierre-elie)opened [on Jan 3, 2015](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/issues/26#issue-53290123)

Stumbled upon a weird behavior where `serve-static` would redirect to an external website when "asked nicely".

## Reproduction Steps

Using `express 4.10.6` and `static-serve 1.7.1` on `node 0.10.33`.

#### 1. Simple `app.js`

```
var app = require('express')();
app.use(require('serve-static')('assets'));
app.listen(80);
```
#### 2. Start server

```
$ sudo node app.js
```
#### 3. Open in Firefox `http://localhost//www.google.com/%2e%2e`

##### Request

```
GET //www.google.com/%2e%2e HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
```
##### Response

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Location: //www.google.com/%2e%2e/
Date: Sat, 03 Jan 2015 01:13:49 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Redirecting to <a href="//www.google.com/%2e%2e/">//www.google.com/%2e%2e/</a>
```
#### 4. You get redirected to Google...

---

It works in Firefox, Safari and probably IE, not in Chrome.

Setting `static-serve`’s option `redirect: false` seems to fix it (but `redirect: true` is the default).

It looks like many applications could be affected.

A quick test on apps listed on <http://expressjs.com/resources/applications.html> does not disappoint:

* [https://myspace.com//www.google.com/%2e%2e](https://myspace.com//www.google.com/..)
* [https://www.learnboost.com//www.google.com/%2e%2e](https://www.learnboost.com//www.google.com/..)
* [https://geekli.st//www.google.com/%2e%2e](https://geekli.st//www.google.com/..)
* etc

[`send`](https://github.com/tj/send) emits `directory` in that case, which [triggers the redirection](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/blob/master/index.js#L75-90).
