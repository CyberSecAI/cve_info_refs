Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Apache Cordova on Android handles configuration variables. Specifically, if an application built with Cordova doesn't explicitly define values in its `config.xml` file, these variables could be set by data passed through Android Intents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Intent Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the Intent bundle to set arbitrary configuration variables, as they were not being properly sanitized or validated.
- **Implicit Configuration:** The reliance on implicit configurations via Intents created a vulnerability, as application behavior could be controlled by external sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unwanted Dialogs:** Exploitation could lead to unwanted dialog boxes appearing within the application.
- **Changes in Application Behavior:** Attackers could alter the application's intended behavior.
- **App Force-Closing:** In severe cases, the manipulated configurations could cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Android Intents:** The primary attack vector is through manipulated Android Intents. These are system-level messages used for communication between components and applications. By crafting a malicious intent, an attacker can target vulnerable Cordova applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send Intents:** The attacker must have the ability to send Android Intents to the target application, which could be achieved through:
    - **Malicious Applications:** A malicious application installed on the same device.
    - **System-Level Access:** If the attacker has some form of system-level access on the device, this would be easier.
    - **Specific Network Exploits:** In certain scenarios, network exploits could be crafted to trigger specific intents.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Seven She from Trend Micro Mobile Threat Research Team (TRT).
- The fix in Cordova Android versions 4.0.2 and 3.7.2 involved entirely removing the ability for configuration parameters to be set by Intents.
- Developers are advised to ensure that all required configurations are defined in `config.xml` to avoid relying on Intents.
- Third-party plugins that relied on Intent-based configuration values were also impacted and needed to be updated to use the preferences API.
