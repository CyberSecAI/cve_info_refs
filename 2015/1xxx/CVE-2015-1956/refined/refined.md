- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of authentication credentials, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by sending specific byte sequences.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by consuming all available disk resources.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends specific byte sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.
