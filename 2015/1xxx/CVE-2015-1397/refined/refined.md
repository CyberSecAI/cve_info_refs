Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Magento vulnerability described in the Checkpoint blog post, which is related to CVE-2015-1397, CVE-2015-1398, and CVE-2015-1399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a chain of multiple issues that, when combined, allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The core issues stem from flaws in Magento's dynamic controller loading mechanism and insufficient access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Controller Injection:** Magento's controller loading logic uses the `PATH_INFO` variable to determine the module, controller, and action to execute. By manipulating this variable, an attacker can inject admin-context modules into user-context requests, bypassing admin authentication checks. The system validates admin sessions only if a request contains the `/admin/` prefix, failing to detect controller injection.
2.  **Authentication Bypass via 'forwarded' Parameter:** Magento's authentication logic checks for an active user session, and if one doesn't exist, it redirects to the login page. However, this logic can be bypassed by adding a 'forwarded' parameter to the request, allowing unauthenticated access to admin controllers.
3.  **Unrestricted Template Filtering with 'blockDirective':** The `Cms_Wysiwyg` controller's `directive` action uses the `filter()` function, which can call methods on a block class based on a specified function name in the request. The `blockDirective()` method can be used to create a Magento-“block” class under the attacker's control, which leads to arbitrary method invocation with attacker controlled parameters, and arbitrary method execution without arguments.
4.  **SQL Injection:** The `Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid` class's `getCsvFile()` method allows filtering of data extracted from the database by adding conditions to the SQL query. A flaw in parsing these filters allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, due to lack of escaping in `prepareSqlCondition`. Because Magento uses PHP PDO, multiple queries can be executed in a single statement.
5. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) / Local File Inclusion (LFI) using phar:// wrapper**: The vulnerability is ultimately exploited by using a combination of an SQL Injection and a LFI/RFI, by uploading a malicious file through the SQL injection, which is then included through the LFI. The use of the `phar://` wrapper allowed bypassing checks, and also including a file even if a trailing slash is present in the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining control of the entire Magento store and its database, including sensitive data such as customer credit card information.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal financial data and other personal information.
*   **Administrative Access:** Gaining full control of the system with the ability to add new admin accounts.
* **Backdoor injection:** The attackers modified core files, and added new files, to have a persistent backdoor to the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploiting specially crafted HTTP requests to the Magento server, manipulating the `PATH_INFO` variable and including a `forwarded` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL queries through the filter parameters of the grid functionality.
*   **File Upload:** Uploading a malicious file using SQL injection that will later be included through a LFI using the `phar://` wrapper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Magento server.
*   **Understanding of Magento's Architecture:** The attacker needs a detailed understanding of Magento's request handling, module system, and controller loading mechanism.

**Additional Details**
The content from sucuri.net also confirms that this vulnerability, known as "Magento Shoplift" (SUPEE-5344), is being actively exploited in the wild. The following techniques are being used:
- Creation of fake admin users in the Magento database, usually with usernames like 'vpwq', 'defaultmanager', or 'siqi', using email `email@example.com`.
- Use of SQLi to insert a new admin user, who will be used to further control the compromised website.
- Installation of the "Magpleasure File System" module to gain access to the filesystem.
- Modification of core files, specifically /lib/Varien/Db/Adaptor/Pdo/Mysql.php, to bypass patching.
- Injection of malicious code in /js/index.php and /js/lib/ccard.js to capture user input data, including credit card details and send it to external servers.
- Deployment of a web shell, sometimes found in files like errors/report.php, for full system control.
- Creation of CSV exports, in the var/export folder, which contain customer and product data.
- Creation of files such as `/media/dhl/info.php`, `/media/dhl/.htaccess` and `/js/api.php`.
- Usage of different 4-character long usernames, and a specific hash/salt combination "f4c8e326312d5ddb79c04b408e55010a:rp" for admin user passwords.
