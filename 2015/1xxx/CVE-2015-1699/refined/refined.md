Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Windows Journal parses Journal files (.jnt). A specially crafted Journal file can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows for remote code execution.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The core issue is that Windows Journal doesn't properly validate or sanitize the contents of the .jnt file, leading to the possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who opens the malicious .jnt file.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data on the compromised system may be exposed, altered, or deleted.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware or other malicious tools on the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** Attackers send specially crafted .jnt files to users via email, tricking them into opening the malicious file.
- **Other Delivery Methods:** Other methods of delivering the malicious .jnt file are also possible including compromised websites or removable media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted .jnt file that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious .jnt file.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows, including Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Server 2012/R2, and Windows RT/8.1.
- The provided documents don't include specifics on the exact nature of the crafted file or the underlying bug within Windows Journal's parsing logic.
- The provided document notes that the vulnerability has a severity rating of critical.
- The provided content also includes workarounds which include, not opening jnt files from untrusted sources, unassociating .jnt files, and disabling Windows Journal.
