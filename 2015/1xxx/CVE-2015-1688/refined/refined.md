Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, which can allow script to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation within Internet Explorer. This allows for the possibility of elevating privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run script with elevated privileges within Internet Explorer.
- This elevation of privilege, combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g. remote code execution), can allow the attacker to run arbitrary code with the same permissions as the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also host malicious content.
- The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious site (e.g., through social engineering, malicious links).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website that an unsuspecting user would visit using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- The attacker must trick the user to take action such as clicking on a link to the malicious site.
- The attacker needs a separate exploit to execute code arbitrarily. The elevation of privilege vulnerability will help run this arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability is categorized as an "Elevation of Privilege" vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as "Important" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on various Windows client and server platforms.
- Internet Explorer 7 installed on Windows Server 2003 is not affected.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
