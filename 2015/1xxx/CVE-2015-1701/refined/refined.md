{
  "CVE-2015-1701": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Improper object handling in the win32k.sys kernel-mode driver.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The Win32k.sys kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability."

       "Root cause": "Win32k.sys kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper object handling in the win32k.sys driver"
       ],
      "Impact": "Elevation of privileges to kernel mode, allowing for arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "Local access via a specially crafted application"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability."
    },
   {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Win32k.sys kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper object handling"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for the execution of arbitrary code in kernel mode. This can lead to full system compromise, including the ability to install software, alter or remove data, and create new accounts with full user privileges.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access is required to exploit. Attackers must be able to log onto the system."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Attackers must have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to an affected system."
    },
   {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of objects in memory by the win32k.sys kernel-mode driver.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of objects in memory"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This can allow for complete control of an affected system, the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": [
       "Local access is required. The attacker must be able to log on to the system."
      ],
