- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of certain web requests by ASP.NET when custom error messages are disabled. This leads to the disclosure of file content details within error messages, including parts of web configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure vulnerability in ASP.NET.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view parts of a web configuration file, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends a specially crafted web request to an affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted web request to the server. The targeted server must have custom error messages disabled (i.e., `<customerrors mode="off">`). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
