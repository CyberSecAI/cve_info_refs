Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds memory access issue existed in the kernel due to a missing limit check in the fat loader. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when processing Mach-O fat binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability.
- Missing limit check when parsing fat headers in Mach-O files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can cause unexpected system termination.
- A local user may be able to read kernel memory.
- A malicious application may be able to cause unexpected system termination or read kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local user can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious Mach-O fat binary file with a large number of architectures declared. The attacker then attempts to execute this malicious binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit from exploit-db provides a C code that can generate a malicious Mach-O fat binary with 4096 architecture entries to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects OS X (multiple versions), iOS, and watchOS.
- The vulnerability was fixed with improved memory handling in the kernel.
