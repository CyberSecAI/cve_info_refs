- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Incorrect default exclude patterns introduced in Struts 2.3.20. The `excludeParams` setting was overridden, bypassing the `DefaultExcludedPatternsChecker`. This allowed the attacker to potentially manipulate internal application states through parameter injection.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Inadequate parameter exclusion: The `excludeParams` setting, meant to prevent specific parameters from being processed, was not correctly applied due to a flaw in how it interacts with the `DefaultExcludedPatternsChecker`.
    - Default settings vulnerability: The vulnerability exists when default settings are used.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can compromise internal application state.
- **Attack Vectors:** Parameter injection through HTTP requests.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with specific parameters that would normally be excluded. The attacker would need to know or discover which parameters are not being correctly excluded due to the vulnerability.
