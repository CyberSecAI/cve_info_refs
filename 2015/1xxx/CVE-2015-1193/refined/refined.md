Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1193:

**CVE-2015-1193**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pax` utility is vulnerable to directory traversal flaws when extracting files from an archive. This occurs due to the program not properly sanitizing file paths within an archive before extracting them, which allows extraction of files outside the current directory.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Path traversal using `..`:** The program does not prevent extraction of files with `..` path components in their names, allowing an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the file system that the user has write access to.
    *   **Full Path Traversal:** The program also allows extraction of files with absolute paths specified in the archive, enabling writing files to arbitrary locations in the filesystem.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious archive that, when extracted by a vulnerable version of `pax`, can overwrite or create arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Arbitrary file write:** Overwriting critical system files.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** By writing to configuration files or other privileged areas, attackers could escalate their privileges.
    *   **Denial of service:** Overwriting application files or configurations can disrupt the normal operation of programs.
    *   **Data manipulation:** Modifying application data.

*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor creates a crafted archive file containing file paths with `..` components or absolute paths. The user then uses a vulnerable version of `pax` to extract the files from this archive, triggering the vulnerability.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create a crafted archive file (e.g., tar)
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to extract the malicious archive using the vulnerable `pax` command.

The provided content also mentions **CVE-2015-1194**:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The `pax` utility is vulnerable to symlink following when extracting files from an archive. This occurs because the program extracts symlinks and then follows these symlinks when extracting further entries from the archive.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Symlink Following:** The program extracts symbolic links and then uses them to resolve further paths. This allows attackers to write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory, even if the target directory has specific access permissions that would otherwise prevent direct access.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** By crafting an archive with symlinks, an attacker can redirect file writes to locations not normally accessible during extraction of archive files.

*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor creates a crafted archive file containing symlinks. The user then uses a vulnerable version of `pax` to extract the files from this archive, triggering the symlink following vulnerability.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create a crafted archive file with symlinks
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to extract the malicious archive using the vulnerable `pax` command.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for CVE-2015-1193 doesn't automatically address CVE-2015-1194, as symlink following is considered a separate vulnerability type by MITRE.
*   The Debian bug report #774716 tracks both CVE-2015-1193 and CVE-2015-1194.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in `pax` version `1:20160306-1`
