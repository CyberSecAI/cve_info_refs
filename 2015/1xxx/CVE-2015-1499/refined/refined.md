- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the ActiveMQ Broker service that is installed as part of the Samsung Security Manager product. The service improperly handles HTTP DELETE requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The ActiveMQ Broker service is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to the lack of authentication and proper input validation when processing HTTP DELETE requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service by deleting critical system files rendering the server unusable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the vulnerable ActiveMQ Broker service via HTTP DELETE requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
