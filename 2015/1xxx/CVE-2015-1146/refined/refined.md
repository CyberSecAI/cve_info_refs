The provided document describes security updates for OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and Security Update 2015-004. It includes a section on code signing that mentions CVE-2015-1146.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Applications containing specially crafted bundles may have been able to launch without a completely valid signature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of code signatures allowed tampered applications to bypass security checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Tampered applications may launch without proper verification, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker could craft a malicious application bundle with a specially crafted signature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker would need the ability to create or modify application bundles on the target system.
