Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-1711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, potentially allowing them to install software, modify or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability.
- They would then need to convince a user to visit the malicious website. This could involve sending a link via email or instant messenger, or embedding the malicious code into a compromised site or ad.
- The attack is triggered when the user's Internet Explorer browser accesses the malicious content, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.
- They need to be able to trick the user into visiting the website via some form of social engineering.
- They need to create a specially crafted website with malicious content that can trigger the vulnerability in affected versions of Internet Explorer.
