Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `user_id` parameter used in the `zero_transact_user.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `user_id` parameter in `zero_transact_user.php` is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected SQL queries. Instead they must infer the results by observing the response time of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the application's database.
*   In the context of a blind SQL injection, attackers can extract sensitive information by using time-based techniques (e.g. the `SLEEP()` function in the provided example).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/views/zero_transact_user.php` endpoint.
*   The malicious SQL code is injected through the `user_id` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters, in this case, the `user_id` parameter.
*   The attack is executed against the administrative backend of Zerocms.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request with the malicious SQL payload within the user_id parameter.

**Additional Details**

* The vulnerability was found in Zerocms version <= 1.3.3.
* The provided exploit example uses a `SLEEP(30)` SQL command to demonstrate how the blind SQL injection can be exploited to confirm that the code is vulnerable.
