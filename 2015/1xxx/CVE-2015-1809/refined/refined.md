Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2015-1809:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Jenkins' improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE) during XPath processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject external entities into XML documents that Jenkins processes via XPath. This allows attackers to force the server to access external or local resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By injecting malicious XML, an attacker can force Jenkins to retrieve arbitrary XML documents from the server. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information that might be inside or outside the Jenkins environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious XML document that includes external entity references. This XML document is then processed by Jenkins through its XPath functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Read Access:** The attacker needs to have read access to the Jenkins instance to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is referred to as **SECURITY-165** within the Jenkins security advisory.
- It was discovered by Fabian Beterke.
- The vulnerability affects Jenkins versions 1.600 and earlier and LTS versions 1.580.3 and earlier.
- The fix is included in Jenkins 1.600 and 1.596.1.
