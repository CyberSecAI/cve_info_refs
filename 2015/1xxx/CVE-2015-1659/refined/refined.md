- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website or use compromised websites to deliver malicious content that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker would need to convince a user to view this content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or inject the exploit code into a website, and must convince a user to visit the site using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
