Based on the information provided, the following can be extracted regarding CVE-2015-1590:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `kamcmd` administrative utility and its default configuration used `/tmp/kamailio_ctl`, which is an insecure location for a FIFO file. This could allow local users to elevate privileges to the kamailio user.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Insecure default configuration using a predictable path in `/tmp` for a FIFO file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Local privilege escalation to the kamailio user.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the FIFO file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Fix:** The fix involved changing the default FIFO path from `/tmp/kamailio_fifo` to `/var/run/kamailio/kamailio_fifo`.
