    "description": "The bdfReadCharacters function in bitmap/bdfread.c in X.Org libXfont before 1.4.9 and 1.5.x before 1.5.1 does not properly handle character bitmaps it cannot read, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted BDF font file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The BDF parser in libXfont doesn't handle errors correctly when parsing the bitmap data for a character in a BDF font file, causing it to proceed with an invalid pointer.",

      "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this issue to crash the X.Org server.",
