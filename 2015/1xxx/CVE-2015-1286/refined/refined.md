{
  "CVE-2015-1286": {
    "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the V8ContextNativeHandler::GetModuleSystem function in extensions/renderer/v8_context_native_handler.cc in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by leveraging the lack of a certain V8 context restriction, aka a Blink \"Universal XSS (UXSS).\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient security checks within the `V8ContextNativeHandler::GetModuleSystem` function. It fails to properly validate the context's security token, enabling a cross-origin access.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically a Universal XSS (UXSS) due to the lack of context restrictions when using  `GetModuleSystem` function.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML into a webpage, potentially leading to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the exploitation of the insecure `GetModuleSystem` function in the extensions/renderer/v8_context_native_handler.cc file. This can be triggered via a crafted web page by a remote attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to a victim using a vulnerable version of Google Chrome.",
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability is located in the extensions/renderer/v8_context_native_handler.cc file, specifically the V8ContextNativeHandler::GetModuleSystem function.",
     "The issue is due to improper validation of V8 context security tokens.",
      "The fix involves implementing the security check from BindingSecurity to prevent cross-origin access."
