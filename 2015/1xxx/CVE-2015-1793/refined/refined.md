{
  "CVE-2015-1793": {
    "Description": "During certificate verification, OpenSSL will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first attempt to build such a chain fails, unless the application explicitly specifies X509_V_FLAG_NO_ALT_CHAINS. An error in the implementation of this logic could erroneously mark a certificate as trusted when they should not.",
    "Root cause": "An error in the implementation of the logic for finding an alternative certificate chain during certificate verification.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect certificate chain validation logic."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted certificates, such as the CA (certificate authority) flag, to be bypassed, which would enable them to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and issue an invalid certificate.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malformed certificate chains."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to provide a malformed certificate to a system that attempts to build and validate a certificate chain."
  }
