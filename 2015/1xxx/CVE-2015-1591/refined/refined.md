Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2015-1591 lies in the insecure use of the `/tmp` directory during the Kamailio build process. Specifically, the build process creates temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable names, allowing local users to potentially manipulate these files for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `kamctl` utility Makefile used hardcoded paths within the `/tmp` directory during the build process to store temporary files, instead of using a directory specific to the build process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this by creating or manipulating the temporary files used during the build process to gain elevated privileges, up to the build user's level.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is only exploitable by users with local access to the system where the Kamailio build process is being executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a local user account on the system where the Kamailio package is being built.
*   **Write access to /tmp**: An attacker needs to be able to create and write to files within the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the build process, not the running Kamailio service itself.
*   The fix involves modifying the build scripts to use more secure locations for temporary files (e.g., a directory relative to the build path).
*   The issue was reported as part of a larger set of `/tmp` related vulnerabilities in Kamailio which includes: CVE-2015-1590 and CVE-2013-7426.
