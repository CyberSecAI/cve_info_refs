- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the failure to set the secure flag for session cookies in SSL mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session cookies lack the secure attribute. This allows the cookies to be transmitted over unencrypted connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can capture the cookie by intercepting it within an HTTP session. This enables the attacker to obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position. The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the victim and the vulnerable server. The victim is tricked into navigating the site on an unencrypted connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a MitM position on the network and needs to trick the victim into navigating to the vulnerable site on an unencrypted connection.
