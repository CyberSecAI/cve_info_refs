Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-1785:

**Root Cause:**

*   The NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection on its file upload functionality. Specifically, it does not implement a unique token or nonce to prevent unauthorized HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF:** The absence of CSRF protection allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Unsafe File Upload:** When combined with an unsafe file upload vulnerability (CVE-2015-1784), this CSRF vulnerability can be exploited to upload malicious files (like webshells) to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including PHP webshells, to the server.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** By exploiting the uploaded webshell, an attacker can execute system commands, potentially leading to complete system compromise, access to databases, and defacement.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Lower-level users with upload access, such as editors or subscribers, can be used in a privilege escalation attack leading to webshell.
*   **Application Compromise:** The application becomes fully compromised through the ability to upload and execute malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link or XSS:** An attacker can trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or exploiting an XSS vulnerability. This would cause the user's browser to unknowingly send a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **CSRF Proof of Concept (PoC):** A crafted HTML page can be used to forge a request for the file upload, bypassing the need to directly interact with the upload form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target User Authentication:** The attacker must target an authenticated user to be successful. This could be an administrator or any user with the permission to upload files using the NextGEN plugin.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how HTTP requests work to craft a malicious request, including manipulating form-data and headers.
*   **External Hosting:** The malicious HTML page used for the CSRF attack needs to be hosted on a separate server or an externally accessible location.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker manipulates the "file" parameter in the POST request, appending ".php" to a file name (e.g., `shell.jpg.php`) to bypass server-side validation and inserting a valid JPEG header to trick the application's file analysis.
*   The content-type is set to “image/jpeg” to bypass the file validation.
*   The uploaded file can be accessed at `"/wp-content/gallery/[name of gallery]/[name of file]"`.

**Additional Notes:**

* The blog post specifies that there are around 12 million users vulnerable to CSRF with a webshell, 2.4 million vulnerable to webshell through unsafe file upload, and 100,000 vulnerable to unauthenticated unsafe file upload.
* The vulnerability was discovered on March 9th, 2015, and patched on March 12th, 2015 in version 2.0.77.3.
*  The vulnerability is present in NextGEN Gallery versions below 2.0.77.3
*   The content mentions a related vulnerability CVE-2015-1784, which is a file upload bypass vulnerability which is exploited by this CSRF.
