Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This improper implementation makes it easier for an attacker to predict memory offsets of specific instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the ASLR security mechanism. ASLR is designed to randomize memory addresses to make exploitation harder, so its failure allows for more reliable memory manipulation.
- **Security Feature Bypass:** This vulnerability is classified as a security feature bypass since it circumvents the intended protection of ASLR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **ASLR Bypass Enables Other Attacks:** By itself, this vulnerability does not allow for direct arbitrary code execution. However, it makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities like remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in combination with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.
- **Increased Reliability of Exploits:** Bypassing ASLR makes exploitation more reliable for attackers as they can more accurately predict memory addresses, which is necessary for certain types of attacks like RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-browsing Scenario:** The primary attack vector is a user visiting a specially crafted website while using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host malicious content:** Attackers need to be able to host or inject specially crafted web content that triggers the ASLR bypass vulnerability.
- **User interaction:**  The attack requires a user to visit the malicious website with an affected version of Internet Explorer, which needs user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content clarifies that this vulnerability is classified as "Important" for client systems and "Low" for server systems.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.
- The vulnerability itself does not permit arbitrary code execution, instead, it enables other potential exploits that leverage a bypass of ASLR.
