# Hostname verification should be required by default when OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY\_PEER is configured #8

## Description

[![@tarcieri](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/797?u=aca2ca512c04d8fb56e791ffd737ceb54be75ad3&v=4&size=48)](/tarcieri)[tarcieri](https://github.com/tarcieri)opened [on Mar 24, 2015](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/8#issue-64115523)

Even if OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY\_PEER is configured, I/O is allowed with a remote server before the subject has been verified. VERIFY\_PEER only checks the cert chain is rooted in the local truststore. It does not check if the subject is valid in and of itself.

My understanding is the `ssl_socket.post_connection_check(hostname)` method *must* be called to ensure the subject is correctly verified. However, communication is allowed to remote services without verifying the subject.

I would suggest throwing an exception if VERIFY\_PEER is configured and I/O is attempted without first calling `post_connection_check`

It would also be nice if this all happened automatically simply by passing `hostname` into OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket (which AFAICT only affects SNI presently, and not subject verification)
