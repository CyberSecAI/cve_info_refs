# Introduction

## Problem description:

On Ubuntu Vivid Linux distribution *apport*
is used for automated sending of client program crash dumps but
also of kernel crash dumps. For kernel crashes, upstart or SysV
init invokes the program */usr/share/apport/kernel\_crashdump*
at boot to prepare crash dump files for sending. This action is
performed with root privileges. As the crash dump directory
*/var/crash/* is world writable and *kernel\_crashdump*
performs file access in unsafe manner, any local user may trigger
a denial of service or escalate to root privileges. If symlink
and hardlink protection is enabled (which should be the default
for any modern system), only denial of service is possible.

Problematic syscall in *kernel\_crashdump* is:

open("/var/crash/linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic.0.crash", O\_WRONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_TRUNC|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 30
...
open("/var/crash/vmcore.log", O\_RDONLY|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC) = 31

Thus the output file is opened unconditionally and without
*O\_EXCL* or *O\_NOFOLLOW*. Also opening of input file
does not care about links.

# Methods

## Denial of service:

It is trivial to make the input and output
file the same by just placing a hardlink. This is allowed even
with hardlink protection enabled as the unprivileged user doing
that will have write permissions for the rogue file and the new
hardlink pointing to it. On reboot *kernel\_crashdump* will
include its own output over and over again in the crashdump till
the disk is completely filled. This can be done using
<PrepareDoSBoot.py>.

## Privilege escalation:

With symlink or hardlink protection turned
of, <PrepareMagicBoot.py> can
be used to escalate privileges. While the link attack is really
trivial (see code), the method to gain full code control is quite
nice: The problem is, that *kernel\_crashdump* creates following
report format:

ProblemType: KernelCrash
Architecture: i386
Date: Fri Sep 4 20:36:21 2015
DistroRelease: Ubuntu 15.04
Package: linux-image-3.19.0-26-generic 3.19.0-26.28
Uname: Linux 3.19.0-26-generic i686
VmCore: base64
H4sICAAAAAAC/1ZtQ29yZQA=
AwA=
VmCoreLog: base64
H4sICAAAAAAC/1ZtQ29yZUxvZwA=
AwA=

The structure contains some predefined fields and compressed
base64 encoded log data and core. Overwriting */etc/shadow*
(line structure violated) or */etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf*
(requires absolute path) with that content would just cause DoS,
so not so interesting. Overwriting executables does not help neither
as no valid execution file header can be produced. But there are
scripts, e.g. */etc/rc.local*, that execute text without
any need for a header in their context, .e.g */lib/init/vars.sh*.
Overwriting those would also just result in errors, because none
of the included attribute names is user controllabe to make it
refer to a path the unprivileged local user could control. So
the last chance is to make the base64 encoded, compressed log
or core file data to point to a suitable location.

Generation of such data is not as simple as it seems. To avoid
having additional requirements on available directories on that
machine, only existance of */var/crash* should be needed,
no attempts should be made to construct data for */home*
or */var/www/...*. As */etc/rc.local* is executed with
current working directory at */*, also relative path would
be sufficient.

Due to *deflate compression* method used before encoding,
there are only some combinations of lower bits in the first byte
allowed. See section *details of block format* in
[RFC1951](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt).
As a consequence, it is not possible to create compressed data
that would start with *var/crash* (last chunk in dynamic
encoding, but literal/distance/code length codes do not form
a valid combination), */var/crash* (non-last chunk in reserved
encoding) of *//var/crash* (last chunk in reserved encoding).
Hence no compressed data block will start with suitable values,
but code analysis reveals another chance:

*kernel\_crashdump* will split long dumps into blocks
of 1MB size, comress them and write the base64 encoded output
to separate lines. This is especially interesting as deflate
operates on bit basis, compression output is in bytes. Hence
when one block is compressed, some bits remain in the output
buffer and are combined with bits from the next block. Thus it
might be possible to find two adjacent blocks where the bits
at this position may form the desired sequence of bytes.

As detail analysis of the deflate algorithm to carefully craft
a suitable first block was too much effort, a program to guess
appropriate blocks was used (<CreateVmcore.py>).
Invoking it to target *var/crash* sequence and alike did
not yield any results.

Also strings with additional slashes prepeneded or within path
could not be created. Luckily, one alternative path was found,
that should exist on all systems and can be the output of the
compression and encoding transformation: *proc//1/root/var/crash/*.

$ ./CreateVmcore.py proc//1/root/var/crash/A
...
58045-Tail ec-7Nb5XxsEvuh9 (45983) last 880 b6366ec99f8f (tjZuyZ+PHP65)
Good result: proc//1/root/var/crash/AkrxiSugWCRV9CZ0GL...8TAQ==

Just replacing some bytes with 0 and modifying the tail to
be shorter not to exceed the maximum path length. For exploitation
following steps were performed:

* Copy /lib/init/vars.sh to /var/crash
* Prepare vmcore and symlink to overwrite /lib/init/vars.sh
  with crash dump report
* Wait for reboot and invocation of /etc/rc.local
* Restore /lib/init/vars.sh to be back to normal

<PrepareMagicBoot.py> performs
all the steps to prepare the system for reboot. It also includes
the vmcore data to be compressed by the *kernel\_crashdump*.

$ ./PrepareMagicBoot.py
nobody@localhost:/var/crash$ ls -al

# Results, Discussion

Not a big issue, as symlink protection should be standard nowadays.
But the crafting of the core file was fun, so let others enjoy also.

Abstract
This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that
compresses data using a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman
coding, with efficiency comparable to the best currently available
general-purpose compression methods. The data can be produced or
consumed, even for an arbitrarily long sequentially presented input
data stream, using only an a priori bounded amount of intermediate
storage. The format can be implemented readily in a manner not
covered by patents.

1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this specification is to define a lossless
compressed data format that:
\* Is independent of CPU type, operating system, file system,
and character set, and hence can be used for interchange;
\* Can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long
sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a
priori bounded amount of intermediate storage, and hence
can be used in data communications or similar structures
such as Unix filters;
\* Compresses data with efficiency comparable to the best
currently available general-purpose compression methods,
and in particular considerably better than the "compress"
program;
\* Can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by
patents, and hence can be practiced freely;
Deutsch Informational [Page 2]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
\* Is compatible with the file format produced by the current
widely used gzip utility, in that conforming decompressors
will be able to read data produced by the existing gzip
compressor.
The data format defined by this specification does not attempt to:
\* Allow random access to compressed data;
\* Compress specialized data (e.g., raster graphics) as well
as the best currently available specialized algorithms.
A simple counting argument shows that no lossless compression
algorithm can compress every possible input data set. For the
format defined here, the worst case expansion is 5 bytes per 32K-
byte block, i.e., a size increase of 0.015% for large data sets.
English text usually compresses by a factor of 2.5 to 3;
executable files usually compress somewhat less; graphical data
such as raster images may compress much more.
1.2. Intended audience
This specification is intended for use by implementors of software
to compress data into "deflate" format and/or decompress data from
"deflate" format.
The text of the specification assumes a basic background in
programming at the level of bits and other primitive data
representations. Familiarity with the technique of Huffman coding
is helpful but not required.
1.3. Scope
The specification specifies a method for representing a sequence
of bytes as a (usually shorter) sequence of bits, and a method for
packing the latter bit sequence into bytes.
1.4. Compliance
Unless otherwise indicated below, a compliant decompressor must be
able to accept and decompress any data set that conforms to all
the specifications presented here; a compliant compressor must
produce data sets that conform to all the specifications presented
here.
1.5. Definitions of terms and conventions used
Byte: 8 bits stored or transmitted as a unit (same as an octet).
For this specification, a byte is exactly 8 bits, even on machines
Deutsch Informational [Page 3]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
which store a character on a number of bits different from eight.
See below, for the numbering of bits within a byte.
String: a sequence of arbitrary bytes.
1.6. Changes from previous versions
There have been no technical changes to the deflate format since
version 1.1 of this specification. In version 1.2, some
terminology was changed. Version 1.3 is a conversion of the
specification to RFC style.
2. Compressed representation overview
A compressed data set consists of a series of blocks, corresponding
to successive blocks of input data. The block sizes are arbitrary,
except that non-compressible blocks are limited to 65,535 bytes.
Each block is compressed using a combination of the LZ77 algorithm
and Huffman coding. The Huffman trees for each block are independent
of those for previous or subsequent blocks; the LZ77 algorithm may
use a reference to a duplicated string occurring in a previous block,
up to 32K input bytes before.
Each block consists of two parts: a pair of Huffman code trees that
describe the representation of the compressed data part, and a
compressed data part. (The Huffman trees themselves are compressed
using Huffman encoding.) The compressed data consists of a series of
elements of two types: literal bytes (of strings that have not been
detected as duplicated within the previous 32K input bytes), and
pointers to duplicated strings, where a pointer is represented as a
pair . The representation used in the
"deflate" format limits distances to 32K bytes and lengths to 258
bytes, but does not limit the size of a block, except for
uncompressible blocks, which are limited as noted above.
Each type of value (literals, distances, and lengths) in the
compressed data is represented using a Huffman code, using one code
tree for literals and lengths and a separate code tree for distances.
The code trees for each block appear in a compact form just before
the compressed data for that block.

3. Detailed specification
3.1. Overall conventions In the diagrams below, a box like this:
+---+
| | <-- the vertical bars might be missing
+---+
represents one byte; a box like this:
+==============+
| |
+==============+
represents a variable number of bytes.
Bytes stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since
they are always treated as a unit. However, a byte considered as
an integer between 0 and 255 does have a most- and least-
significant bit, and since we write numbers with the most-
significant digit on the left, we also write bytes with the most-
significant bit on the left. In the diagrams below, we number the
bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit, i.e.,
the bits are numbered:
+--------+
|76543210|
+--------+
Within a computer, a number may occupy multiple bytes. All
multi-byte numbers in the format described here are stored with
the least-significant byte first (at the lower memory address).
For example, the decimal number 520 is stored as:
0 1
+--------+--------+
|00001000|00000010|
+--------+--------+
^ ^
| |
| + more significant byte = 2 x 256
+ less significant byte = 8
3.1.1. Packing into bytes
This document does not address the issue of the order in which
bits of a byte are transmitted on a bit-sequential medium,
since the final data format described here is byte- rather than
Deutsch Informational [Page 5]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
bit-oriented. However, we describe the compressed block format
in below, as a sequence of data elements of various bit
lengths, not a sequence of bytes. We must therefore specify
how to pack these data elements into bytes to form the final
compressed byte sequence:
\* Data elements are packed into bytes in order of
increasing bit number within the byte, i.e., starting
with the least-significant bit of the byte.
\* Data elements other than Huffman codes are packed
starting with the least-significant bit of the data
element.
\* Huffman codes are packed starting with the most-
significant bit of the code.
In other words, if one were to print out the compressed data as
a sequence of bytes, starting with the first byte at the
\*right\* margin and proceeding to the \*left\*, with the most-
significant bit of each byte on the left as usual, one would be
able to parse the result from right to left, with fixed-width
elements in the correct MSB-to-LSB order and Huffman codes in
bit-reversed order (i.e., with the first bit of the code in the
relative LSB position).
3.2. Compressed block format
3.2.1. Synopsis of prefix and Huffman coding
Prefix coding represents symbols from an a priori known
alphabet by bit sequences (codes), one code for each symbol, in
a manner such that different symbols may be represented by bit
sequences of different lengths, but a parser can always parse
an encoded string unambiguously symbol-by-symbol.
We define a prefix code in terms of a binary tree in which the
two edges descending from each non-leaf node are labeled 0 and
1 and in which the leaf nodes correspond one-for-one with (are
labeled with) the symbols of the alphabet; then the code for a
symbol is the sequence of 0's and 1's on the edges leading from
the root to the leaf labeled with that symbol. For example:
Deutsch Informational [Page 6]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
/\ Symbol Code
0 1 ------ ----
/ \ A 00
/\ B B 1
0 1 C 011
/ \ D 010
A /\
0 1
/ \
D C
A parser can decode the next symbol from an encoded input
stream by walking down the tree from the root, at each step
choosing the edge corresponding to the next input bit.
Given an alphabet with known symbol frequencies, the Huffman
algorithm allows the construction of an optimal prefix code
(one which represents strings with those symbol frequencies
using the fewest bits of any possible prefix codes for that
alphabet). Such a code is called a Huffman code. (See
reference [1] in Chapter 5, references for additional
information on Huffman codes.)
Note that in the "deflate" format, the Huffman codes for the
various alphabets must not exceed certain maximum code lengths.
This constraint complicates the algorithm for computing code
lengths from symbol frequencies. Again, see Chapter 5,
references for details.
3.2.2. Use of Huffman coding in the "deflate" format
The Huffman codes used for each alphabet in the "deflate"
format have two additional rules:
\* All codes of a given bit length have lexicographically
consecutive values, in the same order as the symbols
they represent;
\* Shorter codes lexicographically precede longer codes.
Deutsch Informational [Page 7]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
We could recode the example above to follow this rule as
follows, assuming that the order of the alphabet is ABCD:
Symbol Code
------ ----
A 10
B 0
C 110
D 111
I.e., 0 precedes 10 which precedes 11x, and 110 and 111 are
lexicographically consecutive.
Given this rule, we can define the Huffman code for an alphabet
just by giving the bit lengths of the codes for each symbol of
the alphabet in order; this is sufficient to determine the
actual codes. In our example, the code is completely defined
by the sequence of bit lengths (2, 1, 3, 3). The following
algorithm generates the codes as integers, intended to be read
from most- to least-significant bit. The code lengths are
initially in tree[I].Len; the codes are produced in
tree[I].Code.
1) Count the number of codes for each code length. Let
bl\_count[N] be the number of codes of length N, N >= 1.
2) Find the numerical value of the smallest code for each
code length:
code = 0;
bl\_count[0] = 0;
for (bits = 1; bits <= MAX\_BITS; bits++) {
code = (code + bl\_count[bits-1]) << 1;
next\_code[bits] = code;
}
3) Assign numerical values to all codes, using consecutive
values for all codes of the same length with the base
values determined at step 2. Codes that are never used
(which have a bit length of zero) must not be assigned a
value.
for (n = 0; n <= max\_code; n++) {
len = tree[n].Len;
if (len != 0) {
tree[n].Code = next\_code[len];
next\_code[len]++;
}
Deutsch Informational [Page 8]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
}
Example:
Consider the alphabet ABCDEFGH, with bit lengths (3, 3, 3, 3,
3, 2, 4, 4). After step 1, we have:
N bl\_count[N]
- -----------
2 1
3 5
4 2
Step 2 computes the following next\_code values:
N next\_code[N]
- ------------
1 0
2 0
3 2
4 14
Step 3 produces the following code values:
Symbol Length Code
------ ------ ----
A 3 010
B 3 011
C 3 100
D 3 101
E 3 110
F 2 00
G 4 1110
H 4 1111
3.2.3. Details of block format
Each block of compressed data begins with 3 header bits
containing the following data:
first bit BFINAL
next 2 bits BTYPE
Note that the header bits do not necessarily begin on a byte
boundary, since a block does not necessarily occupy an integral
number of bytes.
Deutsch Informational [Page 9]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
BFINAL is set if and only if this is the last block of the data
set.
BTYPE specifies how the data are compressed, as follows:
00 - no compression
01 - compressed with fixed Huffman codes
10 - compressed with dynamic Huffman codes
11 - reserved (error)
The only difference between the two compressed cases is how the
Huffman codes for the literal/length and distance alphabets are
defined.
In all cases, the decoding algorithm for the actual data is as
follows:
do
read block header from input stream.
if stored with no compression
skip any remaining bits in current partially
processed byte
read LEN and NLEN (see next section)
copy LEN bytes of data to output
otherwise
if compressed with dynamic Huffman codes
read representation of code trees (see
subsection below)
loop (until end of block code recognized)
decode literal/length value from input stream
if value < 256
copy value (literal byte) to output stream
otherwise
if value = end of block (256)
break from loop
otherwise (value = 257..285)
decode distance from input stream
move backwards distance bytes in the output
stream, and copy length bytes from this
position to the output stream.
end loop
while not last block
Note that a duplicated string reference may refer to a string
in a previous block; i.e., the backward distance may cross one
or more block boundaries. However a distance cannot refer past
the beginning of the output stream. (An application using a
Deutsch Informational [Page 10]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
preset dictionary might discard part of the output stream; a
distance can refer to that part of the output stream anyway)
Note also that the referenced string may overlap the current
position; for example, if the last 2 bytes decoded have values
X and Y, a string reference with
adds X,Y,X,Y,X to the output stream.
We now specify each compression method in turn.
3.2.4. Non-compressed blocks (BTYPE=00)
Any bits of input up to the next byte boundary are ignored.
The rest of the block consists of the following information:
0 1 2 3 4...
+---+---+---+---+================================+
| LEN | NLEN |... LEN bytes of literal data...|
+---+---+---+---+================================+
LEN is the number of data bytes in the block. NLEN is the
one's complement of LEN.
3.2.5. Compressed blocks (length and distance codes)
As noted above, encoded data blocks in the "deflate" format
consist of sequences of symbols drawn from three conceptually
distinct alphabets: either literal bytes, from the alphabet of
byte values (0..255), or  pairs,
where the length is drawn from (3..258) and the distance is
drawn from (1..32,768). In fact, the literal and length
alphabets are merged into a single alphabet (0..285), where
values 0..255 represent literal bytes, the value 256 indicates
end-of-block, and values 257..285 represent length codes
(possibly in conjunction with extra bits following the symbol
code) as follows:
Deutsch Informational [Page 11]

stored with the most-significant bit first, e.g., bits 1110
represent the value 14.

3.2.6. Compression with fixed Huffman codes (BTYPE=01)
The Huffman codes for the two alphabets are fixed, and are not
represented explicitly in the data. The Huffman code lengths
for the literal/length alphabet are:

Deutsch Informational [Page 12]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
The code lengths are sufficient to generate the actual codes,
as described above; we show the codes in the table for added
clarity. Literal/length values 286-287 will never actually
occur in the compressed data, but participate in the code
construction.
Distance codes 0-31 are represented by (fixed-length) 5-bit
codes, with possible additional bits as shown in the table
shown in Paragraph 3.2.5, above. Note that distance codes 30-
31 will never actually occur in the compressed data.
3.2.7. Compression with dynamic Huffman codes (BTYPE=10)
The Huffman codes for the two alphabets appear in the block
immediately after the header bits and before the actual
compressed data, first the literal/length code and then the
distance code. Each code is defined by a sequence of code
lengths, as discussed in Paragraph 3.2.2, above. For even
greater compactness, the code length sequences themselves are
compressed using a Huffman code. The alphabet for code lengths
is as follows:
0 - 15: Represent code lengths of 0 - 15
16: Copy the previous code length 3 - 6 times.
The next 2 bits indicate repeat length
(0 = 3, ... , 3 = 6)
Example: Codes 8, 16 (+2 bits 11),
16 (+2 bits 10) will expand to
12 code lengths of 8 (1 + 6 + 5)
17: Repeat a code length of 0 for 3 - 10 times.
(3 bits of length)
18: Repeat a code length of 0 for 11 - 138 times
(7 bits of length)
A code length of 0 indicates that the corresponding symbol in
the literal/length or distance alphabet will not occur in the
block, and should not participate in the Huffman code
construction algorithm given earlier. If only one distance
code is used, it is encoded using one bit, not zero bits; in
this case there is a single code length of one, with one unused
code. One distance code of zero bits means that there are no
distance codes used at all (the data is all literals).
We can now define the format of the block:
5 Bits: HLIT, # of Literal/Length codes - 257 (257 - 286)
5 Bits: HDIST, # of Distance codes - 1 (1 - 32)
4 Bits: HCLEN, # of Code Length codes - 4 (4 - 19)
Deutsch Informational [Page 13]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
(HCLEN + 4) x 3 bits: code lengths for the code length
alphabet given just above, in the order: 16, 17, 18,
0, 8, 7, 9, 6, 10, 5, 11, 4, 12, 3, 13, 2, 14, 1, 15
These code lengths are interpreted as 3-bit integers
(0-7); as above, a code length of 0 means the
corresponding symbol (literal/length or distance code
length) is not used.
HLIT + 257 code lengths for the literal/length alphabet,
encoded using the code length Huffman code
HDIST + 1 code lengths for the distance alphabet,
encoded using the code length Huffman code
The actual compressed data of the block,
encoded using the literal/length and distance Huffman
codes
The literal/length symbol 256 (end of data),
encoded using the literal/length Huffman code
The code length repeat codes can cross from HLIT + 257 to the
HDIST + 1 code lengths. In other words, all code lengths form
a single sequence of HLIT + HDIST + 258 values.
3.3. Compliance
A compressor may limit further the ranges of values specified in
the previous section and still be compliant; for example, it may
limit the range of backward pointers to some value smaller than
32K. Similarly, a compressor may limit the size of blocks so that
a compressible block fits in memory.
A compliant decompressor must accept the full range of possible
values defined in the previous section, and must accept blocks of
arbitrary size.
4. Compression algorithm details
While it is the intent of this document to define the "deflate"
compressed data format without reference to any particular
compression algorithm, the format is related to the compressed
formats produced by LZ77 (Lempel-Ziv 1977, see reference [2] below);
since many variations of LZ77 are patented, it is strongly
recommended that the implementor of a compressor follow the general
algorithm presented here, which is known not to be patented per se.
The material in this section is not part of the definition of the
Deutsch Informational [Page 14]

RFC 1951 DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification May 1996
specification per se, and a compressor need not follow it in order to
be compliant.
The compressor terminates a block when it determines that starting a
new block with fresh trees would be useful, or when the block size
fills up the compressor's block buffer.
The compressor uses a chained hash table to find duplicated strings,
using a hash function that operates on 3-byte sequences. At any
given point during compression, let XYZ be the next 3 input bytes to
be examined (not necessarily all different, of course). First, the
compressor examines the hash chain for XYZ. If the chain is empty,
the compressor simply writes out X as a literal byte and advances one
byte in the input. If the hash chain is not empty, indicating that
the sequence XYZ (or, if we are unlucky, some other 3 bytes with the
same hash function value) has occurred recently, the compressor
compares all strings on the XYZ hash chain with the actual input data
sequence starting at the current point, and selects the longest
match.
The compressor searches the hash chains starting with the most recent
strings, to favor small distances and thus take advantage of the
Huffman encoding. The hash chains are singly linked. There are no
deletions from the hash chains; the algorithm simply discards matches
that are too old. To avoid a worst-case situation, very long hash
chains are arbitrarily truncated at a certain length, determined by a
run-time parameter.
To improve overall compression, the compressor optionally defers the
selection of matches ("lazy matching"): after a match of length N has
been found, the compressor searches for a longer match starting at
the next input byte. If it finds a longer match, it truncates the
previous match to a length of one (thus producing a single literal
byte) and then emits the longer match. Otherwise, it emits the
original match, and, as described above, advances N bytes before
continuing.
Run-time parameters also control this "lazy match" procedure. If
compression ratio is most important, the compressor attempts a
complete second search regardless of the length of the first match.
In the normal case, if the current match is "long enough", the
compressor reduces the search for a longer match, thus speeding up
the process. If speed is most important, the compressor inserts new
strings in the hash table only when no match was found, or when the
match is not "too long". This degrades the compression ratio but
saves time since there are both fewer insertions and fewer searches.

6. Security Considerations
Any data compression method involves the reduction of redundancy in
the data. Consequently, any corruption of the data is likely to have
severe effects and be difficult to correct. Uncompressed text, on
the other hand, will probably still be readable despite the presence
of some corrupted bytes.
It is recommended that systems using this data format provide some
means of validating the integrity of the compressed data. See
reference [3], for example.

### Bug Description

On Ubuntu Vivid Linux distribution upstart or SysV init invokes the program /usr/share/apport/kernel\_crashdump at boot to prepare crash dump files for sending. This action is performed with root privileges. As the crash dump directory /var/crash/ is world writable and kernel\_crashdump performs file access in unsafe manner, any local user may trigger a denial of service or escalate to root privileges. If symlink and hardlink protection is enabled (which should be the default for any modern system), only denial of service is possible.

Problematic syscall in kernel\_crashdump is:

open("/var/crash/linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic.0.crash", O\_WRONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_TRUNC|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 30

...

open("/var/crash/vmcore.log", O\_RDONLY|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC) = 31

Thus the output file is opened unconditionally and without O\_EXCL or O\_NOFOLLOW. Also opening of input file does not care about links.

By sym- or hardlinking from the predictable dump file name to the vmcore.log, kernel\_crashdump will recursively include its own dump as logfile, thus filling the disk. This also works with symlink and hardlink protection turned on.

By symlinking to other files (with symlink protection off), arbitrary files can be overwritten to gain root privileges.

Thanks halfdog for discovering this! The missing O\_EXCL when creating the .crash file is a real issue indeed. The "fill the disk" aspect seems less of an issue as normal users can fill up /var/crash/ anyway (of course on ext one usually has some 5% space reserved for root only), but checking for the file to not be a symlink is trivial either way.

Wrt. the "symlink.crash" aspect, several hooks are affected by this. Only some (apportcheckresume and apport itself) already open the file with O\_EXCL. Hooks usually use fileutils.make\_report\_path(), so I propose to change that to fileutils.make\_report\_file(), and let that open the file exclusively.

Wrt. the "symlink log" aspect, I checked the other hooks with grep -r '\[.\*= (' and they seem okay. E. g. gcc\_ice\_hook is run as normal user, and apport itself already uses an fd. package\_hook attaches log files that way, but they are specified by package-shipped hooks and are thus not user controllable.

This is my proposed patch against trunk for preventing the "recursively include itself" log file issue. Note that subprocess.DEVNULL (in the test case) doesn't exist yet in Python 2, thus this will need some minor changes on backporting. I'll attach debdiffs for Ubuntu stable packages that will include both fixes, but for trunk I'd like to commit the issues separately.

Also, do you want/need a CRD for this? This should at least get a CVE; Marc, can you please assign one?

I'll backport the patches to stables once this gets a round of review and CVE/CRD.

The first patch will solve the issue only when the new crashdump is not only with e.g. O\_CREAT|O\_EXCL|O\_NOFOLLOW, and then it would not be needed any more.

With current patch, a hardlink to the crash dump would still allow DOS. If crashdump open will a) fail when dump file already exists (like above) or b) unlinks it before recreating, then self-inclusion will not be possible for both sym- and hardlinks.

This would make also sense in another way: the os.walk below is in that combination far more dangerous than the plain open:

It has the same vulnerabilities as before, but as crashdump is following into subdirectories, O\_NOFOLLOW is ineffective for TOCTOU kind of attacks, see [1].

Apart from that, the loop misses joining in the root element into the path, so os.walk will essentially walk some objects, but the open calls afterwards will just open something completely different.

With correct crashdump opening, even the misbehaving os.walk would have no effect on DOS (except producing more sym/hardlink issues).

Still working on validating second patch.

There are some parts missing here, but I think I understand what you

mean. With the second patch, the .crash file is now opened with

O\_EXCL. However, that does not do anything to prevent self-inclusion:

If you create a

/var/crash/vmcore.log -> linux\_1234.crash

then even with O\_EXCL the creation of /var/crash/linux\_1234.crash will

succeed. It will just try to slurp in the contents of itself. This is

now prevented with the os.O\_NOFOLLOW.

I believe that's indentional. We don't want to put the .crash files

into the per-timestamp subdirs, but right into /var/crash/.

I'll post an updated second patch shortly.

There are some parts missing here, but I think I understand what you
mean. With the second patch, the .crash file is now opened with
O\_EXCL. However, that does not do anything to prevent self-inclusion:
If you create a
/var/crash/vmcore.log -> linux\_1234.crash
then even with O\_EXCL the creation of /var/crash/linux\_1234.crash will
succeed. It will just try to slurp in the contents of itself. This is
now prevented with the os.O\_NOFOLLOW.
I don't see how a hardlink would work: You'd have to pre-create a file
/var/crash/linux\_1234.crash in order to hardlink to it, and then
kernel\_crashdump would fail to open it due to the O\_EXCL in the second
patch.

@O\_EXCL: Oh, my mistake. Of course it will work for hardlinks also.

@os.walk: To put it in /var/crash directly is ok (design decision). But if I'm not wrong, current reading implementation will e.g. walk into

/var/crash/xxxx/012345678901

but then will try to open

/var/crash/012345678901/dmesg ...

which is a file not wher os.walk has walked before. I'm not sure, if this might not be used in some unwanted fashion.

Apart from that: going into a subdirectory will defeat the O\_NOFOLLOW as this is only applied to the last component (dmesg...) but not the "directory" the file is in. But also here: os symlink protection will still work over that and you need to make os.walk timerace (so you need an attacker controlled unprivileged process while kernel\_crashdump is running)

@halfdog: Indeed, the os.walk() looks pretty broken. It can potentially find stuff in subdirs of /var/crash/<timestamp>, and completely discards os.walk's "root" return value. It also uses "vmcore\_root" which is just an alias for apport.fileutils.report\_dir, which is confusing for reading the code.

@Louis: I subscribed you as he authored the kernel\_crashdump tool for kdump-tools. This is still an undisclosed bug, please don't mention any of this outside of this bug report until this gets public.

I was wondering how kdump-tools works in the first place: It seems that there is no /var/crash/vmcore or /var/crash/<timestamp>/vmcore at all, even though the comment says "kdump-tools has moved vmcore to timestamped dir"? Both the test case and kernel\_crashdump only handle picking up the "dmesg" file from /var/crash/<timestamp>/, but no .log file nor actual vmcore file? Is this missing from kernel\_crashdump and the test, or intended and the commentary is just wrong? This isn't clear from [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool) .

Can you please do an "ls -lR /var/crash" after a typical crash that is handled by kdump-tools, and show the result here?

This is the revised patch against trunk for preventing the "recursively include itself" log file issue. This now covers the "kdump-tools" case as well. This assumes that it's intended to only ever include that dmesg.\* file there, and \*not\* an actual "vmcore" file. Louis, please confirm.

Hi Martin, halfdog,

Just to be precise, I didn't author kernel\_crashdump, just adapted it to the use of kdump-tools instead of custom scripts.

Here is the content of /var/crash after a clean install & addition of the linux-crashdump meta-package that will install the necessary bits to enable kernel crash dumps (i.e. makedumpfile, kexec-tools, kdump-tools & a few more).

# find /var/crash

/var/crash

/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

This is the content of /var/crash just after the kernel dump capture and reboot, but BEFORE /usr/share/apport/kernel\_crashdump gets executed ( boot was stopped by the 'debug break=init' boot parameter) :

(initramfs) find /root/var/crash

/root/var/crash

/root/var/crash/201509160921

/root/var/crash/201509160921/dmesg.201509160921

/root/var/crash/201509160921/dump.201509160921

/root/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

This is the content of /var/crash AFTER kernel\_crashdump execution :

$ find /var/crash

/var/crash

/var/crash/linux-image-3.13.0-62-generic 3.13.0-62.102-201509160921.crash

/var/crash/201509160921

/var/crash/201509160921/dmesg.201509160921

/var/crash/201509160921/dump.201509160921

/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

The comment means that, starting with Raring, there is no longer any /var/crash/vmcore generated but rather what we see above, which is /var/crash/{timestamp}/dump.{timestamp}

Now looking at the tests & what I modified, I can see the misleading bits.

vmcore & vmcore.log tests are part of the test\_kernel\_crashdump\_kexec which tests the Pre-Raring way of gathering crash dumps, still in use in Lucid & Precise.

Post-Raring installs use kdump-tools, so their related tests are test\_kernel\_crashdump\_kdump() which will test the /var/crash content listed above.

Patches look good, my only comment would be:

> for dmesg\_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(apport.fileutils.report\_dir, '\*', 'dmesg.\*')):

would traverse a symlink, for example:

/var/crash/012345678901 > /root

This doesn't matter when symlink restrictions are on.

When symlink restrictions are disabled, the impact is minor because the glob only looks for dmesg.\* files.

I'm not sure if it is worth fixing because of the specific filename. Thoughts?

There was one additional problem which got only exhibited in the autopkgtest, as that runs against the installed binaries: When encountering dangerous log symlinks or dir permissions, kernel\_crashdump itself crashed with an OSError. This doesn't matter when running the tests from the checkout, but when running against the installed package you'll get an apport crash report for kernel\_crashdump itself (for that OSError). This fails the tests and also is not something which we want to report as a bug in the first place.

This updated patch intercepts the error and just prints a fatal error instead.

debdiff with backported patches for precise. This is a bit simpler as precise didn't yet support the kdump mode, and I dropped the python 3 bits. I added a fix for debian/tests so that the test suite actually runs. There are a lot of failures, but this makes it much easier to check/run/evaluate particular tests.

This bug was fixed in the package apport - 2.0.1-0ubuntu17.10

---------------

apport (2.0.1-0ubuntu17.10) precise-security; urgency=medium

\* SECURITY FIX: kernel\_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a

    symlink.

    This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the predictable

    .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack when the

    .crash report tries to include itself. Thanks to halfdog for discovering

    this! (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)

  \* SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files to open the report file

    exclusively.

    Fix package\_hook, kernel\_crashdump, and similar hooks to fail if the

    report already exists. This prevents privilege escalation through symlink

    attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting previous reports

    with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!

    (CVE-2015-1338, LP: [#1492570](/bugs/1492570))

  \* debian/tests/upstream-system: Change directory to /tmp, so that tests

    actually run against the installed package.

This bug was fixed in the package apport - 2.19-0ubuntu1

---------------

apport (2.19-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

\* New upstream release:

    - apport: Drop re-nicing. This might decrease the time a user has to wait

      for apport to finish the core dump for a crashed/hanging foreground

      process. (See LP #1278780)

    - kernel\_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a symlink.

      This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the

      predictable .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack

      when the .crash report tries to include itself. Thanks to halfdog for

      discovering this! (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)

    - SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files (package\_hook,

      kernel\_crashdump, and similar) to open the report file exclusively,

      i. e. fail if they already exist. This prevents privilege escalation

      through symlink attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting

      previous reports with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering

      this! (CVE-2015-1338, LP: [#1492570](/bugs/1492570))

    - apport: Ignore process restarts from systemd's watchdog. Their traces

      are usually useless as they don't have any information about the actual

      reasaon why processes hang (like VM suspends or kernel lockups with bad

      hardware) (LP: [#1433320](/bugs/1433320))

# USN-2744-1: Apport vulnerability

24 September 2015

Apport could be made to crash or overwrite files as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Halfdog discovered that Apport incorrectly handled kernel crash dump files.

A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or

possibly elevate privileges. The default symlink protections for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

### Bug Description

On Ubuntu Vivid Linux distribution upstart or SysV init invokes the program /usr/share/apport/kernel\_crashdump at boot to prepare crash dump files for sending. This action is performed with root privileges. As the crash dump directory /var/crash/ is world writable and kernel\_crashdump performs file access in unsafe manner, any local user may trigger a denial of service or escalate to root privileges. If symlink and hardlink protection is enabled (which should be the default for any modern system), only denial of service is possible.

Problematic syscall in kernel\_crashdump is:

open("/var/crash/linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic.0.crash", O\_WRONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_TRUNC|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 30

...

open("/var/crash/vmcore.log", O\_RDONLY|O\_LARGEFILE|O\_CLOEXEC) = 31

Thus the output file is opened unconditionally and without O\_EXCL or O\_NOFOLLOW. Also opening of input file does not care about links.

By sym- or hardlinking from the predictable dump file name to the vmcore.log, kernel\_crashdump will recursively include its own dump as logfile, thus filling the disk. This also works with symlink and hardlink protection turned on.

By symlinking to other files (with symlink protection off), arbitrary files can be overwritten to gain root privileges.

Thanks halfdog for discovering this! The missing O\_EXCL when creating the .crash file is a real issue indeed. The "fill the disk" aspect seems less of an issue as normal users can fill up /var/crash/ anyway (of course on ext one usually has some 5% space reserved for root only), but checking for the file to not be a symlink is trivial either way.

Wrt. the "symlink.crash" aspect, several hooks are affected by this. Only some (apportcheckresume and apport itself) already open the file with O\_EXCL. Hooks usually use fileutils.make\_report\_path(), so I propose to change that to fileutils.make\_report\_file(), and let that open the file exclusively.

Wrt. the "symlink log" aspect, I checked the other hooks with grep -r '\[.\*= (' and they seem okay. E. g. gcc\_ice\_hook is run as normal user, and apport itself already uses an fd. package\_hook attaches log files that way, but they are specified by package-shipped hooks and are thus not user controllable.

This is my proposed patch against trunk for preventing the "recursively include itself" log file issue. Note that subprocess.DEVNULL (in the test case) doesn't exist yet in Python 2, thus this will need some minor changes on backporting. I'll attach debdiffs for Ubuntu stable packages that will include both fixes, but for trunk I'd like to commit the issues separately.

Also, do you want/need a CRD for this? This should at least get a CVE; Marc, can you please assign one?

I'll backport the patches to stables once this gets a round of review and CVE/CRD.

The first patch will solve the issue only when the new crashdump is not only with e.g. O\_CREAT|O\_EXCL|O\_NOFOLLOW, and then it would not be needed any more.

With current patch, a hardlink to the crash dump would still allow DOS. If crashdump open will a) fail when dump file already exists (like above) or b) unlinks it before recreating, then self-inclusion will not be possible for both sym- and hardlinks.

This would make also sense in another way: the os.walk below is in that combination far more dangerous than the plain open:

It has the same vulnerabilities as before, but as crashdump is following into subdirectories, O\_NOFOLLOW is ineffective for TOCTOU kind of attacks, see [1].

Apart from that, the loop misses joining in the root element into the path, so os.walk will essentially walk some objects, but the open calls afterwards will just open something completely different.

With correct crashdump opening, even the misbehaving os.walk would have no effect on DOS (except producing more sym/hardlink issues).

Still working on validating second patch.

There are some parts missing here, but I think I understand what you

mean. With the second patch, the .crash file is now opened with

O\_EXCL. However, that does not do anything to prevent self-inclusion:

If you create a

/var/crash/vmcore.log -> linux\_1234.crash

then even with O\_EXCL the creation of /var/crash/linux\_1234.crash will

succeed. It will just try to slurp in the contents of itself. This is

now prevented with the os.O\_NOFOLLOW.

I don't see how a hardlink would work: You'd have to pre-create a file

/var/crash/linux\_1234.crash in order to hardlink to it, and then

kernel\_crashdump would fail to open it due to the O\_EXCL in the second

patch.

With just the first one, yes. With the second one I believe no.

Indeed, I missed that. This needs to be fixed in the second patch, to

create the .crash files there atomically too. Thanks!

I believe that's indentional. We don't want to put the .crash files

into the per-timestamp subdirs, but right into /var/crash/.

I'll post an updated second patch shortly.

@O\_EXCL: Oh, my mistake. Of course it will work for hardlinks also.

@os.walk: To put it in /var/crash directly is ok (design decision). But if I'm not wrong, current reading implementation will e.g. walk into

/var/crash/xxxx/012345678901

but then will try to open

/var/crash/012345678901/dmesg ...

which is a file not wher os.walk has walked before. I'm not sure, if this might not be used in some unwanted fashion.

Apart from that: going into a subdirectory will defeat the O\_NOFOLLOW as this is only applied to the last component (dmesg...) but not the "directory" the file is in. But also here: os symlink protection will still work over that and you need to make os.walk timerace (so you need an attacker controlled unprivileged process while kernel\_crashdump is running)

@halfdog: Indeed, the os.walk() looks pretty broken. It can potentially find stuff in subdirs of /var/crash/<timestamp>, and completely discards os.walk's "root" return value. It also uses "vmcore\_root" which is just an alias for apport.fileutils.report\_dir, which is confusing for reading the code.

@Louis: I subscribed you as he authored the kernel\_crashdump tool for kdump-tools. This is still an undisclosed bug, please don't mention any of this outside of this bug report until this gets public.

I was wondering how kdump-tools works in the first place: It seems that there is no /var/crash/vmcore or /var/crash/<timestamp>/vmcore at all, even though the comment says "kdump-tools has moved vmcore to timestamped dir"? Both the test case and kernel\_crashdump only handle picking up the "dmesg" file from /var/crash/<timestamp>/, but no .log file nor actual vmcore file? Is this missing from kernel\_crashdump and the test, or intended and the commentary is just wrong? This isn't clear from [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool) .

Can you please do an "ls -lR /var/crash" after a typical crash that is handled by kdump-tools, and show the result here?

Is this missing from kernel\_crashdump and the test, or intended and the commentary is just wrong? This isn't clear from https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool .
Can you please do an "ls -lR /var/crash" after a typical crash that is handled by kdump-tools, and show the result here?

This is the revised patch against trunk for preventing the "recursively include itself" log file issue. This now covers the "kdump-tools" case as well. This assumes that it's intended to only ever include that dmesg.\* file there, and \*not\* an actual "vmcore" file. Louis, please confirm.

Hi Martin, halfdog,

Just to be precise, I didn't author kernel\_crashdump, just adapted it to the use of kdump-tools instead of custom scripts.

Here is the content of /var/crash after a clean install & addition of the linux-crashdump meta-package that will install the necessary bits to enable kernel crash dumps (i.e. makedumpfile, kexec-tools, kdump-tools & a few more).

# find /var/crash

/var/crash

/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

This is the content of /var/crash just after the kernel dump capture and reboot, but BEFORE /usr/share/apport/kernel\_crashdump gets executed ( boot was stopped by the 'debug break=init' boot parameter) :

(initramfs) find /root/var/crash

/root/var/crash

/root/var/crash/201509160921

/root/var/crash/201509160921/dmesg.201509160921

/root/var/crash/201509160921/dump.201509160921

/root/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

This is the content of /var/crash AFTER kernel\_crashdump execution :

$ find /var/crash

/var/crash

/var/crash/linux-image-3.13.0-62-generic 3.13.0-62.102-201509160921.crash

/var/crash/201509160921

/var/crash/201509160921/dmesg.201509160921

/var/crash/201509160921/dump.201509160921

/var/crash/kexec\_cmd

The comment means that, starting with Raring, there is no longer any /var/crash/vmcore generated but rather what we see above, which is /var/crash/{timestamp}/dump.{timestamp}

Now looking at the tests & what I modified, I can see the misleading bits.

vmcore & vmcore.log tests are part of the test\_kernel\_crashdump\_kexec which tests the Pre-Raring way of gathering crash dumps, still in use in Lucid & Precise.

Post-Raring installs use kdump-tools, so their related tests are test\_kernel\_crashdump\_kdump() which will test the /var/crash content listed above.

Patches look good, my only comment would be:

> for dmesg\_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(apport.fileutils.report\_dir, '\*', 'dmesg.\*')):

would traverse a symlink, for example:

/var/crash/012345678901 > /root

This doesn't matter when symlink restrictions are on.

When symlink restrictions are disabled, the impact is minor because the glob only looks for dmesg.\* files.

I'm not sure if it is worth fixing because of the specific filename. Thoughts?

Thanks Marc, well spotted! I adjusted the first patch to check the owner of the timestamped dir, and add a test case. I also added the CVE to the commit log and NEWS entry.

Vivid debdiff with both backported patches. It builds, but I don't currently have a vivid VM handy for testing (travelling/low bandwidth). But I ran the hooks and fileutils tests as normal user and root, with py 2 and py3, so should be fine.

  (8.2 KiB,

There was one additional problem which got only exhibited in the autopkgtest, as that runs against the installed binaries: When encountering dangerous log symlinks or dir permissions, kernel\_crashdump itself crashed with an OSError. This doesn't matter when running the tests from the checkout, but when running against the installed package you'll get an apport crash report for kernel\_crashdump itself (for that OSError). This fails the tests and also is not something which we want to report as a bug in the first place.

This updated patch intercepts the error and just prints a fatal error instead.

I added a fix for debian/tests so that the test suite actually runs. There are a lot of failures, but this makes it much easier to check/run/evaluate particular tests.

apport (2.0.1-0ubuntu17.10) precise-security; urgency=medium

\* SECURITY FIX: kernel\_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a

    symlink.

    This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the predictable

    .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack when the

    .crash report tries to include itself. Thanks to halfdog for discovering

    this! (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)

  \* SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files to open the report file

    exclusively.

    Fix package\_hook, kernel\_crashdump, and similar hooks to fail if the

    report already exists. This prevents privilege escalation through symlink

    attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting previous reports

    with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!

This bug was fixed in the package apport - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.15

---------------

apport (2.14.1-0ubuntu3.15) trusty-security; urgency=medium

[ Martin Pitt ]

  \* SECURITY FIX: kernel\_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a

    symlink.

    This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the predictable

    .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack when the

    .crash report tries to include itself. Also clean up the code to make this

    easier to read: Drop the "vmcore\_root" alias, move the vmcore and

    vmcore.log cleanup into the "no kdump" section, and replace the buggy

    os.walk() loop with a glob to only catch direct timestamp subdirectories

    of /var/crash/.

    Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!

    (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)

  \* SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files to open the report file

    exclusively.

    Fix package\_hook, kernel\_crashdump, and similar hooks to fail if the

    report already exists. This prevents privilege escalation through symlink

    attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting previous reports

    with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!

This bug was fixed in the package apport - 2.19-0ubuntu1

---------------

apport (2.19-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

\* New upstream release:

    - apport: Drop re-nicing. This might decrease the time a user has to wait

      for apport to finish the core dump for a crashed/hanging foreground

      process. (See LP #1278780)

    - kernel\_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a symlink.

      This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the

      predictable .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack

      when the .crash report tries to include itself. Thanks to halfdog for

      discovering this! (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)

    - SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files (package\_hook,

      kernel\_crashdump, and similar) to open the report file exclusively,

      i. e. fail if they already exist. This prevents privilege escalation

      through symlink attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting

      previous reports with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering

      this! (CVE-2015-1338, LP: [#1492570](/bugs/1492570))

    - apport: Ignore process restarts from systemd's watchdog. Their traces

      are usually useless as they don't have any information about the actual

      reasaon why processes hang (like VM suspends or kernel lockups with bad

      hardware) (LP: [#1433320](/bugs/1433320))

# Apport 2.19 (Ubuntu 15.04) - Local Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 38353

#### CVE:

###### [2015-1338](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1338)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [halfdog](/?author=4594)

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/ApportKernelCrashdumpFileAccessVulnerabilities/

Problem description: On Ubuntu Vivid Linux distribution apport is used for automated sending of client program crash dumps but also of kernel crash dumps. For kernel crashes, upstart or SysV init invokes the program /usr/share/apport/kernel_crashdump at boot to prepare crash dump files for sending. This action is performed with root privileges. As the crash dump directory /var/crash/ is world writable and kernel_crashdump performs file access in unsafe manner, any local user may trigger a denial of service or escalate to root privileges. If symlink and hardlink protection is enabled (which should be the default for any modern system), only denial of service is possible.
Problematic syscall in kernel_crashdump is:

open("/var/crash/linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic.0.crash", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 30
...
open("/var/crash/vmcore.log", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC) = 31

Thus the output file is opened unconditionally and without O_EXCL or O_NOFOLLOW. Also opening of input file does not care about links.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Apport kernel\_crashdump symlink vulnerability exploitation

Hello List,

Here [1] is a short write-up of the Ubuntu Apport kernel_crashdump
symlink vulnerabilities fixed today including some POCs.

While symlink exploitation itself is not really exiting, the creation
of a suitable payload is more interesting: logfile data has to be
crafted, so that after splitting in chunks, compression and base64
encoding, the result string must resemble a path to an
attacker-controllable executable. See [1] to read more.

# apport 2.0.1-0ubuntu17.10 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
apport (2.0.1-0ubuntu17.10) precise-security; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY FIX: kernel_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a
    symlink.
    This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the predictable
    .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack when the
    .crash report tries to include itself. Thanks to halfdog for discovering
    this! (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP [#1492570](/bugs/1492570))
  * SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files to open the report file
    exclusively.
    Fix package_hook, kernel_crashdump, and similar hooks to fail if the
    report already exists. This prevents privilege escalation through symlink
    attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting previous reports
    with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!
    (CVE-2015-1338, LP: [#1492570](/bugs/1492570))
  * debian/tests/upstream-system: Change directory to /tmp, so that tests
    actually run against the installed package.

[apport-retrace](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/apport-retrace):
tools for reprocessing Apport crash reports

apport-retrace recombines an Apport crash report (either a file or a

 Launchpad bug) and debug symbol packages (.ddebs) into fully symbolic

 stack traces. This can optionally use a sandbox for installing debug symbol

 packages and doing the processing, so that entire process of retracing crashes

 can happen with normal user privileges without changing the system.

[dh-apport](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dh-apport):
debhelper extension for the apport crash report system

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 This package provides a debhelper extension to make it easier for other

 packages to include apport hooks.

[python-apport](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/python-apport):
apport crash report handling library

This Python package provides high-level functions for creating and

 handling apport crash reports:

 .

  \* Query available and new reports.

  \* Add OS, packaging, and process runtime information to a report.

  \* Various frontend utility functions.

  \* Python hook to generate crash reports when Python scripts fail.

[python-problem-report](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/python-problem-report):
Python library to handle problem reports

This Python library provides an interface for creating, modifying,

 and accessing standardized problem reports for program and kernel

 crashes and packaging bugs.

# USN-2744-1: Apport vulnerability

24 September 2015

Apport could be made to crash or overwrite files as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Halfdog discovered that Apport incorrectly handled kernel crash dump files.

A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or

possibly elevate privileges. The default symlink protections for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.
