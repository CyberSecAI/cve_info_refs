      "description": "The kernel_crashdump script in Apport before 2.19, as used in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, and 15.04, does not properly use the O_EXCL and O_NOFOLLOW flags with the open system call when creating the .crash files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard or symbolic link to a different file.",

          "source": "www.halfdog.net_bb4f8eab_20250125_143333.html",
          "root_cause": "The `kernel_crashdump` program, invoked at boot with root privileges, performs file access in an unsafe manner. Specifically, it opens output files unconditionally, without using `O_EXCL` or `O_NOFOLLOW` flags, and it does not check for links when opening input files.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Unsafe file access in `kernel_crashdump` using `open()` system call without proper flags like `O_EXCL` or `O_NOFOLLOW`.",
            "The crash dump directory `/var/crash/` is world-writable."

          "impact": "Local users can trigger a denial of service by creating a hard link, causing the crash dump process to recursively include its output until the disk is full. With symlink/hardlink protection disabled, local users can overwrite arbitrary files, potentially escalating to root privileges.",

           "weaknesses": [

               "The script processes files found via `os.walk`, not validating the root element, which causes it to open files that are potentially not the ones discovered by the walk process."

          "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by creating symlinks or hardlinks that cause `kernel_crashdump` to recursively include its own output, filling the disk. If symlink protection is off, an attacker could overwrite arbitrary files to gain root privileges.",
