This document provides information on multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-1679, which is a Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Windows kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory by the kernel-mode driver. This allows the disclosure of kernel memory contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Disclosure of kernel memory contents, which may reveal information about the system to an attacker.
*   The disclosed information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass security features, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during a function call within the kernel-mode driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the target system to trigger the vulnerable function call.
*   No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned other than the ability to execute code.
