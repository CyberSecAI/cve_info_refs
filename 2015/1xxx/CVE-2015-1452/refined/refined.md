    {
      "cve": "CVE-2015-1452",
      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were found within the Fortinet FortiOS software. These include a denial of service vulnerability in the CAPWAP daemon, a Man-in-the-Middle vulnerability due to the use of a universal certificate, and a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "type": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
          "root_cause": "The CAPWAP daemon is vulnerable to a DoS attack by sending multiple initial 'ClientHello' requests in quick succession during the DTLS session establishment, even with the 'HelloVerifyRequest' mechanism in place.",
          "impact": "The attack locks the CAPWAP Access Controller, leading to a denial of service condition.",
           "attack_vector": "Sending a number of initial 'ClientHello' requests to the CAPWAP daemon over DTLS.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the FortiOS device on port 5246."
        },
        {
          "type": "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)",
          "root_cause": "Fortinet devices use a universal 'Fortinet_Factory' certificate and private key for the CAPWAP DTLS protocol, which is static across all devices. The private key can be found on the device in `/etc/cert/local/Fortinet_Factory.key`.",
          "impact": "An attacker with the certificate and key can perform MitM attacks on CAPWAP traffic to retrieve sensitive information, such as wireless SSIDs and WPA passphrases.",
          "attack_vector": "Staging a MitM attack using the harvested 'Fortinet_Factory' certificate and key on the CAPWAP control protocol.",
           "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the universal private key and certificate, and the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic between CAPWAP access points and controllers."
        },
        {
          "type": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "root_cause": "Malicious JavaScript code can be inserted into the WTP Name or WTP Active Software Version fields of a crafted CAPWAP Join packet, which is then stored and rendered in the FortiOS administrative console.",
          "impact": "Successful XSS exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code in a user's browser while they are using the FortiOS administrative console.",
           "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted CAPWAP Join packet with malicious JavaScript to the target device.",
           "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted CAPWAP join request and a user to access the administrative console."
