**Summary:**

The provided documents discuss a vulnerability in Landsknecht Adminsystems CMS v. 4.0.1 (DEV, beta version) related to unrestricted file uploads. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2015-1604. The content also refers to XSS vulnerabilities, which are assigned to CVE-2015-1603.

**CVE-2015-1604 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper restrictions on file uploads in the `asys/site/files.php` script. The system does not validate file extensions or rename uploaded files, allowing users to upload arbitrary files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unrestricted file upload:** The system allows users and administrators to upload any type of file, including those with executable extensions.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not perform any checks on the file type being uploaded.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) with an executable extension, then execute it by directly accessing the file via the webserver, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A registered user or administrator can upload a malicious file via the upload form at `http://{TARGET}/asys/site/files.php?action=upload&path=/`.
    *   The attacker then directly accesses the uploaded file through `http://{TARGET}/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE}`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user or an administrator of the system to access the file upload form.
    *   The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application to upload files and access the vulnerable endpoint.
