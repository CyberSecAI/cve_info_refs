I only asked Fady because of a potential flaw that I found while developing this patch (see below).

The app and extension do slightly different things. They both fire XHR but the extension is the one which triggers the navigation which ultimately completes the test. This way of finishing the test seems arbitrary to me actually; it's interesting to use the webRequest API to trigger it, but it would be simpler to use extension messaging to communicate.  2. As I mentioned, it would be good to also have a test for a website that hosts an extension's (web accessible of course) iframe, since that should bypass the process ID check.  3. It would be good to test what functionality is supposed to work; intercepting requests from yourself. It should be pretty straightforward to modify the "main" extension to do an XHR before continuing with its test assertion.

I think the question is can extensions share a render process host ID?  I had always assumed that an RPH is an abstraction of a process, so the process manager infrastructure can choose to host two RPHs in the same OS process but that's an implementation detail.  However come to think of it I've never actually asked anybody that question. ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org | | --- | | 5 years, 4 months ago (2015-08-05 18:53:36 UTC) [#19](#msg19) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | Try jobs failed on following builders: mac\_chromium\_10.10\_rel\_ng on tryserver.chromium.mac (JOB\_TIMED\_OUT, http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.chromium.mac/builders/mac\_chromium\_10.10\_rel\_ng/builds/2197) | | --- | | 5 years, 4 months ago (2015-08-05 18:53:36 UTC) [#20](#msg20) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Try jobs failed on following builders:   mac_chromium_10.10_rel_ng on tryserver.chromium.mac (JOB_TIMED_OUT, [http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.chromium.mac/builders/mac_chromium_10.1...](http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.chromium.mac/builders/mac_chromium_10.10_rel_ng/builds/2197)) ```     | **robwu** | | The CQ bit was checked by rob@robwu.nl | | --- | | 5 years, 4 months ago (2015-08-05 18:55:40 UTC) [#21](#msg21) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was checked by rob@robwu.nl ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | CQ is trying da patch.

Tuesday, September 1, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 45 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 45.0.2454.85 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/44.0.2403.157..45.0.2454.85?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 45.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [29 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M45). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[526825](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=526825)] CVE-2015-1301: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.5 branch (currently 4.5.103.29).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1291, CVE-2015-1292, CVE-2015-1293, CVE-2015-1294,
CVE-2015-1295, CVE-2015-1296, CVE-2015-1297, CVE-2015-1298, CVE-2015-1299,
CVE-2015-1300, CVE-2015-1301)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 45.0.2454.85, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

# CVE-2015-1296

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1295.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1297.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1296 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1296)

#### Description

The UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl implementation in net/base/escape.cc in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not prevent display of Unicode LOCK characters in the omnibox, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof the SSL lock icon by placing one of these characters at the end of a URL, as demonstrated by the omnibox in localizations for right-to-left languages.

[CVE-2015-1297 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1297)
