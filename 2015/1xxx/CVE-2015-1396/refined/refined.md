Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-1396:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2015-1396 is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2015-1196) in GNU patch. This incomplete fix still allows directory traversal via specially crafted patch files containing symbolic links, particularly in "git-style" patches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial patch for CVE-2015-1196 was insufficient to prevent directory traversal using symlinks in patch files.
-   **Unvalidated Symlinks:** The `patch` utility did not properly validate symbolic links present in patch files, allowing for manipulation of the file system.
-   **Git-style Patch Vulnerability:** The vulnerability specifically affected the handling of symlinks within Git-style patches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can craft a malicious patch file containing symlinks, which, when applied by a user, will lead to arbitrary file overwrites with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** If a privileged user applies a malicious patch, it could lead to privilege escalation or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Patch Files:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker creating a specially crafted patch file.
-   **User Interaction:** An unsuspecting user must apply this malicious patch file using the `patch` utility for exploitation to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Patch Creation:** An attacker needs the ability to create a patch file containing malicious symlinks.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to rely on social engineering to get a user to apply the malicious patch file.
-   **No Network Access Requirement:** Exploitation does not rely on network access; the attacker simply needs to deliver the malicious file to a user.
