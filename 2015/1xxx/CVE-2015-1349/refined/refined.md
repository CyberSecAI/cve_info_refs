Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-1349:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is an issue in how BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) handles trust anchor management during DNSSEC key rollovers. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when a previously trusted key is revoked, and there are no other trusted keys available, but a standby key exists which is not yet trusted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Trust Anchor Management:** The core issue lies in the flawed logic of trust anchor management, specifically during key rollovers in DNSSEC.
*   **Assertion Failure:** Under specific circumstances involving revoked, untrusted, and standby keys, the named service will trigger an assertion failure and crash.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash of the named service leads to a denial of service, preventing the DNS server from resolving queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Service disruption:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the named daemon crashing. This means that the DNS service becomes unavailable, preventing the resolution of domain names, impacting network services.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service as named (the DNS server) crashes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can trigger this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted DNS queries.
*   **Invalid DNSSEC key rollover:** This can be caused by errors in the configuration of the DNSSEC zone, or by network interference by an attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS queries to a vulnerable BIND server.
*   **DNSSEC familiarity:** The attacker needs some understanding of DNSSEC and how to craft queries that trigger the specific trust anchor management flaw.
*   **DNSSEC Validation enabled:** The target must have DNSSEC validation and the managed-keys feature enabled.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue affects configurations where `dnssec-lookaside auto;` or `dnssec-validation auto;` is used (which is enabled in the Mageia default config).
*   The vulnerability affects BIND versions 9.7.0 and later (up to 9.9.6, 9.10.1) but prior to 9.9.7-P2 and 9.10.2-P3.
*   Patches have been created for BIND 9.9.6 and 9.10.x.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jan-Piet Mens.
*   Some vendors noted that this vulnerability may be hard to trigger, while others such as SUSE rate it as a critical issue.

**Relevant information from different sources:**

*   **Mageia:** Provides details about the updated packages and a testing procedure using dig to check for regression. The update also introduced issues related to file locations in the chroot environment which are not related to the vulnerability itself.
*   **SUSE:** Has multiple entries, including one for CVE-2015-1349 with a base score, and list multiple updates released to address the vulnerability. Also mentions a related bugzilla entry 918330 with additional information. Notes that this vulnerability, though rated as moderate by NVD, is considered critical by SUSE. Provides a comprehensive list of affected product versions with fixed package versions and patch names.
*   **Debian:** The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3162-1) provides details about the vulnerability, and fixes in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u4.
*  **Ubuntu:** Security Notice (USN-2503-1) outlines the issue and provides updated packages for Ubuntu 14.10, 14.04 and 12.04.
*  **Red Hat:** Provides an advisory (RHSA-2015:0672) detailing the vulnerability and lists the updated packages for affected products.
*   **Gentoo:** Security advisory (GLSA 201510-01) states that a remote attacker may be able to cause a Denial of Service condition via specially constructed zone data.

The provided documents offer a good overview of CVE-2015-1349, detailing its cause, impact, attack vectors, and the steps taken by various Linux distributions to address it with patches and updated packages.
