  CVE-2015-1169 - CAS Server 3.5.2 allows remote attackers to bypass LDAP
authentication via crafted wildcards.

  Reporter: José Tozo  < juniorbsd () gmail com >

=====[1. Background]======================================

 CAS is an authentication system originally created by Yale University to
provide a trusted way for an application to authenticate a user.

=====[2. Detailed description]============================

A valid username and password required.

Given a username johndoe and a password superpass, you can sucessfully
achieve login using wildcards:

username: jo*
password: superpass

The login will be sucessfully only if the ldap bind search return one
unique member.

The vulnerability described in this document can be validated using the
following example:

Client Request:
root@machine:/# curl -k -L -d "username=jo%2A&password=superpass"
<https://login.cas-server.com/v1/tickets>

(note that * was url encoded to %2A)

=====[3. Other contexts & solutions]======================

 In order to apply the patch, you have to update at least to version 3.5.3.
Newer versions, such as CAS 4.0.0 and above, are not vulnerable.

This prevents LDAP injection attacks. Note this patch is only relevant for the 3.5.x branch since master is based on ldaptive, which properly handles character escaping.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Good suggestion on test. LDAP tests are notoriously difficult due to lack of a test fixture that provides a directory to test against, but testing encoding may be possible. |
