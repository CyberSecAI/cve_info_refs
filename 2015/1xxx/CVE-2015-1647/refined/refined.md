- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input within the Virtual Machine Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Hyper-V.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by running a specially crafted application within a virtual machine (VM) session. While this does not allow code execution or privilege escalation on other VMs, it can cause other VMs on the host to become unmanageable in Virtual Machine Manager.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves running a specially crafted application within a virtual machine (VM) session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to execute code within a virtual machine.
