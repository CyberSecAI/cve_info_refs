## Vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V Could Allow Denial of Service (3047234)

Published: April 14, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if an authenticated attacker runs a specially crafted application in a virtual machine (VM) session. Note that the denial of service does not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate user rights on other VMs running on the Hyper-V host; however, it could cause other VMs on the host to not be manageable in Virtual Machine Manager.

This security update is rated Important for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Virtual Machine Manager validates user input. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3047234](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3047234).
