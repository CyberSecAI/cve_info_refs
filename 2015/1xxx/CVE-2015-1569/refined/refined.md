Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in FortiClient mobile applications:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Keys:** The Android application uses a hardcoded string "FoRtInEt!AnDrOiD" as an encryption key to secure data within Shared Preferences. This key is static and does not change between instances of the application.
*   **Broken SSL Certificate Validation:** Both the Android and iOS versions of the application do not properly validate SSL certificates when connecting to SSL VPN servers and for the Endpoint Control protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded encryption key:**  The use of a static, hardcoded key for encryption. This makes the encryption easily reversible.
*   **Missing SSL certificate validation:** Failure to validate SSL certificates exposes users to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Specifically, the iOS version of the application does not display any warnings even when server certificate validation is enabled. This is also the case for the Endpoint Control protocol for both platforms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** An attacker can decrypt stored passwords and other sensitive information from any FortiClient Android application using the hardcoded encryption key.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**
    *   Attackers can intercept and modify communications, gaining access to user credentials (SSL VPN) and mobile device details. This is due to the lack of proper SSL certificate validation.
    *   For the Endpoint Control protocol, attackers can intercept and potentially manipulate communications as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hardcoded key:** The attacker needs to decompile the Android application to retrieve the hardcoded key. They can then use this key to decrypt locally stored data on the device, or data obtained from other devices.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle:** Attacker positions themselves between the user and the server, intercepting network traffic. The attacker needs to host their own server with a self-signed certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hardcoded key:** The attacker must have access to the FortiClient Android application files and possess the ability to decompile and analyze the code.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the victim, or via compromised network infrastructure. They need to have a malicious server with a self-signed certificate to present to the FortiClient.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was verified on FortiClient iOS v5.2.028 and FortiClient Android 5.2.3.091.
*   The advisory includes Java code demonstrating how to decrypt data encrypted with the hardcoded key.
*   The Android version shows a warning prompt in some cases, but iOS does not show any warnings, regardless of the 'check server certificate' setting.
*   The Endpoint Control protocol (TCP port 8010) is also affected by the lack of SSL certificate validation on both platforms.
*   There was no official solution available at the time of the advisory release.
