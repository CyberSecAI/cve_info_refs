- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability and trick the user into visiting it. They could also inject malicious content into compromised websites, user-provided content, or ads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website the victim might visit and convince the user to visit the site via a link or by opening an attachment. The attacker does not have to be local to the victim.
