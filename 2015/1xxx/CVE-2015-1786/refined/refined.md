  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zend\\Validator\\Csrf component in Zend Framework 2.3 series was not correctly identifying null or mal-formatted token identifiers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of CSRF tokens. Specifically, the component was not correctly identifying null or malformed token identifiers, resulting in false positive validations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "This leads to a potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious request with a null or malformed CSRF token, which would be incorrectly validated by the vulnerable component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to craft requests to the vulnerable application with invalid CSRF tokens and trick a user into submitting the request."
