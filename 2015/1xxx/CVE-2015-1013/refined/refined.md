Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Incorrect default permissions assigned to the "PI SQL (AF) Trusted Users" group in OSIsoft PI AF installations. Specifically, the "Everyone" account was sometimes included in this group by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The "PI SQL (AF) Trusted Users" group, which should have restricted access, was sometimes configured to include the "Everyone" account. This granted broad, unintended access to the PI AF SQL database.
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** Users in the "PI SQL (AF) Trusted Users" group can bypass most security checks applied to SQL statements, allowing them to execute commands without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers could modify or corrupt data within the PI AF SQL database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data stored in the database could be accessed and exposed.
*   **Repudiation:** Attackers could perform actions that are difficult to trace back to them.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Attackers could gain higher levels of access than intended.
*   **Denial of Service:** The system could be rendered unavailable or unstable due to malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill:** An attacker with low skill is able to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in PI AF 2.6 (new installs), PI AF 2.7 (upgrade), and PI SQL for AF 2.1.
*   OSIsoft has provided mitigation steps, including removing the "Everyone" user from the affected group and ensuring correct access is granted to necessary service accounts.
*   The advisory recommends minimizing network exposure for control system devices and using secure remote access methods (like VPNs) with caution.
