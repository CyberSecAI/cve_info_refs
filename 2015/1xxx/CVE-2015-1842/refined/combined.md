For example:  class{ 'pacemaker':   hacluster_pwd => 'newpassord' }   Is there anything that you think it should be done at this level?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c0)  Assaf Muller    2015-03-30 15:40:47 UTC  ``` The RHEL OSP installer has l2pop on and turns on l3_ha if Neutron is installed on multiple controllers. However, due to RHBZ 1177611, l2pop and l3_ha do not work together. More precisely, routers will not work correctly and there will be no network connectivity whatsoever.  Until this issue is resolved, l3_ha should never be turned on implicitly. If an admin would like to evaluate the feature, he should do so manually.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c5)  Mike Burns    2015-03-31 14:39:34 UTC  ``` Verification steps:  With a single controller:  l3_ha should always be disabled l2_population should be set based on user input in the wizard  With multiple controllers:  If user sets l2_population to true, l3_ha should be set off in neutron config if user sets l2_population to false, l3_ha should be set on in neutron config   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c6)  Assaf Muller    2015-03-31 15:09:40 UTC  ``` To validate l2pop is on: ml2_conf.ini on controllers: mechanism_drivers list should contain 'l2population', so should look like: mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,l2population  On any node that has the OVS agent (This would include controllers): ovs_neutron_plugin.ini: l2_population = True  To validate l3_ha is on: neutron.conf on controllers: l3_ha = True   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c7)  ktenzer    2015-03-31 16:09:02 UTC  ``` Using RHEL OSP 6.0.1 RHEL 7.1 and deploying a 1x controller 1x compute node will result in both l2_population and l3_ha enabled as these are the defaults. I also confirmed l3 routing does not work completely with both of these features enabled...traffic cant traverse router and br-ex physical interface properly.  I tried to disable l3_ha manually and through staypuft without success. Only option was redploy and ensure option is false.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c8)  Scott Seago    2015-03-31 16:46:29 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/theforeman/staypuft/pull/430>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c10)  Alexander Chuzhoy    2015-04-01 18:44:23 UTC  ``` Following [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c6):  Part 1: To validate l2pop is on: ml2_conf.ini on controllers: mechanism_drivers list should contain 'l2population', so should look like: mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,l2population  Checking a controller: /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini:mechanism_drivers =openvswitch,l2population  Good!   Part2: On any node that has the OVS agent (This would include controllers): ovs_neutron_plugin.ini: l2_population = True   No such line, in fact - the only l2_population line is: /etc/neutron/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_neutron_plugin.ini:# l2_population = False   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c11)  Alexander Chuzhoy    2015-04-01 18:45:53 UTC  ``` Tested with ruby193-rubygem-staypuft-0.5.22-1.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c12)  Leonid Natapov    2015-04-05 09:17:54 UTC  ``` Tested on ruby193-rubygem-staypuft-0.5.0-22-1.el7ost.  According to Assaf l2_population must be enabled in /etc/neutron/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_neutron_plugin.ini ,e.g. l2_population=True  The only line related to l2_population in that file is:  # l2_population = False  Moving back to assign.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c13)  Mike Burns    2015-04-05 15:27:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Leonid Natapov from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c12)) > Tested on ruby193-rubygem-staypuft-0.5.0-22-1.el7ost. >  > According to Assaf l2_population must be enabled in > /etc/neutron/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_neutron_plugin.ini ,e.g. > l2_population=True >  > The only line related to l2_population in that file is: >  > # l2_population = False >  > Moving back to assign.  That's a new bug, then, not a reason to fail this BZ.  This bz is specifically to prevent L3-HA and l2pop from being enabled together (by default, since a user can set these as they want in advanced parameters).   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c14)  Leonid Natapov    2015-04-06 04:48:36 UTC  ``` verified on ruby193-rubygem-staypuft-0.5.0-22-1.el7ost   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1207284#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-07 15:09:05 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0791.html>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0830)

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer packages that
fix one security issue and several bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise OpenStack Platform Installer is a deployment management
tool. It provides a web user interface for managing the installation and
configuration of remote systems. Deployment of changes is performed using
Puppet. Additionally, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain
Name System (DNS), Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), and Trivial File
Transfer Protocol (TFTP) services can be provided. Controlling these
services also enables provisioning of physical systems that do not yet have
an operating system installed.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

Note: This flaw only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
installations deployed using the HA feature set.

For additional information on addressing this flaw see:
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/1396123>

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

The augeas package has been upgraded to version 1.0.0-7, which provides a
number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1198236)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* A problem with cloned constraints for neutron caused RHEL OpenStack

Platform deployments to fail. This update corrects the cloned constraints,
and deployments are now successful. (BZ#1209628)

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer users are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0789)

## Topic

Updated openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules packages that fix
one security issue and several bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

PackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing
servers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either
interactively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a
text file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack
parameters. PackStack is suitable for proof-of-concept installations.
PackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept installations.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* If OpenStack Networking is enabled, Packstack would display a warning if

the Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117277)

* A quiet dependency on a newer version of selinux-policy causes

openstack-selinux 0.6.23 to fail to install modules when paired with
selinux-policy packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 or 7.0.z.
This causes Identity and other OpenStack services to receive 'AVC' denials
and malfunction under some circumstances. The following workarounds allow
the OpenStack services to function correctly:

1) Leave openstack-selinux at 0.6.18-2.el7ost until you are ready to update
to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1. At that time, a 'yum update' will resolve
the issue.

2) Install the updated selinux-policy and selinux-policy-targeted packages
from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 (version selinux-policy-3.13.1-23.el7 or
later), then update openstack-selinux to version 0.6.23-1.el7ost.
(BZ#1195252)

* A typo in the code caused a Sahara option that uses OpenStack Networking

to be always false. Sahara now uses OpenStack Networking if the parameter
'CONFIG\_NEUTRON\_INSTALL is set to 'y'. (BZ#1199047)

* Prior to this update, users had to install the OpenStack Unified Client

separately after an installation of Packstack. Packstack now installs it by
default. (BZ#1199114)

* This enhancement updates Packstack to retain temporary directories when

running an installation in debug mode. This assists with troubleshooting
activities. As a result, temporary directories are not deleted when running
Packstack with the --debug command line option. (BZ#1199565)

* Prior to this update, some validators did not use 'validate\_not\_empty' to

ensure that certain parameters contained values. As a result, a number of
internal validations could not be properly handled, leading to the
possibility of unexpected errors. This update fixes validators to use
validate\_not\_empty when required, resulting in correct validation behavior
from validators. (BZ#11995889)

In addition to the above issues, this update also addresses bugs and
enhancements which can be found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform Technical Notes, linked to in the References section.

All openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0791)

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer packages that
fix one security issue and several bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise OpenStack Platform Installer is a deployment management
tool. It provides a web user interface for managing the installation and
configuration of remote systems. Deployment of changes is performed using
Puppet. Additionally, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain
Name System (DNS), Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), and Trivial File
Transfer Protocol (TFTP) services can be provided. Controlling these
services also enables provisioning of physical systems that do not yet have
an operating system installed.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

Note: This flaw only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
installations deployed using the HA feature set.

For additional information on addressing this flaw see:
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/1396123>

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

In addition to the above issue, this update also addresses multiple bugs
which are documented in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Technical Notes, linked to in the References section.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer users are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1201875#c0)  Fabio Olive Leite    2015-03-13 17:29:54 UTC  ``` It was discovered that openstack-puppet-modules as used by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installers would always use the default password of "CHANGEME" when deploying pcsd in HA environments.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1201875#c1)  Fabio Olive Leite    2015-03-13 17:43:35 UTC  ```  Created pcs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1201884](show_bug.cgi?id=1201884 "CLOSED NOTABUG - pcs: RHEL-OSP6 is deployed with default pcsd password [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1201875#c2)  Garth Mollett    2015-03-30 01:14:47 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1200322](show_bug.cgi?id=1200322 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - RHEL-OSP6 is deployed with default PCSD password") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1201875#c3)  Ivan Chavero    2015-03-30 20:56:47 UTC  ``` The password in the module [1] is just a default that is should to be set by the puppet manifest (for example staypuft manifests) that uses the module.  For example:  class{ 'pacemaker':   hacluster_pwd => 'newpassord' }   Is there anything that you think it should be done at this level?

I re-installed to verify the answers for your questions.  a) Horizon works now (for some reason..) and I can access it via https. due i have to say it seems that the login stage is a bit slow..  b) the output of get-vnc-console is an https url.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1204482#c9)  Lars Kellogg-Stedman    2015-03-26 13:41:00 UTC  ``` I've had a chance to look at this environment, and there are at least two things going on here. The error described in this biz...      ValidationError: Origin header protocol does not match this host.  ...is caused because nova-novncproxy is comparing the protocol being used to access the proxy (https) against the url used in novavncproxy_base_url in /etc/nova/nova.conf.  This is a problem, because in general that setting is only required on the compute nodes, and is left unset on the controller.  The short term solution is to modify that setting on the controller to match the setting on the compute hosts:      novncproxy_base_url=<https://10.35.161.235:6080/vnc_auto.html>  Setting this resolves the 'protocol does not match' error.  However, I am still unable to get the console to operate because novncproxy is throwing the following exception:  2015-03-26 15:36:38.726 25407 INFO nova.console.websocketproxy [-] Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/websockify/websocket.py", line 697, in top_new_client   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/websockify/websocket.py", line 629, in do_handshake     # Continue on to handle WebSocket upgrade AttributeError: WSRequestHandler instance has no attribute 'last_code'  The Internet suggests that this may be indicative of some sort of certificate problem, although it also appears to be a clear bug in nova-novncproxy, which is expecting this attribute to be available at all times when clearly it is not.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1204482#c10)  Lars Kellogg-Stedman    2015-03-26 16:06:59 UTC  ``` With websockify 0.6.0, the "WSRequestHandler instance has no attribute 'last_code'" exception is gone, but the browser connection is still closing for some reason...but I can't rule out my connectivity to the TLV lab, which seems to be pretty awful today.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0832)

## Topic

Updated openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules packages that fix
one security issue and adds one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

PackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing
servers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either
interactively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a
text file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack
parameters. PackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept
installations.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* If OpenStack Networking (neutron) is enabled, Packstack now displays a

warning if the Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117115)

All openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add
this enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 6 runs on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.6.

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 6 Release Notes
(see References section) contain the following:

* An explanation of the way in which the provided components interact to

form a working cloud computing environment.

* Technology Previews, Recommended Practices, and Known Issues.
* The channels required for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5

for RHEL 6, including which channels need to be enabled and disabled.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0831)

## Topic

Updated openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules packages that fix
one security issue and adds one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

PackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing
servers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either
interactively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a
text file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack
parameters. PackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept
installations.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell
commands as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* If OpenStack Networking (neutron) is enabled, Packstack now displays a

warning if the Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117115)

All openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which corrects this issue and adds
this enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
