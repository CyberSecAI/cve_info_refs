- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper management of same-origin policy in Microsoft Exchange web applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could:
    - Scan and attack systems behind a firewall that are normally inaccessible from the outside world.
    - Enumerate and attack services running on these host systems.
    - Exploit host-based authentication services.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a specially crafted web application request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted web application request to the Exchange server.
