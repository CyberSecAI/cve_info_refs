Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1416:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `patch(1)` utility, when handling files under version control systems like SCCS and RCS, used `sprintf` (in older versions) or similar string formatting functions to construct shell commands that interact with these systems (e.g. "checkout" command). These commands included the filename extracted from the patch file.
- The vulnerability arises from the fact that the filename was not properly sanitized before being inserted into the command string. This allows for shell metacharacters to be introduced through a crafted filename in the patch file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Shell injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the filename allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the command that `patch(1)` executes via `system()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running `patch(1)`.
- **Privilege escalation:** If a privileged user (e.g., root) applies a maliciously crafted patch file, this could lead to privilege escalation on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted patch file is needed. This patch file needs to include a filename that contains shell metacharacters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious patch file and persuade a user to apply it using the vulnerable `patch(1)` utility. This might involve tricking the user into downloading and applying the file or providing the patch to an automated system that uses the utility.

**Affected Versions**
-  FreeBSD 10.x
- GNU patch before 2.3, or before 2.2.5.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in various BSD versions of `patch(1)` (FreeBSD, Bitrig, OpenBSD, NetBSD) which inherited the vulnerable code from Larry Wall's original `patch(1)`.
- The vulnerability was also present in GNU patch in similar code structure and with some identical variable names.
- The fix in GNU patch uses a `quote_system_arg` function, or similar quoting methods to sanitize the filename before it is passed to `system()`, preventing shell injection. Older version of quote_system_arg might have also been unsafe.
- The CVE is not associated with later changes between versions 2.5 and 2.5.2/2.5.3 where some instances of "filename" have a "quotearg (filename)" replacement,
