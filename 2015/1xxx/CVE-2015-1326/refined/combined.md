# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

SECURITY FIX: Prevent code execution through crafted pyc files

```
When loading a template from an arbitrary file through the AddTemplate() D-Bus
method call or DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template() Python method, don't create
or use Python's *.pyc cached files.By tricking a user into loading a template
from a world-writable directory like /tmp, an attacker could run arbitrary code
with the user's privileges by putting a crafted .pyc file into that directory.

Note that this is highly unlikely to actually appear in practice as custom
dbusmock templates are usually shipped in project directories, not directly in
world-writable directories.

Thanks to Simon McVittie for discovering this!
