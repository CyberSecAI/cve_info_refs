Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-1637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Secure Channel (Schannel) component of Microsoft Windows, specifically within the TLS state machine. A client system may accept an RSA key with a shorter key length than the originally negotiated key length during a TLS handshake. This behavior is caused by a flaw in how Schannel enforces cipher suite policies during server key exchanges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended security mechanisms of the TLS protocol by downgrading the RSA key length.
- **Insecure Cipher Suites:** The vulnerability is triggered when a server supports RSA export cipher suites, which are intentionally weakened for export purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A successful attack allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. They can intercept the TLS connection and force the use of export-grade RSA keys with shorter key lengths than originally negotiated.
- **Decryption of Encrypted Traffic:**  After forcing the use of weaker encryption, the attacker can decrypt the intercepted traffic, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Data Manipulation:**  Beyond eavesdropping, attackers could potentially manipulate the decrypted traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between a vulnerable client and server. This implies a network-based MitM attack vector.
- **Client-Side Vulnerability:** The client-side component of the TLS handshake within Schannel is vulnerable, allowing for downgrading of key lengths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MitM Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network communications between a client and a server. This typically requires a position on the network path between the client and server.
- **Vulnerable Server:** The server must support export-grade RSA cipher suites for the attack to be successful.
- **Vulnerable Client:** The client system must be running a version of Windows with the vulnerable Schannel implementation.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to the "FREAK" attack, which is an industry-wide issue not specific to Windows.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting the cipher suite enforcement policies in Schannel.
- Systems running Windows Server 2003 require additional steps after patching to disable export ciphers.
- Workarounds exist, using Group Policy to disable RSA key exchange ciphers, however, these may interfere with connections to systems that do not support other cipher suites.
