Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1042:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient URL sanitization routine within MantisBT. Specifically, the regular expression used to check for URLs pointing to external domains incorrectly identified URLs with a single slash (e.g., `http:/google.com`) as local URLs. This allowed for cross-domain redirection, even after a previous fix was implemented for CVE-2014-6316.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Open Redirection:** The primary weakness is an open redirection vulnerability. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize URLs, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary external websites.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix for a similar vulnerability (CVE-2014-6316) was incomplete and did not account for URLs with a single slash, leading to this new vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious website that mimics the legitimate site. This can be used to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect users to websites that host malware.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:** Although not explicitly mentioned, open redirects can sometimes be chained with XSS for more severe attacks.
- **Reputational Damage:** Exploitation can lead to a loss of trust in the legitimate website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URL Parameter:** Attackers can craft a URL with a malicious redirect target in the `return` parameter of the `login_page.php` script.
    - Example: `http://example.com/mantis/login_page.php?return=https:/google.com`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Publicly Accessible Application:** The attacker needs access to an instance of MantisBT where the vulnerability exists (versions 1.2.0a3 through 1.2.18).
- **Basic Understanding of URL Structure:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious redirect targets.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was initially discovered by Alejo Popovici while testing the fix for CVE-2014-6316.
- The vulnerability affects certain browsers (Firefox 34 and Chrome 39) but not Internet Explorer 11.
- The issue was fixed in MantisBT version 1.2.19, by modifying the regex used in `core/string_api.php`.
- The fix involved changing the regex from `@(?:[^:]\*)?://@` to `@(?:[^:]\*)?:/*@`
