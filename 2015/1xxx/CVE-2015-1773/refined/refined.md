**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `asdoc` tool in Apache Flex produced JavaScript code vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in a user's web browser by tricking the user to click on a specially crafted link.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted URL is used.
- The victim must click on the attacker's crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in the JavaScript output of the `asdoc` tool, not the output of the `mxmlc` compiler or deployed Apache Flex applications.
- The affected versions are all Apache Flex versions before 4.14.1
- Mitigation involves upgrading to the most recent version of Apache Flex, regenerating files produced by `asdoc`, and applying specific changes to the generated `index.html` files.
