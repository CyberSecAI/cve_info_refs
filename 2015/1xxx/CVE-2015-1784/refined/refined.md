Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient validation of user-uploaded files in the NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress. This allows attackers to bypass both client-side and server-side checks and upload malicious files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unsafe Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin fails to properly validate file extensions, content types, and file headers, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions (e.g., .php) disguised as image files (e.g., by adding a fake image header to a PHP file).
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The file upload functionality lacks proper CSRF protection (e.g., missing nonces or tokens). This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by a logged-in user, can upload arbitrary files without the user's knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP webshell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system takeover, access to databases, and defacement.
*   **Complete Application Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code allows attackers to fully control the web application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct File Upload:** An attacker with upload privileges (e.g., an editor or subscriber, or an administrator if that is enabled) can upload a malicious file by intercepting and modifying the upload request.
*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious page that, when visited by a logged-in user with upload privileges, triggers an upload request without the user's knowledge. This exploits the lack of CSRF protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Direct File Upload:** The attacker needs an account with upload privileges on the WordPress site (at least editor/subscriber level, but this might extend to unauthenticated users depending on the settings)
*   **CSRF Attack:** The attacker does not need an account on the target WordPress site but needs to trick a logged-in user with upload privileges (administrator, editor, or subscriber) into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a link.
