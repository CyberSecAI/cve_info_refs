The provided content describes a vulnerability chain in Magento, involving multiple CVEs, including CVE-2015-1398. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in a combination of flaws within Magento's core code:

1.  **Controller Injection:** The system allows the injection of module names into the controller loading process. While there is a whitelist, it can be bypassed by injecting the 'Adminhtml' context in user context.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** The system uses a 'forwarded' parameter which, when present, circumvents authentication checks and provides access to admin modules. This allows unauthorized access to restricted controllers.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The 'Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid' class uses user-controlled input for SQL queries without proper sanitization. By manipulating the 'field_expr' parameter in range conditions, an attacker can control the field name, and inject arbitrary SQL queries due to the use of PDO with multiple query support enabled by default (`PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES` set to `true`).
4.  **File Inclusion Vulnerability (LFI/RFI):** Using a combination of the SQL injection, an attacker can store a malicious file in the server's media folder. The vulnerability is exploited using the  `phar://` wrapper that allows to include a file even if the path ends with `/` and allows execution of the bootstrap stub. This bypasses the `ExecCGI` protection in the media folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Controller Loading:** Lack of strict validation of module names during controller loading.
*   **Insecure Authentication Logic:** The use of a simple, externally controlled parameter ('forwarded') to bypass authentication checks.
*   **SQL Injection Flaw:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied data in SQL queries, allowing arbitrary SQL injection.
*   **Unsafe File Inclusion:** The ability to include arbitrary files using the phar:// wrapper bypassing directory restrictions.
*   **Vulnerable Class Method Calls:** Using `setDataUsingMethod` allows calling arbitrary methods with user controlled input, and using `blockDirective` allows calling any block class method without arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the SQL injection, file upload, and file inclusion vulnerabilities. This leads to full system compromise.
*   **Database Compromise:** Complete control over the Magento database, enabling theft of sensitive data such as credit card information and personal data.
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker can gain administrative control of the online store, allowing full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is primarily through:

*   **HTTP Requests:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the Magento server by manipulating the URL and parameters.
*   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code through HTTP parameters.
*   **File Inclusion:** Leveraging the SQL injection and phar wrapper to force the inclusion of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication or user account is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Magento server.
*   **Knowledge of Magento Vulnerabilities:**  Detailed knowledge of Magento's internal structure and the specific vulnerabilities is necessary.
