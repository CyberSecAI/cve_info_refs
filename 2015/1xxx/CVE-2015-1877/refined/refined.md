Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-1877:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of local variables within the `open_generic_xdg_mime` function in `xdg-open` when executed under `dash` (the default `/bin/sh` in Debian).
*   Specifically, when a variable is declared as `local` within a shell function in `dash`, it inherits its initial value from the same variable name in the surrounding scope, if one exists. This dynamic scoping behavior leads to a name collision, and an attacker can influence the value of the local variable in a way not intended by the program.
*   This behavior differs from `bash`, where the `local` declaration properly creates a new, independent variable.

**Weakness:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows for command injection because a crafted filename or URL can introduce malicious code that gets executed when the `xdg-open` attempts to process it with `sed` within a shell function. The injected code takes advantage of a weakly sanitized variable when expanding the command to be executed.

**Impact:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the user's environment.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, as an attacker could craft a malicious file or URL that, when opened by a user via `xdg-open`, triggers the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted filename as an argument to `xdg-open`.
*   **Crafted URL:** An attacker provides a specially crafted URL as an argument to `xdg-open`.
*   The crafted file or URL contains malicious code that exploits the weak sanitization of variables in the `open_generic_xdg_mime` function, using the variable name collision to insert and execute the attacker's code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a crafted filename or URL to a user:** An attacker needs to be able to make the victim user to use xdg-open to open a malicious file or url
*   The user needs to be running `xdg-utils` with `/bin/sh` linked to `dash`.
*   The system must be running a desktop environment not explicitly supported by `xdg-open` (KDE, GNOME, MATE, XFCE, or ENLIGHTENMENT), which would cause `xdg-open` to use the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by how `dash` handles local variables in shell functions when a variable name collision occurs
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2014-9622 in that it is related to command injection in xdg-utils
*   The fix involves properly sanitizing inputs or using a more secure way to handle local variables in `dash`, which is achieved in the provided diff by not relying on the value of the local variable before assignment.
*   The issue is not present if `/bin/sh` is linked to `bash` instead of `dash`.
