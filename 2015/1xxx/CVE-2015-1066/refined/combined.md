## Security Update 2015-002

* **IOAcceleratorFamily**

  Available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, and OS X Yosemite v10.10.2

  Impact: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges

  Description: An off by one issue existed in IOAcceleratorFamily. This issue was addressed through improved bounds checking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-1066 : Ian Beer of Google Project Zero

* **IOSurface**

  Available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5 and OS X Mavericks v10.9.5

  Impact: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges

  Description: A type confusion issue existed in IOSurface's handling of serialized objects. The issue was addressed through additional type checking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-1061 : Ian Beer of Google Project Zero

* **Kernel**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10.2

  Impact: Maliciously crafted or compromised applications may be able to determine addresses in the kernel

  Description: The mach\_port\_kobject kernel interface leaked kernel addresses and heap permutation value, which may aid in bypassing address space layout randomization protection. This was addressed by disabling the mach\_port\_kobject interface in production configurations.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4496 : TaiG Jailbreak Team

* **Secure Transport**

  Available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, and OS X Yosemite v10.10.2

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept SSL/TLS connections

  Description: Secure Transport accepted short ephemeral RSA keys, usually used only in export-strength RSA cipher suites, on connections using full-strength RSA cipher suites. This issue, also known as FREAK, only affected connections to servers which support export-strength RSA cipher suites, and was addressed by removing support for ephemeral RSA keys.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-1067 : Benjamin Beurdouche, Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, Alfredo Pironti, and Jean Karim Zinzindohoue of Prosecco at Inria Paris
