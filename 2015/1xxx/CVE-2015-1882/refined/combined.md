CVSS String: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)*  **AFFECTED VERSIONS**: The following IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions are affected:- Version 8.5
- Version 8.5 Liberty Profile if you have installed the Portlet Container feature from the WASdev Liberty Repository.
- Version 8
- Version 7

 **Remediation/Fixes:** Remediation is needed for WebSphere Application Server as well as there may be a need for your own portlets to be updated to avoid this issue. The recommended solution is to apply the Fix Pack or PTF for each named product as soon as practical  ***Fix:***

Apply an [Interim Fix](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038178), [Fix Pack or PTF](https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980) containing this APAR PI17768 and/or PI30579, as noted below:  **For IBM WebSphere Application Server

For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.2 (Full Profile):**- Apply Fix Pack 3 (8.5.5.3), or later for fix to Portlet container for PI17768
- Apply Fix Pack 5 (8.5.5.5), or later for fix to Faces Portlet for PI30579

-- Or --- Apply Interim Fix for Faces Portlet [PI30579](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039435)
- Apply Interim Fix for Portlet Container [PI17768](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038178)

**For V8.5.0.0. through 8.5.5.2 (Liberty Profile):**  **If you have the installed the Portlet Container Feature from WASdev Liberty Repository:**- Remove the Portlet Container feature from your Liberty Profile server by deleting the following files and directories:

usr\extension\dev\api\spec\com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.portlet\_2.0.0.jar

usr\extension\dev\api\spec\com.ibm.ws.javaee.ccpp\_1.0.0.jar

usr\extension\dev\api\spec\com.ibm.ws.javaee.portlet\_2.0.0.jar

usr\extension\lib\com.ibm.ws.portletcontainer\_2.0.0.jar

usr\extension\lib\features\com.ibm.websphere.appserver.portlet-2.0.mf

usr\extension\lib\features\l10n\com.ibm.websphere.appserver.portlet-2.0.properties

usr\extension\lafiles\com.ibm.websphere.appserver.portlet-2.0 directory and all subdirectories

Then install the most current version of the Portlet Container from the WASdev Liberty Repository.

 **For V8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.9:**- Apply Fix Pack 10 (8.0.0.10), or later.

-- Or --- Apply Interim Fix for Faces Portlet [PI30579](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039435)
- Apply Interim Fix for Portlet Container [PI17768](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038178)

 **For V7.0.0.0 through 7.0.0.33:**- Apply Fix Pack 35 (7.0.0.35), or later.

-- Or --- Apply Interim Fix [PI17768](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038178)
- PI30579 is not applicable to version 7.0

 **Remediation for portlets:**

All JSR 286 compliant portlets that derive from class javax.portlet.GenericPortlet must override method serveResource.

An overriding serveResource implementation must not call super.serveResource.

If the portlet does not use resource serving, a empty implementation of serveResource should be used.

Example: This empty implementation is correct for a portlet that does not use resource serving:

@Override  **public**   **void**  serveResource(ResourceRequest request, ResourceResponse response) **throws**  PortletException, IOException {

   // Empty implementation on purpose

    if (logger.isLoggable(Level.WARNING) {

        // Unexpected call to serveResource, therefore log a warning.

        logger.log(Level.WARNING, "Unexpected call to serveResource.");

    }

}

Example of a WRONG fix:

@Override  **public**   **void**  serveResource(ResourceRequest request, ResourceResponse response) **throws**  PortletException, IOException {

   // **FIXME** This is wrong: Calling super.serveResource does not fix the security issue !  **super** .serveResource(request, response);
