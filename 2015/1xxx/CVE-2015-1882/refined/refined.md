Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a race condition in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile where the "run-as" user setting for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is not consistently honored in multi-threaded scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of user context in multi-threaded EJB execution.
- Failure to enforce the configured "run-as" user setting under concurrent access conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges on the system.
- The attacker could potentially execute code or access resources with permissions they should not have, leading to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to trigger EJB execution in a multi-threaded context
- The vulnerability is triggered in the Liberty Profile, specifically by making calls to EJBs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application server remotely.
- Some level of knowledge regarding EJB invocation and threading is likely required to exploit this vulnerability effectively.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.5, indicating a high severity.
- The vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile versions 8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.4.
- A fix is available in Fix Pack 5 (8.5.5.5) or later and also through Interim Fix [PI33357].
