Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `unity-settings-daemon` not properly detecting when the screen is locked. Specifically, it was relying on the `org.gnome.ScreenSaver` `ActiveChanged` signal, which is not emitted by Unity when the screen is locked or unlocked. This incorrect signal monitoring allowed removable media to be mounted even when the screen was locked, bypassing the intended security measure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrectly relying on the `org.gnome.ScreenSaver` signal for detecting screen lock status.
- Failure to monitor the `com.canonical.Unity.Session.Locked` signal, which is the correct signal to determine lock status in Unity.
- Vulnerable automount behavior that did not check for lock status.
- The vulnerability allows for the mounting of removable media while the screen is locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A local attacker could potentially insert a USB thumb drive while the screen is locked, and the system would attempt to mount it.
- If there is a vulnerability present in another component (such as an image library) used during the automount process, this could potentially give the attacker unauthorized access to the session.
- Attackers can bypass screen lock security by inserting a malicious USB drive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the machine.
- **Removable Media:** The attacker needs to be able to insert a USB or other removable media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Physical access to the Ubuntu system
- Ability to insert removable media
- An exploit for a vulnerability in another desktop component, such as an image library to gain unauthorized access.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 15.04 and 14.04 ESM.
- The fix involved the `unity-settings-daemon` to also monitor the `com.canonical.Unity.Session.Locked` signal to properly determine lock status.
- The fix was applied in `unity-settings-daemon` versions `15.04.1+15.04.20150408-0ubuntu1.2` for Ubuntu 15.04 and `14.04.0+14.04.20150825-0ubuntu2` for Ubuntu 14.04.
- A restart of the session is needed after the update for the changes to take effect.
-  The initial implementation intended to prevent exploitation of `nautilus thumbnailer vulnerabilities`, by disabling automount when the screen was locked.
