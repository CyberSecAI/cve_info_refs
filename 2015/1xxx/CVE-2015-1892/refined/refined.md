Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1892:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Multicast DNS (mDNS) implementations that improperly respond to unicast queries originating from outside the local network. This behavior can lead to information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS) amplification attacks.
*   While RFC 6762 doesn't explicitly prohibit responding to such unicast queries, it recommends ignoring them. Some implementations, however, do respond to these queries, which can be exploited.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the failure of vulnerable mDNS implementations to check the source address of unicast queries. They respond to queries from outside the local subnet, contrary to the recommended behavior outlined in RFC 6762.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Responding to external unicast queries can leak information about devices on the network, including device type, model, and operating system.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Amplification:** The size of the mDNS response is generally larger than the query. This makes it possible for attackers to amplify their attacks. By sending a small query to a vulnerable device, they can trigger a larger response to a victim, causing a DoS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain sensitive information about network devices and their configuration.
*   An attacker can launch amplified DoS attacks against other networks or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Attackers send unicast mDNS queries from outside the local network to vulnerable devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send unicast UDP packets to devices running vulnerable mDNS implementations. They do not need to be on the same local network as the vulnerable devices.

**Additional Information from the Documents**
* The vulnerability affects IBM Security Access Manager for Web 7.0 (appliance-based), and 8.0 firmware versions 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2, 8.0.0.4, 8.0.0.5, and 8.0.1.0.
* Patches are available for affected IBM Security Access Manager for Web products.
* The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Chad Seaman.
* Other vendors, including Avahi, Canon, and Hewlett-Packard, are also affected by this vulnerability in their products, though not all of the vendors respond the same way.

* The CERT vulnerability note (VU#550620) gives a more comprehensive description of the issue, and it is assigned a CVSS score, whereas the IBM advisory refers to the vulnerability by CVE.
