Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) failing to properly log off a user. This improper logoff leaves a session open, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate session termination: The AD FS logoff process does not fully invalidate the user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can gain access to a user's information by reopening an application from which the user has logged off, without needing to re-authenticate. The attacker can discover information to which the logged-off user had access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Reopening Application: The attacker reopens the application immediately after the legitimate user has logged off, exploiting the lingering session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to have the ability to access the application in the same browser immediately after the legitimate user has logged off. This implies the attacker likely needs to be on the same machine or have sufficient access to interact with the browser session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects AD FS 3.0 when installed on x64-based editions of Windows Server 2012 R2, including Server Core installations.
-  Microsoft stated they had no information to suggest that the vulnerability was publicly used to attack customers at the time the bulletin was issued.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified.
- The update addresses the issue by ensuring proper user logoff.
