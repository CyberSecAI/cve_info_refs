## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1271, CVE-2015-1270, CVE-2015-1272, CVE-2015-1273,
CVE-2015-1274, CVE-2015-1276, CVE-2015-1277, CVE-2015-1278, CVE-2015-1279,
CVE-2015-1281, CVE-2015-1282, CVE-2015-1283, CVE-2015-1284, CVE-2015-1285,
CVE-2015-1286, CVE-2015-1287, CVE-2015-1288, CVE-2015-1289, CVE-2015-5605)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 44.0.2403.89, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

## Issue [1226403008](/1226403008/): Merge to M44: Abort on OOM by default in FX\_Alloc(). (Closed)

| **Created:** 5 years, 5 months ago by [Lei Zhang](/user/Lei%20Zhang)  **Modified:** 5 years, 5 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Lei Zhang](/user/Lei%20Zhang)  **CC:** pdfium-reviews\_googlegroups.com  **Base URL:** https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium@2403  **Target Ref:** refs/heads/chromium/2403  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=76b563d2feed92ed328afb1f15e3466a9536b11b "Find reviews for the same repository ID - 76b563d2feed92ed328afb1f15e3466a9536b11b") | DescriptionMerge to M44: Abort on OOM by default in FX\_Alloc(). Add a FX\_TryAlloc() for those few cases where we might need to continue in face of OOM. Remove FX\_AllocNL() (the context of its use would suggest that NL means "No Limit"). This is used for some big allocations, so replace it with TryAlloc(). Large allocations may be worth trying to continue from, since there are few and they have a large chance of failing.
