{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The exploit chains three vulnerabilities: an authentication bypass, a directory traversal, and a privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass",
    "Directory traversal",
    "Privilege escalation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends HTTP POST requests to vulnerable endpoints, exploiting the authentication bypass to upload malicious files using directory traversal. The server then executes the uploaded payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager server. No prior authentication is needed due to the authentication bypass vulnerability."
