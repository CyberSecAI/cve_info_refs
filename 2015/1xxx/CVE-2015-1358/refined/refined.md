- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The remote management module of SIMATIC WinCC flexible panels and runtime transmits weakly protected credentials over the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers capturing network traffic could reconstruct user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by capturing network traffic of the remote management module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to capture network traffic and have a high level of skill to reconstruct the credentials.
