- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XSS, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to their records.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a cross-site scripting attack. The specific method is not provided, but XSS is generally achieved through malicious user input or by manipulating the application's data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into a location the victim's browser would execute, such as a vulnerable parameter.
