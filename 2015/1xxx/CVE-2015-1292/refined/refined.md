{
  "cveId": "CVE-2015-1292",
  "description": "The NavigatorServiceWorker::serviceWorker function in modules/serviceworkers/NavigatorServiceWorker.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy by accessing a Service Worker.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `NavigatorServiceWorker::serviceWorker` function within `modules/serviceworkers/NavigatorServiceWorker.cpp`. This function does not properly check the origin when accessing a service worker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-origin bypass",
      "Same Origin Policy violation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the Same Origin Policy, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data from different origins.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A crafted web page with malicious JavaScript can access a service worker from a different origin."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject malicious JavaScript into a web page that a user will visit with a vulnerable version of the browser. No user interaction is required besides visiting a web page.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is present in the Blink rendering engine, specifically in the implementation of service workers. The fix involves adding a cross-origin access check to the `navigator.serviceWorker` functionality. This prevents a web page from accessing service workers from different origins, which is a critical security measure to protect user data."
