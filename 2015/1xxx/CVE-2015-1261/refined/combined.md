# CVE-2015-1258

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1257.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1259.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1258 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1258)

#### Description

Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 relies on libvpx code that was not built with an appropriate --size-limit value, which allows remote attackers to trigger a negative value for a size field, and consequently cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted frame size in VP9 video data.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/05/stable-channel-update_19.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, May 19, 2015

The Chrome team is happy to announce the promotion of Chrome 43 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 43.0.2357.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements.  A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/42.0.2311.0..43.0.2357.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M43&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[489518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489518)] CVE-2015-1265: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.3 branch (currently 4.3.61.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Using your test example: "Düsseldorf" becomes "Düsseldorf", but "Düsseldorf, Germany" becomes "D%C3%BCsseldorf,%20Germany".  If you don't have a reason to encode the 'ü' in the former example, you should not encode the 'ü' in the latter either.  (At the very least, you should include both the "Düsseldorf" and "Düsseldorf, Germany" examples in the tests, so it's clear what the behaviour is.)  If your new plan is essentially to only consider spaces to be a problem, then I think you should just encode the space characters. That makes it hard to use Uri.encode (since it requires a whitelist, not a blacklist), but since you are prepared to manually iterate over the string, you could just call Uri.encode on just the characters you identify as spaces, and then put them back together. ```     | **tsergeant** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java File chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java#newcode312 chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java:312: \* Percent-encodes a URL fragment if it contains suspicious ... | | --- | | 5 years, 9 months ago (2015-03-25 01:55:24 UTC) [#8](#msg8) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java) File chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1011383005/diff/60001/chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java#newcode312) chrome/android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java:312: * Percent-encodes a URL fragment if it contains suspicious unicode whitespace characters.
