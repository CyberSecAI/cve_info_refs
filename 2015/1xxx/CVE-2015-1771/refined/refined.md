Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-1771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to improper management of user sessions within Microsoft Exchange web applications. This relates to how the application handles authentication and authorization of user actions, specifically when processing requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF):** The vulnerability is explicitly identified as a CSRF/XSRF issue. This means an attacker can trick a user's web browser into performing unwanted actions on a trusted site where the user is authenticated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform unauthorized actions on the web application, using the victim's identity.
- This includes reading content they should not have access to.
- They could modify permissions and delete content.
- Malicious content could be injected into the victim's browser.
- This could potentially lead to elevation of privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is web-based, typically involving a malicious webpage.
- Attackers would host this malicious webpage, or use a compromised website, containing a crafted request exploiting the vulnerability.
-  The attacker cannot force users to visit the webpage, but relies on social engineering tactics (email or instant messages) to entice the user to click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website where the malicious webpage can be placed.
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting the malicious site or clicking the malicious link while logged into the vulnerable Exchange server application.
- The user needs to be authenticated (logged in) to the target Exchange site for the CSRF attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Exchange web applications manage user session authentication.
- Microsoft was not aware of any public exploits of this vulnerability before the security bulletin was issued.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
