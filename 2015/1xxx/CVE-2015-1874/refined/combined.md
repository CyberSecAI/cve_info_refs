## Advisory:

# CSRF in Contact Form DB allows attacker to delete all stored form submissions

## Vulnerability

Last revised: February 17, 2015

An attacker able to convince a logged in admin user to follow a link (for instance via spearphishing) will be able to cause all records stored by this plugin to be removed.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 4.3 Medium | |

  <input name="all" type="text" value="y">
  <input name="delete" type="text" value="y">
