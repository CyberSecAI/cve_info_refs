Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to properly escape user input within the SQL context in the TYPO3 extension "Content Rating Extbase". This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, stemming from insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially:
    -  Read sensitive data from the database.
    -  Modify or delete data in the database.
    -  Potentially gain control over the application/server depending on database permissions and configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the TYPO3 CMS, specifically interacting with the vulnerable "Content Rating Extbase" extension.
- An attacker would inject malicious SQL code through user-controlled input fields processed by the extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the TYPO3 CMS application where the vulnerable extension is installed.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to identify input fields that are processed by the vulnerable extension and craft SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable extension is a third-party extension, and not part of the TYPO3 default installation.
- The affected versions of the extension are 2.0.3 and all versions below.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "High".
- No security fix was provided by the extension author, and users are advised to uninstall and delete the vulnerable extension.
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Steffen MÃ¼ller.
