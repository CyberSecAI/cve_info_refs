- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DukaPress plugin for WordPress fails to sanitize user input passed through the `$_GET['id']` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database or manipulate data by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by crafting malicious input for the `id` parameter in the `download.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be logged into WordPress to exploit the vulnerability. They can access the vulnerable endpoint directly.
