Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000005:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `downloadpdffile.php` file in the "candidate-application-form" WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`fileName` and `fileUrl` parameters), which allows for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The plugin directly uses the `fileName` and `fileUrl` GET parameters to construct the file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate to parent directories and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers can download any file accessible to the web server, potentially including sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), configuration files, and other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `downloadpdffile.php` script, including the `fileName` and `fileUrl` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `downloadpdffile.php` script relative to the web server's document root.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit code shows an example of downloading `/etc/passwd` by using `../../` to traverse up the directory tree.
- The advisory notes that the `fileUrl` parameter is not used, but its presence in the code could also potentially be exploited.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin directory.
- The vulnerable code is found within the `downloadpdffile.php` file of the plugin and the vulnerability resides in lines 2-4 and 16.
