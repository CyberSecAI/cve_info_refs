Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `download.php` file within the `filedownload` WordPress plugin not properly validating user input before using it to construct a URL for a file download. Specifically, the plugin doesn't check if a user is logged in or if the requested URL is external before allowing a download, leading to an open proxy vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Proxy:** The plugin allows users to specify an external URL, and the plugin will fetch and serve the content from that URL. This turns the plugin into an open proxy, where any arbitrary website can be requested by going through the wordpress plugin. The code checks for "http://" but doesn't validate it properly allowing for external URLs to be requested.
    
*   **Input Validation Failure:** The code does some basic filtering (checking for relative paths, `..`, and `.php` in the path) but it does not restrict external URLs when it should.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Delivery:** Attackers can use the vulnerable plugin to load and deliver malicious content to users' browsers by specifying a malicious URL.
*   **Masked Attacks:** Attackers can mask application-level attacks directed at a target site by routing their requests through the vulnerable WordPress plugin site, making it appear as if the traffic originated from the compromised plugin.
*   **Bypass Security Controls:** By acting as an open proxy, the plugin bypasses some security controls, such as firewalls that would usually restrict traffic from external sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable `download.php` file and supply an arbitrary external URL via the `path` parameter in the GET request. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Publicly Accessible Plugin:** The attacker needs to find a website running the vulnerable version of the `filedownload` plugin.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker only needs to be able to make an HTTP request to the vulnerable `download.php` script.

**CVE IDs:**

The advisory lists multiple CVE IDs. It appears that CVE-2015-1000002 specifically refers to the open proxy vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content also mentions potential SQL injection and persistent XSS (CVE-2015-1000003) and reflected XSS (CVE-2015-1000004), but these are separate issues and not relevant for CVE-2015-1000002.
* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the open proxy vulnerability using a simple curl command.
