Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000012:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an insecure implementation in the `downloadpage.php` file of the MyPixs WordPress plugin. The script directly includes a file specified by the `url` parameter from the HTTP request without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files on the server. This is due to the lack of input sanitization on the `url` parameter.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The plugin does not validate or sanitize the `url` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any local file path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, system files, and other private data. While the report indicates that RCE was not achieved, the LFI alone can lead to significant data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to `downloadpage.php`, with the `url` parameter containing the path to the desired local file to include.
  - Example URL: `http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/mypixs/mypixs/downloadpage.php?url=/etc/passwd`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site. They do not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable plugin directory which is typically in `wp-content/plugins/`
- The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable file `downloadpage.php` within the plugin.
