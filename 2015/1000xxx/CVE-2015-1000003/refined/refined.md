Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000003:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `download.php` file in the filedownload WordPress plugin not properly validating user-supplied input for the `path` parameter. Specifically, it does not check if a user is logged in before allowing a request to an external site. This lack of authentication allows the plugin to be abused as an open proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Open Proxy:** The primary weakness is the plugin's ability to fetch content from arbitrary URLs specified by the user through the `path` parameter without authentication.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin attempts to prevent relative paths and php files, but doesn't perform adequate sanitization of the `path` parameter and fails to enforce any authentication. It does check to see if the site allows external downloads but, if that is set to "allow" the plugin will allow any external url.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers can load malicious code into a victim's browser by directing the plugin to retrieve and serve the malicious content.
*   **Application Attacks:** The plugin can be used to mask attacks directed at a target site, making it appear as if the requests originate from the vulnerable WordPress site, thereby hindering proper identification of the attacker.
*  **Data Exfiltration:** The plugin could potentially be used to proxy requests to internal resources, potentially exfiltrating data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script, including the `path` parameter with the target URL. Example: `http://www.vapidlabs.com/wp-content/plugins/filedownload/download.php?path=http://www.google.com`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions other related vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-1000002 (related to directory traversal) and CVE-2015-1000004 (related to reflected XSS).
* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use the plugin as an open proxy by using an external URL in the path parameter.
* The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from WordPress.org.
