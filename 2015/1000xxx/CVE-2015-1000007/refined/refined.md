Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ajax_load.php` file within the `wptf-image-gallery` plugin. This file directly uses user-supplied input from the `url` parameter without proper sanitization or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate or sanitize the `url` parameter passed to `ajax_load.php`.
*   **Missing Authorization:** There is no check to ensure that only authorized users can access and download files using this script.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The script uses `file_get_contents()` to retrieve the content of the URL provided and returns it to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site. This includes sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, and other critical data.
*   **Information Leakage:** The downloaded files can expose confidential information, system details, and potentially credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a GET request to `ajax_load.php` with the `url` parameter set to the path of the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to send the malicious HTTP GET request.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code in `ajax_load.php` is:

```php
<?php
error_reporting(0);
$homepage = file_get_contents($_GET['url']);
$homepage = str_replace("script", "mboxdisablescript", $homepage);
$homepage = str_replace("SCRIPT", "mboxdisablescript", $homepage);
echo $homepage;
?>
```

The exploit is demonstrated using a `curl` command:

```bash
curl http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/wptf-image-gallery/lib-mbox/ajax_load.php?url=/etc/passwd
```

This command would attempt to download the `/etc/passwd` file from the server if the plugin is installed and vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

* The plugin was closed on November 20, 2013, and is no longer available for download.
* The vulnerability was reported on July 17, 2015.
* The vendor was notified on August 10, 2015.
* The provided content clearly indicates the vulnerability and its exploitation, going beyond the basic CVE description which only mentions "PLACEHOLDER".
