Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-1000006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `download-file.php` script in the "recent-backups" WordPress plugin does not perform sufficient access control and input sanitization. Specifically, it fails to verify if the user is logged in and does not sanitize the `file_link` parameter before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The plugin directly uses the `$_GET['file_link']` parameter to specify the file to be downloaded without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, including sensitive system files outside of the intended backup directory.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `download-file.php` script does not check if the user is authenticated or authorized to download files. This means any unauthenticated user can access the script and exploit the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd` or configuration files. This can lead to information disclosure, potentially revealing usernames, passwords, and other critical data.
*   **Compromise of System/Website:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further attacks on the server or website, potentially resulting in complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the `download-file.php` script with the `file_link` parameter containing a path to the file they want to download.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be a registered user or have any special privileges on the WordPress site. They can exploit this vulnerability without any prior authentication.
