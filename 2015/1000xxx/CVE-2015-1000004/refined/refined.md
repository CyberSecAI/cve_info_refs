Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-1000004, as detailed in the VapidLabs advisory:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Open Proxy (CVE-2015-1000004):** The `download.php` script in the filedownload plugin lacks proper checks to ensure a user is logged in and does not validate the target of the download, allowing requests to arbitrary external sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Proxy:** The plugin allows users to specify an external URL as the download source without any authentication or proper validation, effectively turning the plugin into an open proxy. This is the primary vulnerability for CVE-2015-1000004.
*   **Reflected XSS (CVE-2015-1000004):** The `download.php` script reflects the value of the `referer` parameter back to the user without sanitization, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Potential Persistent XSS/Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-1000003):** The plugin uses user-provided filenames in a SQL query without proper sanitization. This could potentially lead to a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability and Persistent XSS via the database if an attacker injects malicious code in the filename. However, the advisory mentions that exploitation of this vulnerability was not successful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Open Proxy:**
    *   An attacker can use a vulnerable WordPress site to proxy requests to other websites, hiding their origin and potentially evading network security measures.
    *   Malicious code could be loaded into a user's browser via the vulnerable plugin.
    *   The open proxy can mask application attacks directed at target sites.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the user's browser when they visit a specially crafted link, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Persistent XSS/Blind SQL Injection:** If successfully exploited, an attacker could inject malicious code into the database through filenames and execute it in the context of the affected site (Persistent XSS). The blind SQL injection vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data access/manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Open Proxy:** By sending a request to the `download.php` script with a `path` parameter pointing to an external URL, the attacker can use the plugin as a proxy.
*   **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a URL with a malicious `referer` parameter, an attacker can inject JavaScript into the user's browser when they visit that URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Open Proxy:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site with the `filedownload` plugin installed and enabled.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable WordPress site and then trick a user into clicking that link.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text includes additional information about CVE-2015-1000002 and CVE-2015-1000003, which are related to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting. These have been included in the analysis above.
*   The advisory mentions the plugin has been closed as of November 15, 2015 and is not available for download.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates the open proxy and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Summary of CVE-2015-1000004 (Open Proxy & XSS):**
The core issue for CVE-2015-1000004 is the lack of input validation and authentication checks in the `download.php` script within the filedownload WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows users to download files from arbitrary external URLs by exploiting the `path` parameter, effectively creating an open proxy. Furthermore, the script reflects the value of the `referer` parameter back to the user without any sanitization, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.
