Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `download.php` file within the MP3-jPlayer WordPress plugin. Specifically, the code in this file discloses sensitive path information due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input. The vulnerability resides in how the `$info` variable is constructed, specifically lines 120-128, which includes the absolute server path `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` and the constructed path to the file being requested.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is path disclosure. The plugin reveals the full server path to the requested files when downloading, due to the construction of the $info variable which is then echoed back to the user.
- **Information Leakage:** The code leaks sensitive information, including the server's document root, which can be used to construct additional attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Gathering:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, including the location of the WordPress installation and other sensitive files. This information can be used in future attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a simple HTTP GET request to the `download.php` file with a specifically crafted `mp3` parameter such as `mp3=.`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
- **No Authentication Required**: No prior authentication is required for the exploitation. Any user can send a request to the affected endpoint to get the path disclosed.
