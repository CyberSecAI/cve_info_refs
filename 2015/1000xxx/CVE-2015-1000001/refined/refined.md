Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-1000001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of authorization checks in the `fast-image-adder-uploader.php` file of the Fast Image Adder WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin doesn't verify if a user has the necessary permissions to upload files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows any user (authenticated or not) to upload files to the WordPress uploads directory.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The `fast-image-adder-uploader.php` script does not check for user authentication or authorization before processing file uploads.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin uses the `file_get_contents` function to fetch content from a URL, and `file_put_contents` to save it, without proper validation or sanitization of the content or the filename. This can be exploited to upload arbitrary files to the server, and the user is notified of the location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any type of file, including malicious PHP scripts, to the WordPress server.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP shell, an attacker can gain remote code execution capabilities on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress site, including data theft, defacement, or further attacks on the network.
- **Server Takeover:** Ultimately, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to take control of the entire web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a direct HTTP request to the `fast-image-adder-uploader.php` file with a malicious URL as a parameter.
- **URL parameter:** The attack requires the attacker to supply the vulnerable script with a URL to download, and this URL may point to a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the Fast Image Adder plugin is installed and vulnerable.
- **Remote file location:** The attacker must have a remotely hosted file available to upload to the target server. The remote file must be available as a download and not be parsed as PHP on the host.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed and is not available for download since February 26, 2018.
- The advisory from vapidlabs.com provides detailed technical information and exploit code.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-434, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.
- The plugin generates a random filename, but this does not prevent the vulnerability because the full path is reported back to the attacker.
