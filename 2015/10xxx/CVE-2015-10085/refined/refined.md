Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `b91aa4674d460993765884e8463c70e6d886bc90`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the SMTP server was handling incoming commands and data. Specifically, it was vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by not properly limiting the length of incoming lines. An attacker could send extremely long lines without a newline character, which would cause the server to consume resources trying to read this oversized input. The fix was to use a `ReadUntill` function which limits the input size to `MAX_CMD_LINE` which is set to 512 bytes, according to RFC standards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of input validation/limit:** The original code did not enforce a maximum line length when reading commands from the client.
- **Infinite read:** Without a limit, the server could potentially get stuck in a read loop, consuming resources until it crashes or becomes unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send excessively long lines, causing the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service by making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Resource exhaustion:** The server's memory or CPU could be exhausted due to the continuous processing of large input lines.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker needs to send crafted SMTP commands over the network.
- **Specifically crafted input:** The attacker sends a single very long line without a newline character to the SMTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the SMTP server on port 25.
- The attacker can send data to the server via this connection.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves introducing a `ReadUntill` function that limits the number of bytes read from the input stream when reading commands.
- The `parser.go` file was modified to include the `ReadUntill` function and utilize `MAX_CMD_LINE`
- Added new tests to `datareader_test.go` to verify the proper behaviour of data reading.
- Added code to `mta.go` to handle long lines.
