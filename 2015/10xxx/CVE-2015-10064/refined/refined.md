The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10064.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs before they are used in SQL queries. Specifically, the code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability. The code directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially compromising the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
   - Read sensitive data from the database.
   - Modify or delete data in the database.
   - Execute arbitrary SQL queries, possibly leading to further system compromise.
   - Bypass authentication mechanisms

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the application's web interface, where user input is accepted in the following files: `addStrike.php`, `editStrike.php`, `golpes.php`, and `validateRegister.php`.
By injecting SQL code within parameters such as:
   - `$name`, `$damage` in `addStrike.php`
   - `$id`, `$name`, `$damage` in `editStrike.php`
   - `$a` in `golpes.php`
   - `$user`, `$email` in `validateRegister.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input through the application's web interface to inject SQL code. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject SQL via `golpes.php`.

**Mitigation:**
The provided content shows that the vulnerability was mitigated by implementing `mysql_real_escape_string()` to sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, which escapes special characters and prevents SQL injection.
