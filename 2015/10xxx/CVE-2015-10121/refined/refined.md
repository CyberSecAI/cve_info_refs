The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository for a WordPress plugin called "beeliked-microsite". The commit modifies how the plugin handles iframe resizing.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The original code uses the `iFrameResize` library with default settings, which includes origin checking. This prevents the plugin from working correctly when the iframe content is loaded from a different domain. The change modifies the `iFrameResize` settings to disable origin checking via the `checkOrigin: false` setting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Disabling origin checking in the `iFrameResize` library can introduce a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. By removing origin checks, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the iframe and execute it on the user's domain, since the plugin does not properly sanitize the `url` parameter before passing it to the iframe tag.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as stealing session cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker would need to control the `url` parameter of the `[BEELIKED_MICROSITE]` shortcode, typically via exploiting another vulnerability, or convincing an administrator to use a malicious url.
  - The attacker would then craft a malicious website with content designed to exploit the missing origin check.
  - When the victim visits the page with the exploited shortcode, their browser would load the malicious website into the iframe and execute the attacker's code in the context of the victim's domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the `url` parameter of the shortcode used by the plugin. This could be achieved via a vulnerability in the website using the plugin, or via social engineering.
