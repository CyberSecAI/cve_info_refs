The provided content is related to a commit that addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in a PHP application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was previously vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied string values into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through user-supplied input, leading to unauthorized access to the database, modification or deletion of data, or potentially other more severe impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject SQL code via the following:
- The `where` clause
- Inserted `values`
- `updated values`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to control or influence the data that's passed to the application's database interactions, which is typical in web applications when accepting user input and using it in database queries.

**Mitigation:**
The commit introduces a `sqlInjectionPrevent` function that uses `mysqli_real_escape_string` to escape potentially dangerous characters in string values before they are used in SQL queries. This function is applied to values passed to the where, insert, and update database functions, mitigating the SQL injection risks.
