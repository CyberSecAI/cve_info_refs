The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_login.php` file, where user input was directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This creates a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The code constructs an SQL query by directly concatenating user-provided input (`$user` and `$pass`) into the SQL string, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the `$user` and `$pass` variables, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` variables in the `_login.php` file. An attacker can send specially crafted values through these POST parameters to manipulate the SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP POST requests to the web application containing the vulnerable `_login.php` script. No special access to the system is required beforehand.

**Additional details:**
- The commit log shows the fix implemented for this vulnerability:
    - The vulnerable query: `$query = "SELECT user_name, class, person_id FROM users WHERE user_name = '$user' AND password = '$pass'";`
    - Was replaced with a parameterized query: `$query = "SELECT user_name, class, person_id FROM users WHERE user_name = :username AND password = :password";` and `oci_bind_by_name` to bind the parameters
- The `users.php` file has also been changed, removing a duplicate `input` tag with the name `q`.
