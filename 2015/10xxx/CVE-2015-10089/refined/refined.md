Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of user-supplied data when rendering content in various UI components. Specifically, the application was using `innerHTML` and `element.html` to insert potentially malicious HTML content without proper sanitization. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks in multiple places including:
    *   Checkbox labels in `CheckboxView`
    *   Menu item titles in `MenuView`
    *   Table cell content and titles in `TableDataView`
    *   Table headers in `TableView`
    *   Arbitrary strings within `string_measurement.js`

The application was directly inserting user provided strings into the HTML DOM without escaping potentially malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious user to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's browser.
*   Steal session cookies and impersonate the victim user.
*   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   Deface the website or display unauthorized content.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector would involve injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into data fields that are later rendered by the vulnerable UI components. This could be achieved through various means, such as:

*   Manipulating form inputs.
*   Modifying data stored in the database.
*   Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application to inject data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to inject or modify data that is displayed by the vulnerable UI components. This could require authentication and authorization depending on the application, and access to specific fields.
*   No special privileges are likely to be required in the application.

**Technical Details:**

The commit messages and code diffs highlight the following:

*   **`utils/string_measurement.js`**: The `innerHTML` call was modified to use Handlebars' `escapeExpression` to sanitize strings before insertion.
*   **`views/checkbox_view.js`**: The title of the checkbox was being directly inserted; this was changed to use `escapeExpression`.
*  **`views/menu_view.js`**:  The title of the menu was being assembled using string concatenation before being passed to `measureString`, which was then inserted into the DOM via innerHTML. This was changed to use an array of titles.
*   **`views/table_data_view.js`**: The read-only value of a table cell was being inserted without escaping, this was changed to use  `escapeExpression` for sanitization before insertion using `html`. Table cell content was also modified to escape strings using `escapeExpression` before insertion into the DOM via innerHTML.
*   **`views/table_view.js`**: The table's panel title was modified to use `escapeExpression`, as was the header label content, before insertion into the DOM via `innerHTML`.

In summary, the vulnerability was caused by lack of proper sanitization of user inputs before rendering to the DOM. This allowed for XSS injection at multiple locations. The fix involved escaping content using `Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression` prior to insertion.
