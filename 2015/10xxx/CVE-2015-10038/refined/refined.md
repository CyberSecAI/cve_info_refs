The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, showing changes made to address a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, the `$_POST` and `$_SESSION` variables were directly used in SQL queries without being escaped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection. The code used the `$_POST` variables and `$_SESSION` variables without escaping them, making them vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to:
- Data exfiltration: sensitive information from the database could be accessed.
- Data manipulation: data in the database could be modified or deleted.
- Full compromise of the application and/or database server

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL code injected in parameters such as 'c11' and 'req'.
- Session manipulation to inject malicious code in the `$_SESSION['user']` variable

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- User account with access to the vulnerable pages (or ability to manipulate the session).

**Mitigation:**
The commit introduces the use of `mysql_real_escape_string()` function to sanitize the inputs from `$_POST` and `$_SESSION['user']` before including them in SQL queries. This will prevent SQL injection attacks by escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL code.

**Additional notes:**
- The code uses the deprecated `mysql_*` functions which are no longer recommended. It would be better to use `mysqli_*` or PDO with prepared statements for better security.
- The commit message "Added fix for SQL Injection" further confirms that the changes are meant to address this particular vulnerability.
