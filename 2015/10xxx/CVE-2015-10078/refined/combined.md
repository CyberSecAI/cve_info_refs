### @sdunham **[sdunham](/sdunham)** commented [Apr 27, 2015](#issue-71364282)

The send\_welcome\_email\_url() function doesn't use esc\_url() on the output of add\_query\_arg(), which is the suggested fix for plugins which were affected by the [WP 4.1.2 Security Release.](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-1-2/) You do pass it to wp\_nonce\_url(), which uses esc\_html(). But this may not be enough to address the security issue.

See this post for details: <https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins.html>

Sorry, something went wrong.
