The provided content is a commit page from a GitHub repository for the "rt-prettyphoto" WordPress plugin. The commit message "xss fixed" and the file changes suggest this commit addresses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The commit message "xss fixed" and file changes in `js/jquery.prettyPhoto.js`, `readme.txt`, and `rt-prettyphoto.php` indicate that the vulnerability was an XSS issue likely due to unsanitized user input or data being reflected in the web page without proper encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to various attacks like session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting users to malicious sites, depending on the context and user privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through injecting malicious JavaScript code. This could be via vulnerable input fields, plugin configurations or parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject or control the data that is being displayed on the site through this vulnerable plugin.

This commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by sanitizing or encoding the output to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. While the specific details of the code changes are not included in this summary, the file changes and commit message are sufficient to determine the nature of the fix.
