Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified commit message "prevent sql injection":

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code used direct string concatenation to construct SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is evident in the code snippets like:

   ```php
   $results = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM `mirna` WHERE Name = '$new'");
   $total = $this->db->query("SELECT count(*) FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE '%$name%'");
   $total = $this->db->query("SELECT count(*) FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE '%$name%' AND tissue = '$tissue'");
    $results = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE '%$name%' ORDER BY databaseid ASC LIMIT $records_perpage OFFSET $c_p");
    $results = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE '%$name%' AND tissue = '$tissue' ORDER BY databaseid ASC LIMIT $records_perpage OFFSET $c_p");
   ```

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability was SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input being directly embedded into SQL queries. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the query to access or modify data they shouldn't be able to.
- The code was vulnerable because user provided values for $new, $name and $tissue were not sanitized and were directly included into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could also potentially alter or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues.
- **Authentication Bypass:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to authentication bypass if the application is not properly using prepared statements.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parameters `$new`, `$name`, and `$tissue` in the functions `select_single_rna`, `count_rna`, and `select_rnas`. Attackers could inject malicious SQL code within these parameters through web requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send web requests containing manipulated data for the `name`, `tissue` and `new` parameters.
- The attacker would need to have knowledge of how the SQL database and web application were configured.

**Mitigation:**
The code was patched by replacing the vulnerable queries with prepared statements using PDO, as shown in the following snippets:

```php
$results = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM `mirna` WHERE Name = ?");
$results->bindParam(1,$new);
$results->execute();

$total = $this->db->prepare("SELECT count(*) FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE ? AND Cancer_Effect LIKE ?");
$total->bindValue(1,"%" . $name . "%");
$total->bindValue(2,"%" . $onc . "%");
$total->execute();

$total = $this->db->prepare("SELECT count(*) FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE ? AND tissue = ? AND Cancer_Effect LIKE ?");
$total->bindValue(1,"%" . $name . "%");
$total->bindParam(2,$tissue);
$total->bindValue(3,"%" . $onc . "%");
$total->execute();

$results = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE ? AND Cancer_Effect LIKE ? ORDER BY databaseid ASC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?");
$results->bindValue(1,"%" . $name . "%");
$results->bindValue(2,"%" . $onc . "%");
$results->bindParam(3,$records_perpage,PDO::PARAM_INT);
$results->bindParam(4,$c_p,PDO::PARAM_INT);
$results->execute();

$results = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM mirna WHERE Name LIKE ? AND tissue = ? AND Cancer_Effect LIKE ? ORDER BY databaseid ASC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?");
$results->bindValue(1,"%" . $name . "%");
$total->bindParam(2,$tissue);
$results->bindValue(3,"%" . $onc . "%");
$results->bindParam(4,$records_perpage,PDO::PARAM_INT);
$results->bindParam(5,$c_p,PDO::PARAM_INT);
$results->execute();
```
By using prepared statements and parameter binding, the application prevents SQL injection by ensuring that user-provided data is treated as data, not executable code, in the SQL queries. This significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.
