Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The commit message "Fixed for sql injection" and the code diff indicate the root cause is a vulnerability to SQL injection in the `custom_import.pl` script. Specifically, the script was vulnerable to SQL injection through unsanitized input. The code diff shows the addition of checks to prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The original code lacked proper sanitization of input strings, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** An attacker could potentially inject SQL code to gain access to the underlying database, modify or delete data, or perform other unauthorized actions.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored in the database could be exposed or stolen.
*   **System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can even be used to gain control of the server hosting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input String:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious SQL commands into the input string `$str`. This input is read by the program and used in database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs the capability to supply the malicious input string to the vulnerable script. The code diff also suggests that this input string is provided by `$_`. The details of how `$_` obtains the input is not provided in the content.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax and the database structure to craft effective injection attacks.
*   **Ability to reach script:** An attacker needs to reach the script and trigger its execution.

**Additional Notes**
The provided code diff shows a fix that attempts to prevent SQL injection through simple keyword filtering (e.g. `drop table`, `select`), which is not a robust solution and may be bypassed with more complex SQL injection attacks. This is a patch, not a complete fix.
