The provided content relates to CVE-2015-10021.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was rendering unencoded HTML from the term's definition data, leading to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability due to rendering unencoded HTML from user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the term definitions, which would then be executed in the browsers of users viewing those definitions. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the term's definition data. An attacker could inject malicious HTML into a term definition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to add or modify term definitions. This might require being an authenticated user with appropriate permissions or exploiting another vulnerability to modify the data.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves encoding HTML tags (specifically `<` and `>`) in the database module before rendering it in the view.
- A new `sanitize.js` module was introduced to handle HTML encoding.
- The database module was updated to use the new `sanitize` module before returning data for display.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `b31a022ba4d8d17148445a13ebb5a42ad593dbaa`, and merged via pull request #51.
- The sanitization logic was later refactored due to the introduction of markdown support, moving the sanitization from the DB module to the client to allow flexibility in data usage by different clients.
