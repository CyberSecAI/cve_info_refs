This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix XSS on term-detailed web client view.

```
Previous behavior would render unencoded HTML in the view based on the term's definition-data.
New behavior encodes HTML-tags in the DB-module via a separate sanitize module.
However, be aware this functionality should be called prior to any markdown-related conversion in the future.
Otherwise, the resulting HTML will be encoded.
Related to [#49](https://github.com/ritterim/definely/issues/49).

Also added a new gulp task for running TDD-style tests.
And, incorporated this into the existing test-task.
```

### @billbogaiv **[billbogaiv](/billbogaiv)** commented [Jan 24, 2015](#issue-55360349)

Previous behavior would render unencoded HTML in the view based on the term's definition-data.

New behavior encodes HTML-tags in the DB-module via a separate sanitize module.

However, be aware this functionality should be called prior to any markdown-related conversion in the future.

Otherwise, the resulting HTML will be encoded.

Related to [#49](https://github.com/ritterim/definely/issues/49).

Also added a new gulp task for running TDD-style tests.

And, incorporated this into the existing test-task.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Don't know why there were two `test` tasks. This one will never execute. [@allenbrubaker](https://github.com/allenbrubaker), any ideas?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Due to the introduction of [#54](https://github.com/ritterim/definely/issues/54), doing the conversion in the DB-module doesn't feel like the best place for sanitizing HTML-output. This has an impact on API-calls too, which may want to preserve the original data-format. Ultimately, it should be up to the client to determine what to do what the data. Therefore, the aforementioned PR will contain refactoring of this logic. |
