The provided content is related to a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `klear-library` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how user-supplied input is processed within the `_prepareAdvancedCondition` method, specifically within the `case 'between'`, `case 'notin'`, and `case 'in'` blocks. The code was directly concatenating user-provided values into the SQL query without proper sanitization. While other cases use `quoteInto`, these cases use `implode` which does not escape the values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `_prepareAdvancedCondition` method uses `implode` to concatenate values from user input, which are then directly inserted into the SQL query. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code within these values, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete existing data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database or application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By injecting malicious SQL code through the `between`, `in`, or `notin` conditions of the search parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application that utilizes the vulnerable code and be able to control the search parameter's value.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily require prior authentication, this vulnerability could be exploited in anonymous requests if the search functionality is available to unauthorized users.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit message mentions "Fix sql injection".
- The code diff shows changes in the `_prepareAdvancedCondition` method. Notably, the cases for `between`, `notin`, and `in` now use `quoteInto` to prevent sql injection.
- The original code used `implode` without proper escaping of values which resulted in the vulnerability.
