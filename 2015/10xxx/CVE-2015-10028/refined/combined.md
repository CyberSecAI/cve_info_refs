Before there was no protection stopping users from submitting their own HTML including JavaScript functions. This could allow attackers to steal sensitive information like session cookies, or just to deface the page by changing page-wide CSS rules.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| wow, thanks man!  I must say, since we developed this project only for a hackathon, we didn't think about security at all, there are probably a few other problems we probably have with the application, but thanks for sending this PR. |
