The provided content is related to a commit that fixes SQL injection vulnerabilities, which aligns with the intent of CVE-2015-10034, though a specific CVE is not mentioned. The commit message explicitly states "Fixed building queries - preventing SQL-injection".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application was constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Unsanitized user input was being directly embedded into SQL queries. This allowed an attacker to potentially execute malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database (e.g. user credentials, personal information)
    - Modify or delete data in the database
    - Potentially gain complete control of the database server

**Attack vectors:**
-  The primary attack vector would be through any user-controlled input fields that are used to build SQL queries. This commit specifically targets the following areas:
  - Rating exercises.
  - Retrieving the best exercise result for a user.
  - Rating gyms

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious input through the application's user interface.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerabilities, aside from being a user of the application.

**Details from code changes:**

- The commit replaces the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries with `PreparedStatement`.
- Placeholders (`?`) are used in the SQL query, and user-supplied data is passed as parameters to the prepared statement. This mechanism prevents SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated as data and not as SQL commands.

- Examples of SQL injection fixes in the commit:
  - `ExerciseDao.java`:
     - **Vulnerable code:**
       ```java
       String sql = connection.nativeSQL("INSERT INTO exercise_ratings(user_id, exercise_id, rating) VALUES" + " (" + userId + ", " + exerciseId + ", " + rating + ");");
       connection.createStatement().execute(sql);
       ```
     - **Fixed code:**
       ```java
       PreparedStatement p = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO exercise_ratings(user_id, exercise_id, rating) VALUES (?, ?, ?);");
       p.setInt(1, userId);
       p.setInt(2, exerciseId);
       p.setInt(3, rating);
       p.executeQuery();
       ```
    -   `ExerciseDao.java`:
        - **Vulnerable Code:**
          ```java
          ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT weight, set_count, reps_per_set" + " FROM workout_entries" + " JOIN workouts USING (workout_id)" + " WHERE user_id = " + userId + " AND exercise_id = " + exerciseId + " ORDER BY weight" + " LIMIT 1;");
          ```
        -  **Fixed Code:**
          ```java
          PreparedStatement p = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT weight, set_count, reps_per_set" + "FROM workout_entries " + "JOIN workouts USING (workout_id) " + "WHERE user_id = ? AND exercise_id = ? " + "ORDER BY weight" + "LIMIT 1;");
          ResultSet resultSet = p.executeQuery();
          ```
   - `GymsDao.java`:
        - **Vulnerable Code:**
          ```java
          String sql = connection.nativeSQL("INSERT INTO gym_ratings(user_id, gym_id, rating) VALUES" + " (" + userId + ", " + gymId + ", " + rating + ");");
           connection.createStatement().execute(sql);
          ```
        - **Fixed Code:**
            ```java
            PreparedStatement p = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO gym_ratings(user_id, gym_id, rating) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
            p.setInt(1, userId);
            p.setInt(2, gymId);
            p.setInt(3, rating);
            p.executeQuery();
            ```
