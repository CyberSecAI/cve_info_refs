The provided content relates to CVE-2015-10030.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-provided directory names in the `dir()` method of the `Surpass.php` file. Specifically, the method did not prevent the use of `.` and `/` characters in directory names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Directory traversal vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to access or manipulate files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially read, write, or execute arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the directory name provided to the `dir()` method.

**Attack Vectors:**
By providing a directory name containing `..` sequences, the attacker could navigate to parent directories of the intended target, and potentially gain access to sensitive information or even execute malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to have the ability to provide directory names to the vulnerable `dir()` method, which is typically done through a user-controlled input. This could be an attacker directly interacting with the application, or indirectly through some other means.

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit `d22337d453a2a14194cdb02bf12cdf9d9f827aa7` shows the fix implemented for this vulnerability which involves replacing `.` and `/` from the directory name provided to the dir() method using `str_replace`.
