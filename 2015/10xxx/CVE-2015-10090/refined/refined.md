Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2015-10090:

**Verification:**
The commit message "Security patch for XSS" in the second content snippet directly indicates that this commit addresses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is not explicitly stated within the provided diffs. However, the commit message indicates the patch is for an XSS vulnerability. The changes to the code do not show any immediate vulnerabilities but do include changes to several different php files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The primary weakness is the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This suggests that user-supplied data was not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed on a web page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions such as:
    *   Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code into input fields or other data sources that are used by the application to generate web page content. This typically occurs by crafting special URLs or form data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious input into the application. This could be done in multiple ways including:
        *   Through a vulnerable input field on the landing page itself.
        *   By altering data within a database or file that the application reads.
    *   The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated, depending on how the XSS is triggered and where the malicious input can be injected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The diff from `classes/class.extend.php` modifies how template configurations and licensing keys are loaded and processed. It also includes changes that handle legacy data models by changing `options` to `settings`. While this diff is not directly related to the XSS vulnerability, it is a large part of the security patch commit.
*   The diff from `classes/class.statistics.php` has a minor change related to retrieving post meta data for variations in an A/B test.
* The commit includes a binary file addition for `codecept.phar`.
*  The commit has many changed files related to testing.
*   The provided content does not have sufficient information to determine the specific location in the code where the XSS vulnerability was located, or how it was corrected. It is clear that the commit was created to address this type of vulnerability.

In conclusion, the provided content is relevant to CVE-2015-10090, as it clearly references a security patch for XSS. The commit message indicates an effort to fix an XSS issue. The provided code diffs do not immediately reveal the exact nature of the XSS vulnerability or how it was patched but do give us an idea of the scope of changes.
