Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the TYPO3 extension "http:BL Blocking" (mh_httpbl) before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the extension was directly incorporating user-provided values for filtering and sorting within SQL `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input for parameters such as `block_ip`, `sort`, and `order`, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database.
- They could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- They could potentially disrupt the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET or POST parameters used by the backend module of the "http:BL Blocking" extension. An attacker would need access to the TYPO3 backend to exploit this.
- Specifically, the vulnerable parameters are:
    -  `block_ip` (for filtering)
    -  `sort` (for selecting the column to sort)
    -  `order` (for specifying sort order - ASC/DESC)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A valid backend login with permission to access the vulnerable module of the "http:BL Blocking" extension is required. This means the attacker must have some level of authorized access to the TYPO3 instance.

**Technical Details**
The provided diff from the commit `429f50f` shows the changes made to fix the SQL injection:
- Instead of directly using `t3lib_div::_GP('block_ip')` in the `WHERE` clause, the code now uses `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->fullQuoteStr()`. This function properly escapes the input to prevent SQL injection.
- Instead of directly using `t3lib_div::_GP('sort')` and `t3lib_div::_GP('order')` in the `ORDER BY` clause, the code now uses explicit value checks and a ternary operator to ensure the values are valid (`'tstamp', 'block_ip', 'block_type', 'block_score'` for `sort` and `ASC` or `DESC` for `order`)
- Similar fixes were also applied for the whitelist and statistics parts of the module.

The TYPO3 security advisory confirms the vulnerability and states that versions 1.1.7 and below are affected. It also indicates the severity as "High" and provides a CVSS score of AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C.

The advisory recommends uninstalling the extension as the author did not provide a fix in time.
