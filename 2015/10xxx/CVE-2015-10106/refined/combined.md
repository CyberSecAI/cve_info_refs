# SQL Injection in extension "http:BL Blocking" (mh\_httpbl)

It has been discovered that the extension "http:BL Blocking" (mh\_httpbl) is susceptible to SQL Injection.

**Release Date:** September 30, 2015

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:**  version 1.1.7 and below

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input, the extension is vulnerable to SQL Injection. A valid backend login with permission to access the backend module is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Solution:** Versions of this extension that are known to be vulnerable will no longer be available for download from the TYPO3 Extension Repository. The extension author failed in providing a security fix for the reported vulnerability in a decent amount of time. Please uninstall and delete the extension from your installation.

**Credits:** Credits go to Wouter van Dongen who discovered and reported the issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
