**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message "New version 1.3 fixing prettyPhoto XSS issue and video rendering" indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability within the prettyPhoto library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the prettyPhoto library, specifically related to how it handles user-provided content that might include JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Displaying deceptive content.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code through an input field that is rendered within the prettyPhoto modal.
- The injected code would then be executed when a user views the popup containing the malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need the ability to inject data into the plugin's settings, which would then be rendered on the front end. This could potentially involve exploiting a separate vulnerability or through gaining admin access.

**Additional Notes**
