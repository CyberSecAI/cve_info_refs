…tasy commands.

This commit replaces \r\n with '.  ' in tweets.

An edge-case issue where you may be able to exploit the bot having op.
Should you be the one being tracked, you could insert a newline in your tweet, and follow it up for "!ban <someone>" to execute a fantasy command.

This exploit requires a lot of requirements to be met. Mainly the fact that the bot has permissions in the channel, and that the followed person is associated and aware of the possibility.
