Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a SQL injection vulnerability and removes unnecessary code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code used string concatenation to build SQL queries, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `application/models/review_model.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or deletion, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input injected through user-controlled fields, specifically in the review functionality.
- An attacker could manipulate parameters like `$skill_value`, `$message`, and `$reviewid` in the `create`, `update` and `comment` functions to inject SQL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to submit user input that is used in the construction of SQL queries.
- Knowledge of the database structure to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Mitigation:**
- The commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerability by using prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of directly embedding user inputs into the SQL query string. This change is visible in the `application/models/review_model.php` file where queries are modified to use placeholders (e.g., `?`) and bound parameters.

**Code changes:**
- Several changes to the `application/models/review_model.php` file replace string concatenation with parameterized queries for the `create`, `update` and `comment` functions.
- The files `application/controllers/review.php`, `application/controllers/summoner.php`, and `application/libraries/Recent_games.php` also contain minor changes, mostly adding or removing code.

In summary, the main vulnerability is SQL injection in `application/models/review_model.php`, which is fixed in the provided commit using parameterized queries.
