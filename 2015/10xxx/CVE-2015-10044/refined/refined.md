Based on the provided content, the commit `76db54e9073b5248b8863e71a63d66a32d567d21` in the `gophergala/sqldump` repository addresses a SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application was using `?` as a placeholder for table names in SQL queries, which is not a valid way to prevent SQL injection. Instead, it was directly concatenating the table name into the query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. Specifically, the `dumptable` and `dumprecord` functions in `dump.go` were vulnerable. The application was taking the table name from user input and directly concatenating it into the SQL query, i.e., `conn.Prepare("select * from " + table)`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the table parameter.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the table parameter provided in the URL when calling `dumptable` or `dumprecord` function.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and manipulate the URL parameters, specifically the table name. They also need some understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload.

The fix replaces the vulnerable query construction with `conn.Prepare("select * from " + template.HTMLEscapeString(table))`. The `HTMLEscapeString` function escapes the table name, preventing SQL injection.
