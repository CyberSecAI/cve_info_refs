Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause is the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries, rather than using parameterized queries or prepared statements. This is evident in the original code of `HeatMapServlet.java` and `LoginServlet.java`. User-supplied inputs (like `city`, `category`, and `username`/`email`) were directly embedded into the SQL query strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection. Attackers could inject malicious SQL code through the input fields (`city`, `category`, `username`, `email`) and potentially manipulate the database, bypass authentication, or extract sensitive data.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate user input before including it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, business information, or other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker might modify or delete existing data in the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass the application's authentication mechanisms by manipulating the SQL queries.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker might execute complex or resource-intensive queries that could slow down or crash the database server or the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code via HTTP requests through vulnerable parameters, such as:
    *   `city` and `category` in the `HeatMapServlet`.
    *   `username` and `email` in the `LoginServlet`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and the structure of the underlying database.

**Code Changes:**

The commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerability by implementing prepared statements to parameterize the queries. Specifically:

*   **`OracleDBWrapper.java`:**
    *   A new `executeValidateQuery` method was added to handle parameterized queries using `PreparedStatement`.

*   **`AddAppUser.java`**:
    *   Modified the constructor to accept an ArrayList of parameters.
    *   The `addUser` method now calls `executeValidateQuery` instead of `executeQuery`

*   **`HeatMapServlet.java`**:
    *   No changes were made to this file; it still uses string concatenation which is concerning

*    **`LoginServlet.java`**:
    *   Modified the login query to use `?` placeholders and parameters
    *   Modified the signup query to use `?` placeholders and parameters

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit shows changes to how queries are made, but there are still vulnerabilities left in `HeatMapServlet.java`.
*   The use of `LIKE` in queries might also be a performance consideration and potential vulnerability point (depending on the database engine)
*   The `OracleDBWrapper` class does not close the `PreparedStatement` after execution which could lead to a resource leak, it is only closed on the `closeConnection()` method.
*   Error handling is minimal; Exceptions are only printed to standard output, this can provide an attacker with information about the database and its structure.

In summary, while the commit attempts to address SQL injection vulnerabilities by introducing prepared statements in some classes, the application remains vulnerable.
