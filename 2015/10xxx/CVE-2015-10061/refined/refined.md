The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository. It shows changes made to `ClienteDAO.java` and `BancoDeDados.sql`. The commit message indicates that the changes were made to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and to perform case-insensitive searches.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code used string concatenation to build SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `ClienteDAO.java` file initially constructs SQL queries by concatenating strings with user-provided input, specifically in the `buscarFuncionarioNome`, `buscarFuncionarioCPF`, `buscarFuncionarioEmail`, `buscarClienteNome`, `buscarClienteCPF`, and `buscarClienteEmail` methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the input fields, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, or even taking control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the input parameters of the `buscarFuncionario` and `buscarCliente` methods. By injecting SQL code within these parameters, an attacker could alter the intended query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to input data into the application through parameters used by the vulnerable methods.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**

The commit fixes the SQL injection vulnerability by:
1.  Replacing string concatenation with `PreparedStatement` and using `setString` method which properly escapes and sanitizes inputs.
2.  Replacing `like` with `ilike` to perform case-insensitive searches.

The commit also includes a minor change in `BancoDeDados.sql` to add semicolons after table creation statements.
