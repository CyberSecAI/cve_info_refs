The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10081.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issue in the `edit_list.php` file of the `submitByMailPlugin` for phpList.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `edit_list.php` file was missing CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially make unauthorized modifications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to manipulate the list settings, which might lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious link or website that triggers a request to the `edit_list.php` without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into making a request to `edit_list.php` while they are authenticated. This can be achieved through a malicious link, a compromised website, or by other social engineering techniques.
