Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2015-10039:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `EntityFactory.cs` file in the `Complex.Domino.Lib` library was vulnerable to SQL injection through the `orderBy` parameter in the `Find` method.

**Weakness:** The code directly uses the user-supplied `orderBy` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker could manipulate the `orderBy` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or other malicious activities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to control the `orderBy` parameter passed to the `Find` method of the `EntityFactory` class. This parameter is used to specify the order of results.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

* **Read sensitive data:** Access information they are not supposed to see by injecting SQL queries to extract data from the database.
* **Modify data:** Change, add or delete records within the database.
* **Compromise the database:** Execute arbitrary commands or cause denial of service by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Mitigation:** The commit `16f039073709a21a76526110d773a6cce0ce753a` addresses the SQL injection vulnerability. The fix introduces a regular expression validation of the `orderBy` parameter, restricting the allowed input to avoid the SQL injection. This regular expression check ensures that the `orderBy` string consists only of lowercase characters followed by an optional `asc` or `desc` and prevents injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Additional Details:**
* The commit message "Validate order by to prevent SQL injection" confirms that this was the primary goal of the commit.
* The code diff for `EntityFactory.cs` shows that the following lines were added:
  ```csharp
   if (!OrderByRegex.Match(orderBy).Success)
      {
        Error.AccessDenied();
      }
  ```
This code snippet validates the `orderBy` input string against the `OrderByRegex` which has been defined as:
`private static readonly Regex OrderByRegex = new Regex(@"[a-z]+\s\*(asc|desc){0,1}", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Compiled);`

This regex will match only strings that are composed of one or more lowercase characters and optionally followed by "asc" or "desc" separated by zero or more whitespaces. This effectively prevents the injection of arbitrary SQL.

The other code change is unrelated to this vulnerability.
