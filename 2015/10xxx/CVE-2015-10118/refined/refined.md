The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10118.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message explicitly states "Sanitising user input for protection. Avoiding XSS attacks". The code changes in `wp-copyprotect.php` show that the `sanitize_text_field()` function is now used to sanitize the `CopyProtect_nrc_text` option value before saving it. This indicates that there was a vulnerability related to unsanitized user input being saved and then potentially displayed, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `CopyProtect_nrc_text` option, which would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they viewed the affected pages. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
    - Defacing website content.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious javascript code through the plugin's configuration page where the `CopyProtect_nrc_text` option could be modified.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the capability to modify plugin settings. This typically means having admin access to the WordPress installation.
