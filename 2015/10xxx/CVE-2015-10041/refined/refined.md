The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10041.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `sendComments` function within the `site/procedures.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `text` input before being used in an SQL query. Specifically, the `text` variable was only escaped using `mysqli_real_escape_string`, which is insufficient to prevent all SQL injection attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database by injecting malicious SQL code within the comment text. This could result in:
  - Data Breaches: An attacker could steal sensitive information from the database.
  - Data Modification: An attacker could modify or delete existing data.
  - Privilege Escalation: In some cases, an attacker could gain access to higher privileges.
  - Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially disrupt the website by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing malicious SQL code through the comment text field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit comments on the affected web application. This likely requires being a logged-in user.
