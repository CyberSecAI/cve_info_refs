The content is related to CVE-2015-10023.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct SQL queries, which allows for SQL injection. The `vars["num"]` variable, which appears to be user-controlled, is directly interpolated into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The code uses string formatting to build SQL queries, leaving it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the `vars["num"]` variable contains malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the `vars["num"]` value. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, modification or deletion of data, or other malicious actions depending on database user's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- By modifying the `vars["num"]` variable, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `vars["num"]` variable. This may be through direct user input or indirectly through a different vulnerability that allows them to manipulate the variable.

**Additional details:**
- The commit diff shows that the vulnerable code using `fmt.Sprintf` for query construction was replaced by parameterized queries, which prevent SQL injection. This was done by using placeholders (`$1`) in the query and passing the value as a parameter in `db.QueryRow(query, vars["num"])`.
