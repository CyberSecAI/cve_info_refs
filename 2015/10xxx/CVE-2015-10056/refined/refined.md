The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the search functionality of the `recordstoreapp`. Specifically, the search query parameter `q` is used directly in an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query, without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, enabling them to retrieve, modify, or delete sensitive information stored within the database. This could include user data, record details, and more.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could insert, update or delete data, leading to data corruption and integrity issues.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to perform actions that could render the application unusable by injecting SQL commands that cause the database to crash or respond slowly.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `q` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the search functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have an understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- No specific position/privilege is needed for the attacker.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit diff shows that the vulnerability is fixed by using parameterized queries instead of concatenating the user input directly in the SQL query.
- The original code used the following code: `cursor.execute("SELECT id,title,artist,cover FROM recordstoreapp\_record WHERE title like '%" + q + "%' or artist like '%" + q + "%' or label like '%" + q + "%' or cat\_no like '%" + q + "%';")`
- The fix uses this code `cursor.execute("SELECT id,title,artist,cover FROM recordstoreapp\_record WHERE title like %s or artist like %s or label like %s or cat\_no like %s;", [q,q,q,q])`
- The commit message "fixed SQL injection vuln in unsanitized search input" also confirms this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code also performs some sanitization by removing `%` and `_` characters, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks, as many other malicious characters can be injected to manipulate the SQL queries.
