The provided content relates to CVE-2015-10102.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in the Freshdesk WordPress plugin, specifically in how it handles redirects to Freshdesk for single sign-on (SSO). The plugin was not properly validating the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect users to an arbitrary website.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The plugin's SSO implementation was vulnerable to open redirects because it was not adequately validating the target URL against configured domains before redirecting the user. The `fd_login` function was using user-supplied `host_url` parameter and redirecting to it after login. The `get_redirect_url` function was intended to perform validation against configured domains but did not fully protect against the open redirect.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked, would redirect the user to a site controlled by the attacker instead of Freshdesk.
- This can be used in phishing attacks to steal user credentials, install malware or perform other malicious actions by redirecting users to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a `host_url` parameter. This URL could be sent to victims through emails or other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect target as the `host_url` parameter and distribute it to the victim
- The victim needs to be a WordPress user with the Freshdesk plugin enabled.
