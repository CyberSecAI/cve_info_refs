Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `registerUser` function, specifically related to how user input (login) was being handled before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code was directly using user-provided login input in SQL queries without proper sanitization.  Specifically the `$login` variable was being escaped while the `$postLogin` was being used in the query, thus bypassing the attempted sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to the compromise of sensitive data, including user credentials, and other confidential information within the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also modify, insert, or delete data in the database.
- **Account takeover:** An attacker could create malicious users or modify permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Registration:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `registerUser` function, which is likely used during the user registration process.
- **Malicious Input:** By crafting a malicious login string that contains SQL injection payloads, an attacker could exploit the flaw when registering a new user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker would need to be familiar with SQL injection techniques and understand how to craft malicious SQL code.
- **Access to Registration Form:**  The attacker would need access to the user registration functionality of the application where they can provide input.
- **Ability to submit a malicious login:** The attacker needs the ability to submit a malicious login string to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is in `site/procedures.php`, Specifically this was the fix:

 	if (strlen($postLogin) < 3 or strlen($postLogin > 30))
 		$err[] = "Логин должен быть не меньше 3-х символов и не больше 30";
```

The vulnerability was caused by escaping the `$login` variable instead of `$postLogin` variable.  The fix is to escape the `$postLogin` variable.
