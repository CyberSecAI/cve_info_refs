The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the use of `add_query_arg` without proper sanitization in the `admin_screen_logic` function of the `wooframework-tweaks` plugin. The `add_query_arg` function was vulnerable to manipulation of query parameters when constructing redirect URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main weakness is the use of `add_query_arg` without sanitization, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the redirect URL by injecting malicious query parameters. This could be used to redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious locations.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a URL that includes malicious parameters that would be used by `add_query_arg` when generating the redirect, which is then executed by the `wp_safe_redirect` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with specific query parameters that are not sanitized, in order to cause a redirect to a malicious site.
