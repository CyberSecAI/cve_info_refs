Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the stated CVE:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message explicitly states "Parameterize queries to prevent against SQL injection". The code diff shows a change from directly embedding user-supplied data (specifically, the username from a cookie) into SQL queries to using prepared statements with bound parameters. The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsafe concatenation of the `$username` variable directly into the SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The original code used string concatenation to build SQL queries, including the `$username` obtained from a cookie. This made the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the cookie value to insert malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read or modify sensitive data in the database.
- **Account Compromise:** It might be possible to bypass authentication mechanisms or manipulate data related to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Cookie:** An attacker could intercept or modify the `user` cookie, injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to modify cookies:** The attacker must be able to set or manipulate the `user` cookie associated with the application. This could be achieved through techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks, malicious browser extensions, or direct manipulation if the attacker had access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Information:**
The provided commit diff highlights the following changes:

- In the `/feed` route, the SQL query:
  ```sql
  select redditor
  from followingRedditors
  where '$username' = userName
  ```
  is changed to:
  ```sql
  SELECT `redditor`
  FROM `followingRedditors`
  WHERE `userName` = :username
  ```
  along with the use of prepared statement `$statement->bindParam(':username', $username);`
- Similarly, in the `/subreddits` route, the SQL query:
  ```sql
  select subreddit
  from followingSubreddit
  where '$username' = userName
  ```
  is changed to:
  ```sql
  SELECT `subreddit`
  FROM `followingSubreddit`
  WHERE `userName` = :username
  ```
  also with the use of a prepared statement and binding parameters.

This confirms that the vulnerability was indeed a SQL injection issue, which was corrected by using prepared statements and parameterized queries.
