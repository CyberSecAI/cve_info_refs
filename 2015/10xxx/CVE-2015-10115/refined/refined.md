Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` in the `process_request` function of the `class-woosidebars-sbm-converter.php` file without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `$_GET['action']` parameter is being passed directly to `add_query_arg` after only being run through `urlencode`. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary query parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Query Parameter Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary query parameters through the `$_GET['action']` parameter.
- **Unsafe Redirection:**  The code then uses `wp_safe_redirect` with the constructed URL, which can be abused. Even with wp_safe_redirect, it is possible to cause a redirect to an attacker controlled page by adding a crafted query parameter, making it a open redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Open Redirect:** By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could redirect users to an arbitrary website of their choosing. This can be used for phishing attacks, to steal user credentials, or spread malware.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Depending on how the application handles query parameters, this vulnerability might be chained with other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with an injected `action` parameter containing the desired malicious query parameters.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking the crafted link, which would then redirect them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to visit the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet in `classes/class-woosidebars-sbm-converter.php` before the fix:

```php
wp_safe_redirect( add_query_arg( 'type', urlencode( $_GET['action'] ), add_query_arg( 'status', urlencode( $status ), add_query_arg( 'page', urlencode( $this->token ), admin_url( 'tools.php' ) ) ) ) );
```

The fix in the same file:

```php
wp_safe_redirect( esc_url( add_query_arg( 'type', urlencode( $_GET['action'] ), add_query_arg( 'status', urlencode( $status ), add_query_arg( 'page', urlencode( $this->token ), admin_url( 'tools.php' ) ) ) ) ) );
```

The fix involves passing the output of `add_query_arg` through `esc_url`, which properly sanitizes the URL.

This commit also updates the changelog and readme files to reflect the security fix, and increments the version number from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2.
