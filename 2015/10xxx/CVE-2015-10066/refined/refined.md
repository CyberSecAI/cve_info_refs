The provided content is a diff of a commit, which appears to be addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `Store.class.php` file.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The original code was directly embedding user-supplied values into SQL queries, specifically in the `getById`, `getByColumns`, `insert`, and `update` functions. This is vulnerable to SQL injection if these values are not properly sanitized or escaped.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled input with SQL keywords and operators, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    - In `getById`, the original code directly embeds `$id` into the query.
    - In `getByColumns`, the code iterates through `$columns` and concatenates keys and values into the query, with no sanitization of the keys and basic escaping of values.
    - In `insert`, it packs values with `packValue()` then uses the results in `Store::$pdo->exec`, and not in prepared statement.
    - In `update`, similarly it packs values with `packValue()` then uses the results in `Store::$pdo->exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise if the user-supplied inputs are not properly validated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through any of the functions which accept user controlled data for the purpose of constructing SQL queries, namely, `getById` with the `id` parameter, `getByColumns` with the `$columns` parameter, `insert` with the `$data` parameter, and `update` with `$id`, `$data` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control the values passed to these functions. This could be through direct user input on a web form or through manipulating a value stored in a database or elsewhere.

**Mitigation:** The commit attempts to mitigate these vulnerabilities by using prepared statements with PDO. The code is changed to use `Store::$pdo->prepare()` and `bindParam()` for value insertion, which prevents SQL injection. However, the commit contains remnants of the old insecure code paths as well. For example, the code still contains both the old string concatenation based SQL construction, and the new prepared statement based construction. This seems like an intermediate step in the refactoring of the code, where both are present.
