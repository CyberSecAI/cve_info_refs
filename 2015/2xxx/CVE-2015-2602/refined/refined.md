Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2602

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of file uploads within the `UploadFileContent` functionality of Oracle Endeca Information Discovery Integrator. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the paths of uploaded files.
*  **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability. The lack of sanitization allows attackers to place uploaded files at arbitrary locations within the file system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the Integrator component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the file upload vulnerability. However, the advisory mentions that an authentication bypass is also known.
*   **Impact:** By controlling the upload location, an attacker can overwrite critical files or upload malicious code (e.g., JSP or other server-executable files), leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the clover server (Endeca Integrator server).

**Affected Products:**

*   Oracle Endeca Information Discovery Studio versions 2.2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.0, and 3.1.

**CVSS Score:**

*   6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that Oracle released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley of Source Incite.
