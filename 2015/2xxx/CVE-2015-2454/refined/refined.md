**CVE-2015-2454: Windows KMD Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because the Windows kernel-mode driver (KMD) fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.
*   **Weakness:** Improper validation of impersonation levels.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass impersonation-level security.
    *   An attacker could gain elevated privileges on the targeted system.
    *   The security feature bypass itself does not directly enable arbitrary code execution but can be combined with other vulnerabilities for a more significant impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker must log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.
*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the targeted system.
