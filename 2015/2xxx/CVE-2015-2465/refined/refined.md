Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2465:

**Vulnerability:** Windows Shell Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because the Windows shell fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.

**Weakness:** Improper validation and enforcement of impersonation levels within the Windows shell.

**Impact:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can bypass impersonation-level security and gain elevated privileges on the targeted system. While this bypass alone doesn't allow arbitrary code execution, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability to achieve further compromise.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to log on to an affected system and execute a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the targeted system and run an application.
