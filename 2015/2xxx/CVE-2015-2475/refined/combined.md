## Vulnerability in UDDI Services Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3082459)

Published: August 11, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker engineered a cross-site scripting (XSS) scenario by inserting a malicious script into a webpage search parameter. A user would have to visit a specially crafted webpage where the malicious script would then be executed.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2008, except Itanium editions. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the UDDI Services encode and validate the parameter. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3082459](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3082459).

## Vulnerability Information

## UDDI Services Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2475

An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft Windows when the Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) Services improperly validate or sanitize the search parameter in a FRAME tag. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could leak authorization cookies or unexpectedly redirect a user to a malicious webpage.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could engineer a cross-site scripting (XSS) scenario by inserting a malicious script into a webpage search parameter. When a user visits the specially crafted webpage the malicious script is executed. This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the UDDI Services encode and validate the parameter.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
