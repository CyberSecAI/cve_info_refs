- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation or sanitization of the search parameter in a FRAME tag by the Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) Services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper encoding and validation of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leak authorization cookies or unexpectedly redirect a user to a malicious webpage. This could lead to elevation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could insert a malicious script into a webpage search parameter. A user would then need to visit this specially crafted webpage to execute the script. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in `/uddi/search/frames.aspx` with the `search` query parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, and induce a user to visit that URL.
