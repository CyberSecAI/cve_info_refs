{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'save' parameter in the configuration export function of the Sierra Wireless AirCard 760S/762S/763S Mobile Hotspot's web-based administrative console is not properly filtered, allowing for CRLF injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CRLF injection vulnerability in the HTTP header.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers, including 'Content-type', allowing them to control the content type of the response, and inject content into the HTTP response body. In the provided example, the attacker injects a .bat file containing a `pause` command, which would be executed if the user saves and opens it.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/export.cfg` endpoint, including a malicious 'save' parameter containing CRLF characters (%0d%0a) and the injected content and header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface and be aware of the device's hostname. The vulnerability does not require authentication, but does require user interaction (downloading and opening the crafted file)."
