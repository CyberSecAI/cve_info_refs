Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2857:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `oauth_token` parameter in the Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA). This parameter is passed to a `system()` command within multiple mod_perl handlers, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a metacharacter shell injection, where user-controlled input (`oauth_token`) is directly used in a system command without proper sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `oauth_token` before using it in a system call, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation (Effective):** Though code execution happens as the 'nobody' user, that user has nearly complete access to the appliance, including access to sensitive data like the MySQL database password, usernames, password hashes, LDAP credentials, event logs, and information about uploaded files, and all files uploaded to the appliance.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could steal sensitive information stored on the appliance.
- **System Compromise:**  An attacker could potentially gain complete control of the appliance through command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints.
- **Vulnerable Endpoints:** The vulnerable endpoints include `/tws/getStatus`, `/seos/find.api`, `/seos/put.api`, and `/seos/mput.api`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Accellion FTA.
- **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs a tool capable of sending HTTP POST requests.
- **No Authentication Required (for some attack vectors):** Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability in the `/tws/getStatus` endpoint for command execution.

**Technical Details:**
- The `oauth_token` is passed to the command line within the `get_oauth_customer_name()` and `verify_oauth_token()` functions located in `/home/seos/api/Md/Utils.pm`.
- The `system()` calls execute with the privileges of the web server user (nobody), however, this user has significant access to the file system due to default permission configurations.
- Example vulnerable code snippets:
  ```perl
  sub get_oauth_customer_name
  {
    my ($aid, $token) = @_;
    my $customer_name = `/opt/bin/perl /home/seos/system/call_webservice.pl $aid oauth_ws.php get_consumer_name '$token'`;
    return $customer_name;
  }
  sub verify_oauth_token
  {
    my ($aid, $token, $scope) = @_;
    my $client_id = `/opt/bin/perl /home/seos/system/call_webservice.pl $aid oauth_ws.php verify_access_token '$token' '$scope'`;
    return $client_id || 0;
  }
  ```
- A Metasploit module (`accellion_fta_getstatus_oauth.rb`) has been created to automate exploitation.
- The vulnerability was patched in version FTA_9_11_210 of the Accellion FTA.
