{
  "CVE-2015-2877": {
    "Description": "A new attack vector against memory deduplication in Virtual Machine Monitors (VMM) where attackers can effectively leak randomized base addresses of libraries and executables in processes of neighboring Virtual Machines (VM). The attack leverages a side-channel vulnerability in memory deduplication, where a malicious VM can detect shared memory pages because deduplicated pages incur higher write times due to copy-on-write operations.",
    "Root cause": "Memory deduplication implementations in Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) create a side channel that can be exploited to leak information about memory layout in other VMs. Specifically, the time difference between writes to shared and non-shared pages can be measured by an attacker.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability through memory deduplication.",
      "Limited entropy in randomized base addresses (RBAs).",
      "Existence of suitable memory pages with low entropy that contain or are directly derived from randomized base addresses."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with user privileges within a VM can reliably determine the randomized base addresses of libraries and executables in processes of a neighboring VM, thereby bypassing ASLR. This could enable code-reuse or return-oriented programming exploits.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed from within a malicious VM, targeting another VM on the same host.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires basic user rights within the attacking VM and the ability to measure memory write times. No root or elevated privileges are needed in the attacking VM."
