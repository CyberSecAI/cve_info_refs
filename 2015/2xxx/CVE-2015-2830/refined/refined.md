Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2830:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation support on 64-bit systems. Specifically, when a 64-bit process uses the `int 0x80` instruction to call `fork(2)` or `close(2)` system calls, the kernel does not properly handle the `TS_COMPAT` flag. This flag indicates the task is in 32-bit compatibility mode. The flag persists inappropriately in the child process, leading to an incorrect task state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Incorrect task state:** The child process inherits the `TS_COMPAT` flag incorrectly. This leads to misinterpretation of future syscalls made by the child process.
*   **Improper Handling of 'int80' entry:** The kernel does not properly handle the return from system calls originating from the `int 0x80` entry when 32-bit emulation is used, causing an incorrect return path for the child process.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Potential privilege escalation:** By mishandling the `TS_COMPAT` flag, the attacker may be able to bypass intended kernel limitations, such as seccomp policies or auditing mechanisms, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Misinterpretation of system calls:** The kernel could misinterpret subsequent system calls made by the affected task, potentially causing issues with security policies.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access. An unprivileged local attacker can exploit this flaw through a specially crafted application.
*   **System Calls:** The attacker leverages `fork(2)` or `close(2)` system calls using the `int 0x80` instruction within a 64-bit task with 32-bit emulation enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local, unprivileged access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **32-bit emulation enabled:** The system needs to have 32-bit emulation support enabled in the kernel ( `CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity in some advisories, "Moderate" in others, and "Important" in others, indicating some variation in the perceived risk level, likely depending on the specific environment.
*   The upstream fix is available at: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/956421fbb74c3a6261903f3836c0740187cf038b>.
*   Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu have released patches to address this issue in their respective products.
*  RHEL 5 is affected, but not planned to be addressed due to its nearing EOL.
*  This issue affects systems with 32bit emulation.
*  This issue can be used to circumvent seccomp.
