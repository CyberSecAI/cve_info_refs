Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2709:

**1. Verification:**

The provided text confirms that CVE-2015-2709 is related to "Miscellaneous memory safety hazards" in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, it is mentioned in the context of a security update for Mozilla Firefox that fixes multiple vulnerabilities, including "MFSA 2015-46 (CVE-2015-2708, CVE-2015-2709): Miscellaneous memory safety hazards".  Multiple sources within the provided content reference this CVE as part of a larger set of issues being addressed. Therefore this is considered **RELEVANT**

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The CVE description states that it is caused by "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine". The SUSE description specifies the vulnerabilities as "miscellaneous memory safety hazards", which suggests a lack of proper memory management, leading to potential use-after-free issues, buffer overflows, or other memory corruption issues. The provided Mozilla bug report for [bug 1128064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1128064) (which was marked as a duplicate of a related issue) highlights a specific case: a missing null pointer check in `nsPluginInstanceOwner::GetDocument`, which could lead to a use-after-free or memory-poisoning.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The main weakness is a lack of proper memory safety checks within the Firefox browser engine. This can manifest as:
    *   Use-after-free vulnerabilities
    *   Buffer overflows
    *   Memory corruption

*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to:
    *   Denial of service (application crash)
    *   Arbitrary code execution
    *   Potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information due to memory corruption

*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted website. An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious website containing specially crafted content. The specific methods to trigger the memory safety issues are not described in detail in the provided text, but involve some processing within the Firefox browser engine.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Ability to create a malicious web page.
    *   Ability to trick a user to visit that page using a vulnerable version of Firefox.
    *   No special user privileges are required. The attacker operates within the context of the user's browser process.
*  **Additional Information**:
    *   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Firefox, including ESR and also affects Thunderbird.
    *   The SUSE security advisory also provides CVSS scores, rating the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts as Partial (Partial/Partial/Partial), which all match a base score of 7.5, indicating a generally important vulnerability.

The vulnerability detailed in bug [1128064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1128064) (a crash in `nsPluginInstanceOwner::GetDocument`), appears to be a specific manifestation of the general memory safety hazards that CVE-2015-2709 encompasses. It was found that a null `mContent` pointer was not handled leading to use-after-free. The patch attached for that issue adds a null check to prevent this specific issue.

**Summary of Findings:**

CVE-2015-2709 is a broad vulnerability classification for memory safety issues within Mozilla Firefox. It can result in arbitrary code execution and/or DoS. The attack vector is a malicious website. This particular CVE groups together several different, but related memory-safety issues that were fixed together in a major update.

The specific instance of this vulnerability detailed in bug [1128064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1128064) is related to improper handling of a null content pointer for a plugin, which leads to a use-after-free condition.
