Here's an analysis of the provided documents regarding CVE-2015-2717:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2717

**Description:** Integer overflow in libstagefright in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read) via an MP4 video file containing invalid metadata.

**Root Cause:**

*   Integer overflow in the `MPEG4Extractor::parseMetaData()` function within the libstagefright library.
*   A specially crafted MP4 file with a `size` field set to `0xffffffff` can trigger the integer overflow, leading to allocation of a small buffer.
*   Later, a large amount of data (0xffffffff bytes) is attempted to be copied into this small buffer, resulting in a heap overflow.

**Vulnerability:**

*   Heap-based buffer overflow
*   Out-of-bounds read

**Impact:**

*   Remote code execution
*   Denial of service (application crash)
*   Heap memory corruption

**Attack Vector:**

*   A remote attacker can entice a user to open a specially crafted MP4 video file.
*   The crafted MP4 contains invalid metadata that triggers the integer overflow during parsing.

**Affected Software:**

*   Mozilla Firefox (versions prior to 38.0)
*   Mozilla Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.7
*   SeaMonkey (version 2.35)
*   Mozilla Thunderbird before 31.7

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to Firefox 38 or later
*   Update to Firefox ESR 31.7 or later
*   Update to SeaMonkey 2.35 or later
*   Update to Thunderbird 31.7 or later

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in `media/libstagefright/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/MPEG4Extractor.cpp`.
*   The problematic code involves a calculation where `size` (read from the MP4 file) is added to `chunk_size` without proper overflow checking.
*   An attacker can control the `size` value in the MP4 to trigger the overflow.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) MP4 file exists that triggers the integer overflow.
*   The fix involves adding a check to prevent the integer overflow from occurring.
