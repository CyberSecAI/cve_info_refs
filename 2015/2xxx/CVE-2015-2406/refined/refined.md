- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of the system if the user has administrative privileges. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Hosting a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Internet Explorer.
    - Embedding an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.
    - Exploiting compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements containing specially crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content, for instance, by tricking them into clicking a link or opening an attachment.
