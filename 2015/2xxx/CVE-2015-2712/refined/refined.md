{
  "CVE-2015-2712": {
    "description": "The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not properly determine heap lengths during identification of cases in which bounds checking may be safely skipped, which allows remote attackers to trigger out-of-bounds write operations and possibly execute arbitrary code, or trigger out-of-bounds read operations and possibly obtain sensitive information from process memory, via crafted JavaScript.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect calculation of heap lengths in asm.js during bounds check elimination.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
        "Out-of-bounds write",
         "Heap memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. An attacker can also read memory leading to disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code, specifically an asm.js change-heap function with a manipulated minLengthExclusive value.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted webpage containing malicious javascript."
