Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver leaking private address information during a function call. This happens because the driver improperly handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).
- The driver leaks kernel memory contents, specifically private address information during a function call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could use this information to gain knowledge of the system's memory layout, which can then be used to bypass security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- This vulnerability on its own does not allow for arbitrary code execution.
- However, it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and gain control of the system.
- Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive kernel information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be able to log on to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would then need to run a specially crafted application that triggers the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to log on to the affected system.
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows, including Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1.
- The security update corrects the vulnerability by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory, preventing the leak of private address information.
- At the time of the security bulletin's release, Microsoft had not received any information to suggest the vulnerability was being used in public attacks.
- This vulnerability is addressed by the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-073, specifically by the update package 3070102.
