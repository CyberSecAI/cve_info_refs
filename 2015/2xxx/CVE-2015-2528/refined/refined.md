  "CVE-2015-2528": {
    "Root cause": "Improper validation and enforcement of impersonation levels within Microsoft Windows.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Failure to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass impersonation-level security checks, gaining elevated privileges on the system. The attacker can then run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system, install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with access to the system can run a specially crafted application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid logon session on the targeted system to execute a malicious application."
  }
