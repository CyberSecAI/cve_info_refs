Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow that occurs within the PTC Creo View browser plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a heap buffer overflow, meaning the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Context of Execution:** The code execution occurs within the context of the browser, which can potentially lead to further compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs user interaction, specifically the target user must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious page or provide a malicious file to the target.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be able to craft a payload that triggers the heap overflow by setting a large buffer to a specific attribute within the Creo View plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vendor Fix:** PTC has released an update to address the vulnerability.
*   **Trend Micro Protection:** Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via filters '13914' and '13915'.
*   **Reported by:** Andrea Micalizzi (rgod)

In summary, CVE-2015-2061 describes a heap buffer overflow in the PTC Creo View browser plugin that allows remote attackers to achieve code execution by enticing a user to interact with a malicious resource.
