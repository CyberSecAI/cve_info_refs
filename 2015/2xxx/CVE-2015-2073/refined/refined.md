Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SAP Business Objects File Repository Server (FRS) CORBA listener, which lacks proper authentication. This allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files stored within the FRS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The core weakness is the absence of authentication checks when accessing the FRS via CORBA.
- **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify the file to be read, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** A remote attacker can retrieve sensitive business data stored in the FRS without any authentication.
- **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read arbitrary files leads to the disclosure of potentially confidential information.
- **Potential for Brute-forcing:** Although unlikely, an attacker could attempt to guess directory and file names, potentially mapping the file system over time. This is especially true if file naming conventions are predictable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the CORBA protocol.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required, meaning any attacker with network access to the vulnerable service can exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SAP Business Objects server.
- **Knowledge of File Path/Name:** The attacker needs to know or guess the file paths within the FRS.
