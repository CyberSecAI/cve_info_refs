Onapsis Security Advisory ONAPSIS-2015-002: SAP Business Objects
Unauthorized File Repository Server Read via CORBA

1. Impact on Business
=====================

By exploiting this vulnerability a remote unauthenticated attacker would be
able to retrieve sensitive business data stored on the remote system.

Risk Level: High

2. Advisory Information
=======================

- - Public Release Date: 2015-02-25

- - Subscriber Notification Date: 2015-02-25

- - Last Revised: 2015-02-25

- - Onapsis SVS ID: ONAPSIS-00111

- - CVE: CVE-2015-2073

- - Researcher: Will Vandevanter

- - Initial Base CVSS v2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

3. Vulnerability Information
============================

- - Vendor: SAP

- - Affected Components:
  - BussinessObjects Edge 4.0
  (Check SAP Note 2018682 for detailed information on affected releases)

- - Vulnerability Class: External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)

- - Locally Exploitable: No

- - Authentication Required: No

- - Original Advisory:
<http://www.onapsis.com/research/security-advisories/sap-business-objects-unauthorized-file-repository-server-read-via-corba>

4. Affected Components Description
==================================

Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.
It has components that provide performance management, planning,
reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.

Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact
with different platform services.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The BusinessObjects File Repositoy Server (FRS) CORBA listener allows a
user to read any file stored in the FRS without authentication. The only
requirement is that the user know the name of the file in the FRS. For
example, "Âfrs://Input/a_103/019/000/4967/1b14796c5b0d5f2c.rpt"Â. With
knowledge of this filename, the user can read the file remotely without
authentication.

Note, using CORBA it also possible to test if a directory or file exists
on the file system. Therefore, although unlikely, an attacker could
guess directories and then filenames to brute-force file locations. This
would be considerably easier with a predictable file naming convention.

6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2018682 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2018682>
Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
