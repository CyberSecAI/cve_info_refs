Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that arises when Microsoft Office improperly handles objects in memory. Specifically, it is a use-after-free vulnerability affecting how Excel processes BIFF records, as identified by Google Security Research.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This leads to potential corruption of memory and allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This can lead to installation of programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (specifically an Excel file): An attacker could send the malicious file as an email attachment or host it on a website. The victim needs to open the file to trigger the vulnerability.
    - Email Attack Scenario: An attacker sends the specially crafted file to the user, convincing them to open it.
    - Web-based Attack Scenario: An attacker hosts or leverages a compromised website containing the crafted file, enticing users to click a link to access the malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file, specifically an Excel file containing a malformed BIFF record.
- They need a way to deliver this malicious file to the target, either via email or a website.
- They need to persuade the victim to open the malicious file on a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides details on the specific location in the BIFF record where the corruption occurs (offset 0x237 and 0x34a5)
-  The crash occurs in Excel.exe!Ordinal40.
- The crash occurs due to a read from freed memory at address `esi`. The stack trace is also provided.
- The crash was observed on Excel 2007 (Windows 2003 R2), 2010 (Windows 7 x86) and 2013 (Windows 8.1 x86).

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is applying the security update provided by Microsoft.

**Workarounds:**
- No workarounds are identified in the Microsoft Security Bulletin.
