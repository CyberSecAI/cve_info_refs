Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a "special request" that can crash the Sybase SQL Anywhere process on the server. The specific nature of this special request is not detailed, but the core issue is a flaw in how the server handles specific inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a lack of proper input validation or error handling within Sybase SQL Anywhere, which allows a crafted request to cause a crash. This is classified as a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability according to CWE-122, which refers to a heap-based buffer overflow. However, the root cause can be input handling leading to other kind of crashes rather than a heap based overflow, as other details of the crash are not available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the Sybase SQL Anywhere process ceases to function, making the database unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a "special request" sent to the Sybase SQL Anywhere server.
- The attack is remotely exploitable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Sybase SQL Anywhere server.
- No specific authentication or authorization seems to be required, as the advisory mentions an "anonymous attacker."

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that Sybase SQL Anywhere versions 12 and 16 are confirmed to be vulnerable, and other versions are likely affected.
- A patch is available through SAP Security Note 2108161 to remediate the issue.
