Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the `process_nested_data` function within `ext/standard/var_unserializer.re` in PHP. This vulnerability is triggered during the unserialization process of data structures, specifically when the `unset` function is used within a `__wakeup` magic method.
- The root cause is related to an incomplete fix of  [CVE-2014-9427](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cve-2014-9427.html)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free condition: memory freed by `unset` is later accessed during the unserialization process through references (`R:` or `r:`).
- Type confusion due to lack of checks on the type of `__default_headers` when processing a `SoapClient`.
- Incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243 ([bug 654853](show_bug.cgi?id=654853 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-1: CVE-2006-7243: php5: NULL byte poisoning fix in php 5.3.4+")), regression in PHP versions 5.4 and above.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By exploiting the use-after-free and type confusion vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Denial of Service: A crafted unserialize call can lead to a crash of the PHP application due to memory corruption and access violation.
- Disclosure of sensitive information: Specifically crafted PHAR data can result in memory disclosure due to a buffer overflow.
- Bypass intended filename restrictions due to a NUL character in a pathname

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker by sending crafted data to a PHP application that performs unserialization, and by a specially crafted PHAR file.
- Specifically for the type confusion, a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted SOAP request.
- For the move_uploaded_file vulnerability, an attacker can achieve unauthorized file modification by using a crafted second argument with a NUL character.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send specially crafted data to a vulnerable PHP application, including through:
    - HTTP requests
    - SOAP requests
    - crafted PHAR files
- No authentication is required for remote exploitation.
- For local exploitation, the attacker requires the ability to execute arbitrary code through a PHP application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PHP versions 5.4.x before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7. It also affects PHP 5.3 and above (except 5.6.6 which contains the fix) and PHP 5.2.x is not affected
- A patch for the vulnerability is available on GitHub: <https://gist.github.com/smalyshev/eea9eafc7c88a4a6d10d>
- The vulnerability is related to other CVEs, indicating a recurring issue with input validation and memory management in PHP's unserialization process.
- The vulnerability affects multiple operating systems including openSUSE, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- Fixes involve checks for NULL bytes in paths and improved handling of memory during unserialization.
- The issue is described in detail in php bug [68976](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68976) and [69207](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69207)
- The fix for CVE-2006-7243 was incomplete and regressed in PHP versions 5.4 and later, leading to CVE-2015-2348.
- The vulnerability is present in ext/standard/var\_unserializer.re
- The fix includes a check for zero pos before erealloc to handle the use after free and an additional check that strlen(new\_path) != new\_path\_len to handle the truncation with NUL byte character in `move_uploaded_file()`
