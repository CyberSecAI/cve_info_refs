Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2330:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from WebKitGTK+ performing TLS certificate verification *after* sending the HTTP request, instead of before. This means that even if the TLS handshake fails, the HTTP request including potentially sensitive data (e.g., cookies) is already sent to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Late TLS Verification:** The core vulnerability is the delayed check for TLS errors. This exposes the application to sending data to servers with invalid certificates.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Specifically, the vulnerability can expose secure HTTP requests, potentially including sensitive information like secure cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker could potentially intercept or receive HTTP requests with sensitive data that should have been protected by a valid TLS connection. This is especially dangerous when sending authentication cookies or other user-specific information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could act as a MitM, presenting a server with an invalid certificate, and then potentially receive the secure request data sent by the vulnerable client before it detects the error.
*   **Malicious Server:** An attacker could control a malicious server and present an invalid certificate. A vulnerable client would send its request anyway, allowing the malicious server to capture the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or control a malicious server to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any specific user interaction beyond normal usage of the vulnerable application/browser.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** WebKitGTK+ versions prior to 2.6.6 are affected. The issue may also be corrected for WebKitGTK+ 2.6.5 and WebKitGTK+ 2.4.8 using the provided patch.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves connecting to the `notify::tls-errors` signal of the `SoupMessage` object. This allows the client to cancel the load earlier if a TLS error is detected.
*   **Policy:** The vulnerability is specifically relevant when the `WEBKIT_TLS_ERRORS_POLICY_FAIL` policy is active in the WebKit2GTK API.
*   **Testing:** The provided patch includes tests to verify that when the TLS policy is set to fail, the server does not process any requests if there are TLS errors.

In summary, this vulnerability is a serious issue allowing for potential information disclosure due to the late verification of TLS certificates. The fix involves early detection of TLS errors, preventing transmission of sensitive data over insecure connections.
