Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of authentication required for file uploads in Berta CMS. This allowed unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The primary vulnerability was that the file upload functionality did not require any form of authentication. This allowed anyone to upload files without needing to log in or provide any credentials.
*   **Insufficient File Validation:** The system only verified if an uploaded file could be processed as an image by `getimagesize()`. This was insufficient, as malicious PHP files disguised as images (e.g., starting with "GIF89") could bypass this check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading malicious PHP files disguised as images, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, including data theft, defacement, and further attacks on other systems.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** As noted in the initial report, the vulnerability was discovered due to the use of a compromised Berta CMS website to redirect links in a phishing email. The arbitrary file upload vulnerability was exploited to compromise the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/engine/upload.php` script. This request contains the malicious PHP code disguised as an image within the `Filedata` field. No prior authentication was needed to send the malicious POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needed network access to the vulnerable Berta CMS instance. No prior knowledge or access to the server was required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Berta CMS version 0.8.10b.
*   The fix implemented authentication requirements for file uploads and also added session ID verification to the upload process.
*   The patch commit also includes fixes to the javascript file upload code to better handle 401 Unauthorized responses from the server during a file upload.
*   The vulnerability exists in the "Downloaded Berta" product and does not affect the "Hosted Berta" product.
*   The provided exploit code is a POST request containing a PHP file disguised as a GIF image and is used to execute `phpinfo()`.
