Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2844:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `cpanel` function within `go_site.php`. User-supplied parameters `$action` and `$type` are directly passed to the `exec` function without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because the input isn't sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` call. The vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    exec("/usr/share/goautodial/goautodialc.pl '/sbin/service $type ".strtolower($action)."'");
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.
- **Root Shell:** The exploit can be escalated to gain a root shell on the system, leading to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request to the `cpanel` function, including malicious code in the `$action` and/or `$type` variables.
   - URI: `https://<ip>/index.php/go_site/cpanel/$type/$action`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GoAutoDial server to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not appear to require authentication, as it is a vulnerability in the handling of user-supplied parameters in a web-facing component.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit uses base64 encoding to bypass potential web server encoding issues.
- The exploit can be used to execute a reverse shell, providing the attacker with interactive access to the server.
- This vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities in the same application (CVE-2015-2842, CVE-2015-2843 and CVE-2015-2845), which are also caused by a lack of input sanitization.
- The vendor advisory recommends upgrading to version 3.3-1421902800 or later to fix this issue.
