Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Windows' failure to properly enforce the Trusted Boot policy. This occurs due to an issue in how Windows parses the Boot Configuration Data (BCD).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a security feature bypass that allows an attacker to circumvent the intended protection of Trusted Boot.
- **Improper BCD Parsing:**  The vulnerability is triggered by the improper handling of the Boot Configuration Data, specifically when it is maliciously crafted, allowing for the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Integrity Check Disablement:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to disable code integrity checks, which are designed to prevent the loading of test-signed or malicious executables and drivers.
- **Bypass of BitLocker and Device Encryption:** The vulnerability also enables bypassing Trusted Boot integrity validation for BitLocker and Device Encryption features. This means that the security provided by these features could be compromised.
- **Loading of Malicious Code:**  An attacker could load test-signed or malicious drivers on the target device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious BCD Modification:** The attack vector involves an attacker applying a maliciously crafted Boot Configuration Data (BCD) setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges or Physical Access:** The attacker needs either administrative privileges or physical access to the target device to modify the BCD settings. This is required to exploit the vulnerability directly.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is publicly disclosed.
- Microsoft was unaware of any attacks exploiting this vulnerability at the time of the bulletin release.
- The bulletin mentions that local and remote reporting attestation solutions that process measurements from TPM TCG logs are also impacted by this vulnerability. This means these attestation systems could be reporting a "healthy" status, while in reality, the system may be compromised if the Trusted Boot mechanism was bypassed with a malicious BCD configuration.
