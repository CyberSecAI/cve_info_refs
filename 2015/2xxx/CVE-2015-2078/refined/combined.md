## Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor fails to properly validate SSL and installs non-unique root CA certificates and private keys

#### Vulnerability Note VU#529496

Original Release Date: 2015-02-19 | Last Revised: 2015-03-17

---

### Overview

Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor installs non-unique root CA certificates and private keys, making systems broadly vulnerable to HTTPS spoofing

### Description

| Komodia Redirector SDK is a self-described "interception engine" designed to enable developers to integrate proxy services and web traffic modification (such as [ad injection](http://www.komodia.com/ad-injection-sdk/)) into their applications. With the SSL Digestor module, HTTPS traffic can also be manipulated. This is accomplished by installing a root CA certificate into browser trusted certificate stores, enabling the proxy to effectively man-in-the-middle all web traffic without raising any flags for the end-user.  In multiple applications implementing Komodia's libraries, such as Superfish Visual Discovery and KeepMyFamilySecure, the root CA certificates have been found to use trivially obtainable, publicly disclosed, hard-coded private keys. Note that these keys appear to be distinct per application, though [the same methods](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html) have proven successful in revealing the private keys in each instance.In addition to sharing root CA certificates across installation, it has been reported that [the SSL validation that Komodia itself performs is broken](https://blog.filippo.io/komodia-superfish-ssl-validation-is-broken/). This vulnerability can allow an attacker to universally attack all installations of Komodia Redirector, rather than needing to focus on a single application / certificate.Users should be aware that uninstalling affected applications is not sufficient to remove the security risk since the root certificates are not removed in the process. Lenovo, whose consumer-grade systems come bundled with the software, have provided [instructions and an automated removal tool](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/superfish_uninstall). A list of potentially affected Lenovo systems is available [here](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929).Users can verify whether their systems contain Superfish and other Komodia root certificates by visiting [this site](https://filippo.io/Badfish/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can spoof HTTPS sites and intercept HTTPS traffic without triggering browser certificate warnings in affected systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Komodia has [updated](http://www.komodia.com/security-notice) their vulnerable libraries. Developers who use the Komodia libraries should update their applications.Users should check vendor websites for updates to affected software and apply them immediately. Given the severity of the issue, users who are unsure that an update addresses the vulnerability are strongly encouraged to consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Uninstall software using Komodia Redirector SDK and associated root CA certificates**Uninstall any software that includes the Komodia Redirector and SSL Digestor libraries. Refer to the Vendor Information section below for an updated list of known affected vendors.After uninstalling an offending application, it is also necessary to independently remove compromised root CA certificates. Note that the names of these certificates are likely to vary based on the originating application. Microsoft provides guidance on [deleting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772354.aspx) and [managing](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/view-or-manage-your-certificates) certificates in the Windows certificate store.Mozilla provides similar [guidance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA%3AUserCertDB#Deleting_a_Root_Certificate) for their software, including the Firefox and Thunderbird certificate stores. |

Notified:  February 20, 2015  Updated: February 25, 2015

**Statement Date:   February 23, 2015**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Here's the official statement from the company (on our website), announcing the
updated release which is now live:

<http://webcompanion.com/komodia-vulnerability-statement>

### Vendor Information

\* For the past year, Lavasoft was developing and testing a new security feature in Ad-Aware Web Companion to scan and eliminate malicious content/advertising in HTTPS traffic, including content injected by internet proxies installed on the PC.
\* This functionality was implemented with one of Komodia's public SDKs (the SSL Digestor). At no point was any encrypted information collected or analyzed. All analysis of incoming traffic to eliminate security risks was performed on the end-user's PC.
\* Several weeks prior to the public announcement of the root CA certificate vulnerability, and upon consultation with our partners and evaluation of the risks/benefits, Lavasoft took the decision to remove the functionality that required the SSL Digestor.
\* Lavasoft's most recent release of Ad-Aware Web Companion (released on February 18th 2015) does not include this capability, but we have confirmed that the compromised component of the Komodia SSL Digestor is still present. A new release of Web Companion will be issued imminently to correct this, with all end-users being notified of the update via the product. In the interim, the root CA certificate issued to "Lavasoft Limited" can be removed manually without consequences to the product.
\* Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha) 1.3.69.1 is an unreleased and unsupported product. Alpha testers who have not uninstalled it by now are instructed to do so immediately, and to manually check to ensure the root CA certificate has been deleted as we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the uninstaller in this pre-released version.

### Vendor References

* <http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_webcompanion.php>

### Addendum

Lavasoft Ad-Aware Web Companion 1.1.885.1766 and Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha) 1.3.69.1 are affected.

Alert
# Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing

Last RevisedSeptember 30, 2016
Alert CodeTA15-051A

### Systems Affected

Lenovo consumer PCs that have Superfish VisualDiscovery installed.

### Overview

Superfish adware installed on some Lenovo PCs install a non-unique trusted root certification authority (CA) certificate, allowing an attacker to spoof HTTPS traffic.

Starting in September 2014, Lenovo pre-installed Superfish VisualDiscovery spyware on some of their PCs. This software intercepts users’ web traffic to provide targeted advertisements.  In order to intercept encrypted connections (those using HTTPS), the software installs a trusted root CA certificate for Superfish. All browser-based encrypted traffic to the Internet is intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted to the user’s browser by the application – a classic man-in-the-middle attack.  Because the certificates used by Superfish are signed by the CA installed by the software, the browser will not display any warnings that the traffic is being tampered with.  Since the private key can easily be recovered from the Superfish software, an attacker can generate a certificate for any website that will be trusted by a system with the Superfish software installed.  This means websites, such as banking and email, can be spoofed without a warning from the browser.

Although [Lenovo has stated](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929) they have discontinued the practice of pre-installing Superfish VisualDiscovery, the systems that came with the software already installed will continue to be vulnerable until corrective actions have been taken.

To detect a system with Superfish installed, look for a HTTP GET request to:

superfish.aistcdn.com

The full request will look like:

http://superfish.aistcdn.com/set.php?ID=[GUID]&Action=[ACTION]

Where [ACTION] is at least 1, 2, or 3.  1 and then 2 are sent when a computer is turned on. 3 is sent when a computer is turned off.

Superfish uses a vulnerable SSL decryption library by Komodia. Other applications that use the library may be similarly affected. Please refer to CERT [Vulnerability Note VU#529496](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/529496) for more details and updates.

### Impact

A machine with Superfish VisualDiscovery installed will be vulnerable to SSL spoofing attacks without a warning from the browser.

### Solution

**Uninstall Superfish VisualDiscovery and associated root CA certificate**

Users should uninstall Superfish VisualDiscovery. Lenovo has provided a tool to [uninstall Superfish](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/PS500066?LinkTrack=Solr)and remove all associated certificates.

It is also necessary to remove affected root CA certificates. Simply uninstalling the software does not remove the certificate. Microsoft provides [guidance on deleting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772354.aspx) and [managing certificates](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/view-or-manage-your-certificates) in the Windows certificate store. In the case of Superfish VisualDiscovery, the offending trusted root certification authority certificate is issued to “Superfish, Inc.”

[Mozilla provides similar guidance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA%3AUserCertDB#Deleting_a_Root_Certificate) for their software, including the Firefox and Thunderbird certificate stores.

# Komodia/Superfish SSL Validation is broken

*If you are on the ball already and just want the new vulnerability, scroll to the "client side SSL verification" section.* tl;dr The Komodia/Superfish proxy can be made to allow self-signed certificates without warnings.

## Recap

Some Lenovo laptops [shipped](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/?ref=words.filippo.io) with [Superfish](http://www.home.superfish.com/?ref=words.filippo.io) preinstalled - an ad injecting software. How it performs ad injection is by using [a SSL interception engine](https://archive.today/pFrkq?ref=words.filippo.io) by [Komodia](https://archive.today/www.komodia.com?ref=words.filippo.io).

The software is spectacularly bad, and uses the same key on all computers, [which was extracted easily](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html?ref=words.filippo.io), allowing hackers to intercept the secure connections of anyone who has Superfish installed. I made a [online test, Badfish](https://filippo.io/Badfish/?ref=words.filippo.io).

**But Superfish [is not the only one](http://marcrogers.org/2015/02/19/will-the-madness-never-end-komodia-ssl-certificates-are-everywhere/?ref=words.filippo.io) using the Komodia engine.** All softwares that do share the same problem, and [their keys can be extracted easily](https://gist.github.com/Wack0/17c56b77a90073be81d3?ref=words.filippo.io) (same password: "komodia").

However, that's not even necessary, because Komodia is horribly broken.

## How Komodia works

A brief step back to understand how Komodia does SSL/TLS interception and what that means.

On installation the Komodia software will **install a root CA certificate** in the system trust store.

Then when a user tries to visit a HTTPS website, the software will intercept the connection and place itself between the browser and the server.

It will then connect to the server as a client, and relay data between the two. As a certificate to the client it will present **a copy of the server certificate, with a different public key and signed by the root it installed**.

In short, a Man in the Middle attack.

What we all realized in horror is that **the root private key is the same on all machines**, so anyone can take that and sign fake certificates to use in MitM attacks.

(For the record, this could have been a bit less bad if the proxy client rejected its own certificate, but whatever.)

Note that this also means that the actual HTTPS connection is handled by the Komodia proxy client - that is, **it's the Komodia software that will connect to the server over the Internet**. And it's not that good at it: [it will use obsolete cryptography, for example](https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/568598220504494080?ref=words.filippo.io).

Anyway, we thought things couldn't get worse. But.

## Komodia client side SSL verification

At this point a legit doubt is: **what will the Komodia proxy client do when it sees a invalid/untrusted/self-signed certificate?** Because copying it, changing its public key and signing it would *turn it into a valid one without warnings*.

Turns out that if a certificate fails validation the Komodia proxy **will still re-sign it** (making it trusted), but **change the domain name** so that a warning is triggered in the browser.

See in the picture below how the certificate name became `verify_fail.events.ccc.de` to "propagate" the failure to the browser.

![](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2015/02/B-QcLXHIAAAvawx.jpg)

Hm, still bad since the user/browser will receive fake information on why the certificate is invalid, but clever.

**However.**

The Komodia proxy copies the server certificate almost entirely... What will it do with **alternative names**?

Alternative names are a X509 extension that allows to specify in a special field other domains for which the certificate is valid.

![](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2015/02/IE11---Win8-1--28Superfished-29--5BRunning-5D-2015-02-20-15-37-05.png)

Boom. **The Komodia proxy will take a self-signed certificate, leave the alternate names untouched and sign it with their root.** The browser will think it's a completely valid certificate.

So all you need to do to bypass verification is put the target domain in the alternate field, instead of in the main one that will be changed on failure.

An attacker can intercept any https connection, present a self-signed certificate to the client and browsers will show a green lock because Komodia will sign it for them.

## Consequences

This means that whoever has Komodia software running on their system will accept ANY certificate that has the domain name in the alternates.

No need to extract root keys from each software, this allows MitM against all Komodia-using software at the same time.

**It's catastrophic.

It's the only way all this mess could have been even worse.**

They can change the keys, or start doing the sane thing and generate a keypair for each device, but *this bug will still allow MitM attacks*. And with this **attackers don't even need to know what software you are running**, it's a catch-all against the Komodia engine itself.

So all the users out there with Komodia-powered Parental Control software or adware have their banking connections easily intercepted. Well, good job.

~~Yes, a online test is coming. Meanwhile, I serve such a cert at [san.filippo.io](https://san.filippo.io/?ref=words.filippo.io).~~

UPDATE: my [online test](https://filippo.io/Badfish/?ref=words.filippo.io) now checks for all Komodia-powered software with the trick above.

## Conclusions

First, don't make intercepting proxies. They are impossible to write correctly, and by their very nature lower the security of the whole Internet.

Second, the Komodia one is a particularly bad one, and they should feel bad.

Third, Komodia should be punished for jeopardizing the users, like probably all the companies that didn't do due diligence here.

### Extracting the SuperFish certificate

I extracted the [certificate](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.pem) from the SuperFish adware and cracked the password ("*komodia*") that encrypted it. I discuss how down below. The consequence is that [I can intercept the encrypted communications](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/exploiting-superfish-certificate.html) of SuperFish's victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out near them at a cafe wifi hotspot. Note: this is probably trafficking in illegal access devices under the proposed revisions to the CFAA, so get it now before they change the law.

I used simple reversing to find the certificate. As [reported by others](https://twitter.com/supersat/status/568317254766440449), program is packed and self-encrypted (like typical adware/malware). The proper way to reverse engineer this is to run the software in a debugger (or IDApro), setting break point right after it decrypts itself. The goal is to set the right break point before it actually infects your machine -- reversers have been known to infect themselves this way.

The ghetto way is to just to run this on a machine, infecting yourself, and run "[procdump](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx)" (by @markrussinovich) in order to dump the process's memory. That's what I did, by running the following command:
> procdump -ma VisualDiscovery.exe super.dmp

The proper reversing is to actually tear apart the memory structures, such as using VisualStudio:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXIecbeg_OUKW2z7b6q9Vk0zfjhslPqon40pbov2KFdFENyxCH75tW56wy4Xjfn9Y4P24QhskvVE7lP7qd0B56SB47WXpRj-NyhAhpdNxJMhMhqm3xtXcILMXIFWUk0W_3nFZh/s1600/super-vs.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXIecbeg_OUKW2z7b6q9Vk0zfjhslPqon40pbov2KFdFENyxCH75tW56wy4Xjfn9Y4P24QhskvVE7lP7qd0B56SB47WXpRj-NyhAhpdNxJMhMhqm3xtXcILMXIFWUk0W_3nFZh/s1600/super-vs.png)

The ghetto reversing is to run *strings*. This is an ancient (mid-1980s) program that simply extracts human readable strings out of a binary file, discarding the rest. It's really a stupid simple program.
> strings super.dmp > super.txt

At that point, I load the file *super.txt* into a text editor and searched for the string "PRIVATE KEY". Sure enough, it popped right up. It's actually located several times in the memory dump.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJNoZg8rtBsHQMEMdg3FE3Sc9wYjksXfIhmN1KRBg85AYo9TpylfczdQ1NBwVwaRgjDIcKwgcumqxenSeg8qS_cGmzFZ1WjObW5ow72RKnzeUEGTo5X7qEkCjp7T_WBgUIRaXT/s1600/super-01.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJNoZg8rtBsHQMEMdg3FE3Sc9wYjksXfIhmN1KRBg85AYo9TpylfczdQ1NBwVwaRgjDIcKwgcumqxenSeg8qS_cGmzFZ1WjObW5ow72RKnzeUEGTo5X7qEkCjp7T_WBgUIRaXT/s1600/super-01.png)

At this point, I copied/pasted the certificate into a file *[super.pem](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.pem)*. I then attempted to look at it using OpenSSL. However, I was presented with a password prompt. This file has been encrypted with a password.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahRDhG2EM1Aizg6QHCg6b55YcXKudgCwlj-3VoUctJspwi0rmGxrNbFpUxEOzXg06uBz2WAcRAdlwaT0X4LYTudGcTbdRUqBfSwi9hDad2mcr38MTC7odg9nUWKE-mK2JkZfw/s1600/super-02.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahRDhG2EM1Aizg6QHCg6b55YcXKudgCwlj-3VoUctJspwi0rmGxrNbFpUxEOzXg06uBz2WAcRAdlwaT0X4LYTudGcTbdRUqBfSwi9hDad2mcr38MTC7odg9nUWKE-mK2JkZfw/s1600/super-02.png)

Okay, that's annoying, but that just means we need to crack the password. However, I can't find a password cracker on the Internet that handles SSL PEM files, so I wrote my own [certificate password cracker](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack). It's pretty bad, using the OpenSSL decrypt API in a single thread, so it's not pretty. But it's sufficient for my needs.

The encryption is actually pretty good, meaning I can only do a couple hundred guesses per second. This means that there is no chance of *brute-forcing* any password longer than 5 characters (*brute-force* means to try all possible combinations), it'd take billions of years. Instead, I want to do a *dictionary* attack. This is where I load a file of common words and test them one-by-one to see if they work.

I tried the small dictionary *john.dict* that comes with John-the-Ripper, and it didn't find anything. But of course, I don't need a real dictionary. The password is probably also in the clear in the memory dump. I could just use the file *super.txt* as my dictionary! I tried this, but it was taking a *long* time, with 150k unique lines of text. It'd take many hours to complete. To speed things up, I filtered the list for just lower-case words
> grep "^[a-z]\*$" super.txt | sort | uniq > super.dict

This leaves a dictionary of only [2203 words](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.dict). I ran my cracking tool, and found the password in 10 seconds, "komodia".

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLuMTyEB05Z9ZgCBJvC2JHrdujUCj-OtA4iD0LMppOVSSh6OyMpeX2q9WtJuq0tLOe9bgMsKC7YQthdYDraJhO1yyHEhqqN4QBriRK-3MTo5xtjql44cdPwZ-JZN1DPBBSt_Lf/s1600/super-03.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLuMTyEB05Z9ZgCBJvC2JHrdujUCj-OtA4iD0LMppOVSSh6OyMpeX2q9WtJuq0tLOe9bgMsKC7YQthdYDraJhO1yyHEhqqN4QBriRK-3MTo5xtjql44cdPwZ-JZN1DPBBSt_Lf/s1600/super-03.png)

Armed with this password, I continued where I left off with the *openssl* command-line tool and successfully decoded the certificate. I can now use this to Man-in-the-Middle people with Lenovo desktops (in theory, I haven't tried it yet).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglxTo8SPNmBsVUHShwP6v5v-OGpvZtEDIZc_1iDpOzOsup0Eyi0DPSY78RtvD0J-a5tsDXRZZ3aSbyfRjGYFlztnkMoKaT8M9TgYOwqK9nEb4vxjCcVBCuEwGGnuodOjXs0VYT/s1600/super-04.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglxTo8SPNmBsVUHShwP6v5v-OGpvZtEDIZc_1iDpOzOsup0Eyi0DPSY78RtvD0J-a5tsDXRZZ3aSbyfRjGYFlztnkMoKaT8M9TgYOwqK9nEb4vxjCcVBCuEwGGnuodOjXs0VYT/s1600/super-04.png)

Note that the password "komodia" is suggestive -- that's a [company](http://www.komodia.com/) that makes an SSL "redirector" for doing exactly the sort of interception that SuperFish is doing. They market it as security software so you can spy on your kids, and stuff. A description of this component, their "SSL Digester", is [here](http://www.komodia.com/wiki/index.php?title=SSL_Digestor). They market it for "ad injection" [here](http://www.komodia.com/ad-injection-sdk/). That site teaches us a lot about what SuperFish can do.

(BTW, thanks to @chigley101 for [linking a download](https://twitter.com/chigley101/status/568369711995592705) of the software. Also note that @supersat and @paul\_pearce found the password before I did, though as far as I know they haven't published it. Note that it's Chris Palmer (@fugueish) that first noticed the implications of these certificates).

I strongly suspect Komodia's Redirector shares the exact same certificate.

Yes, I have very little faith left in mankind, why ask ?

That regexp looks like a good way to make your dictionnary very small. Very very small.

Why/how would the password be in the memory dump?

@Matthew Aho - to some extent it depends on how lazy the authors were. even just base64 encoding of the password would have hidden it from strings!

The userify enterprise binary has an easter egg visible only from strings :)

The password needs to be available to the software in order for it to sign certificates with the private key. It could be somewhat obfuscated, but there's really nothing the authors could do to prevent someone with moderate reverse engineering skills from learning it fairly quickly.

Sooo.... the passphrase was all lower-case, the name of the company that made it.

It wasn't some random long string of characters. It wasn't the name of the CEO's first pet dog. It wasn't *even* "Komodia123".

Let that sink in a moment. The creators of this system were so amazingly incompetent, I'm honestly surprised it works at all.

Is this detectable on the server end by looking at the signature of the client certificate? It would be great for websites to block or warn people running this software.

Good job! I do not understand why the password was stored in cleartext in memory. I mean if they went through the trouble of hiding a malware deep within the hardware, why did they store the password in plaintext in memory?

I have to ask, but couldn't they generate the SSL certificate upon install. Such that each install of the program has a unique certificate.

Then the cert would be useless for man in the middle attacks.

"The consequence is that I can intercept the encrypted communications of SuperFish's victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out near them at a cafe wifi hotspot."

How? By just passively reading and decrypting or by providing a MITM proxy that uses that certificate yourself?

The first case would mean that the connections between the infected laptops and "the internet" already use that key, i.e. the superfish https MITM proxy is somewhere in the internet. Why would they even need the private key in the software then?

If their MITM proxy runs on the infected machines then the connections to the actual websites should use the real certificates - and you'd have to run your own MITM proxy, so just passive snooping wouldn't be enough.
(Not that running such a proxy is very hard...)

Just wondering, I haven't read much about the technical details of superfish yet :-)

If they "hide" the password on the binary in plain text, they should at least use something like "m cannot be run in D" as password, as half-jokingly suggested at <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5316925/371250>. At least the reverser will have some good laughs.

@Peter Pezaris:
Sorry, but just working around the problem with a tag was (and is) irresponsible.

It basically makes it harder for someone to notice that his PC is infected.

Glip should have made the problem public back then.
Ideally they would have tried to detect if the superfish JS was injected and warn affected users that they seem to be "infected" with "superfish" and should get rid of it.

I don't know 100% if that's possible from the JS-side, though (I'm not a web developer), but https://filippo.io/Badfish/ has found a way to test it by trying to load an image from a https server that uses a certificate signed by the SuperFish certificate.

So now that a way to detect superfish is known, one \*really\* shouldn't try to work around it (so your costumers think they have a working machine), but either try to detect superfish and display a warning, or at least do nothing so that the user hopefully notices that something is wrong and that he may have a malware problem.

By the way, this tag will \*not\* make superfish go away or anything, the traffic still is intercepted by them, the only difference is that their javascript (to show their ads) is not executed anymore.

Is it not that Komodia is a MIM tool which executes in memory of a workstation, between the network interface and the browser? So the traffic between the workstations NIC and the web server is still encrypted with the domain SSL certificate. Then Komodia acts like a browser, using the public key to decrypt the content for instpection. To fool the browser, it re-encrypts the content again with it's own certificate so the browser won't show a warning to the user.

I believe that it will not be possible to snoop https traffic in an internet cafe just because you have the komodia certificate. You'd have to be breaking into the computer and hook in between komodia and the browser.

Doesn't this violate the DMCA terms of attempting to thwart someone's encryption scheme? I'm not talking about the Extracting the key, I'm talking about the MITM attack.

Seems like the company that sells such SW should be in violation and subject to prosecution.

Lenovo would at least be on the hook as an accessory in that case.

@Matt: Even if that were true, it would still be a very bad thing. Lenovo / Superfish / Komodia would be installing software with the capability to read every bit of encrypted web traffic from a customer's computer (credentials, banking information, etc.) They have no business doing that, for ANY reason. Any vendor who feels they can or should do this, can fuck off.

However, this situation is worse. Not only were they malicious, they were incompetent. By installing the same root certificate and key pair (easily stolen) on every computer, now anyone who wants to put in about 60 seconds of effort can forge a trusted SSL certificate for any website on the planet. They can execute MITM attacks against these vulnerable computers and steal all of the same information, without needing to run any malicious code on the vulnerable PC itself. (Lenovo, Superfish and Komodia have taken care of installing the malicious code already; thanks!) These MITM attacks would be tricky to detect; there could be nothing alarming about the site at first glance, unless you went out of your way to examine the SSL certificate and saw that it was issued by Superfish, Inc instead of some trusted, established CA.

> I have to ask, but couldn't they generate the SSL certificate upon install.

They cant. Windows does not allow software to add certificates to the Windows certificate store without prompting the user. The operation occurs in isolated code, isolated in the same way that passwords prompts are isolated.

The only way they can get the extra certificate into the certificate store without prompting a user is to pre-install it on the factory image.

The problem is manyfold:
- The SuperFish Proxy \*doesn't\* do SSL validation for the endpoint certs (the ones from the site). Someone infected with SuperFish can be tricked into entering a site using a selfsigned cert and the user wouldn't even know about this.
- If you removed/disabled the SuperFish proxy, you still have the SuperFish CA in your trusted certstore. Someone can pose as Google, Bank of America, whatever.
Any of these things can easily happen if you are using public wifi hotspots, as it is common for some to set up "free hotspots" that actually do MITM attacks if they can.

I missed something ? If the private key was used to sign the traffic in MitM software, why it has to be bruteforced ?

Good article. One that provides technical details instead of lot of Superfish articles out there with scary messages.

If I understand correctly, Lenovo is installing a https proxy to intercept traffic (vs common proxies you find in enterprises that use http CONNECT verb to proxy https traffic). The proxy is creating self signed certs for every https site the browser is visiting, but signed by the root CA inside the proxy. The browser’s root cert store is updated with proxy’s root CA chain. But the proxy still communicates to destination over https doing usual https validations (like checking for self-signed certs vs Verisign signed ones etc).

I don’t think someone out there in the wild can decrypt data even if they have root CA private key as the proxy to destination site is https session which is protected by destination site’s private/public key pair. I saw articles claiming that they could decrypt https traffic if they are at a Cafe by having the root CA. But how?
The https traffic that gets affected by this proxy is the one from browser to localhost:proxy port. It beats me how someone outside the box can sniff that traffic.

Am I missing something here?

But someone out there can create a site that looks like say bankofamerica.com site with self signed cert signed by above root CA and start a phishing attack. If a customer with the Superfish software press that link and go to that site, the browser won’t warn that it is a phishing site.

This is far fetched and the impact is lot less than what most of the Superfish articles are portraying. Neverthless it is a bad business decision by Lenovo to install something like this at factory. I bet they will have a challenge selling into enterprises with the -ve press that this caused.

A super article.

Two references in the article, labeled, [i]here[/i] are not available now possibly due to a DDOS attack happening as I write.

No prob!. The Products tab at this archived Komodia page [i]https://web.archive.org/web/20141221102728/http://www.komodia.com/[/i] takes you to the first reference, for [b]SSL Digestor[b/] (note this is the "correct" spelling in that it matches the web site, although it is only correctly [English usage].

The description of the [b]Ad Injector[/b] is also reachable from this tab. The Ad Injector product is interesting to me as it gives the mechanism for Javascript injection that can co-exist with global proxy injection.

For example, There is a call to the .exe with install flags, and it can intercept a browser, then inspect it using the DLL or COM framework and decide to inject Javascript or a HTML component.

They could have used a RSA whitebox to sign those fake certificates. It would have been way harder to reverse it.

My name is Lizzy Desler, i am from US I live in Indiana, US, I have been married for over 8years and no issue(baby) to show for it, i and my husband have gone to different places for help for me to get pregnant, but all our efforts
where fruitless. My husband became tired of me and started accusing me of the cause of our problem. I tried to make him believe that I don't know why I cannot get pregnant. But as a
man he pays deaf ears to my words. It came to a time when he gave me an ultimatum to leave his house. I became more crazy and restless. I search for help including where there is no help. My husband finally sent me packing after 8years of our marriage. when I was in my parents house I was still searching for a solution until I met an old school friend whom gave me the contact of this Great Spell Caster pristbabalalokpe, she said he saved her marriage too. I contacted him for help. He told me that it is never too late that I will need two spell in one. Which means an ex back spell and a fertility spell. He actually cast a spell for me after 48hours of his spell; my husband came to my parents? house looking for me. We got back together again. That made me so happy. Still with his fertility spell, I became pregnant after 2months of his spell. What a powerful man. I am the happiest person on earth. If you need any help, I recommend this great man to you, I am so sure he will help you the way he helped me. E-mail: pristbabalalokpe@gmail.com or +2348079125378

Hello Everyone My name is flavie zackary am from UK , I have been married for over 7years and no issue(baby) to show for it, I and my husband have gone to different places for help for me to get pregnant, but all our efforts where fruitless. My husband became tired of me and started accusing me of the cause of our problem. I tried to make him believe that I don’t know why I cannot get pregnant. But as a man he pays deaf ears to my words. It came to a time when he gave me an ultimatum to leave his house. I became more crazy and restless. I search for help including where there is no help. My husband finally sent me packing after 7years of our marriage. when I was in my parents’ house I was still searching for a solution until I met an old school friend whom gave me the contact of this spell caster Dr Ogba, she said he saved her marriage too. I contacted him for help. He told me that it is never too late that I will need two spell in one. Which means an ex back spell and a fertility spell. He actually cast a spell for me after 48hours of his spell; my husband came to my parents’ house looking for me pleading for forgiveness and i forgive him . We got back together again. That made me so happy. Still with his fertility spell, I became pregnant after 2months of his spell. What a powerful great man. I am the happiest person on earth. If you need any help I recommend this great man to you, I am so sure he will help you the way he helped me. contact him on his mail ogbapaullovespellcaster1@gmail.com or +2348116144331......

Anderson is my name, there is indeed no GLORY without a story. Beloved, i am so overwhelmed that i scaled
through the huddles of life. this won't have been
possible without a wonderful person i met in my life,
whom was introduced to me. in person of High Priest Otigbolor. With all sincerity and a glad heart, i want to say thank you for making my failed marriage work again, my husband is now back and we are living happily like never before. my entire life has been a testimony since i came in contact with you, i am not good in typing i would have typed all that happened and how High Priest Otigbolor stepped in. He stepped in and he calmed the storm in my life. High Priest Otigbolor can calm your storm too. he is one in town and so good to be true. contact him for any difficulty or problems
whatsoever on highpriestotigbolor66@gmail.com he is more that willing to attend to your need and make sure you get a solution and testimony. He has been tested and trusted.

I honestly thought that my marriage was healthy. i loved my husband with all my heart. we was married 8 years and have a 3 yr old son. we bought a house 2 months ago. i told him i was pregnant…then he starting acting strange. he didn't want me to keep the baby. one day i decided to tell him i could not go through with not having the baby (about 2 months pregnant), then he tells me he doesn't love me anymore. 2 days later he tells me he cheated on me and wants a divorce. he has since (2 weeks) been really cruel, cussed at me, told me he was going to file kidnapping on me, and has generally acted like i am a doormat. the other woman even contacted me and told me she is going to be my children's stepmother. i know that the affair was not very long because he met her 3 months ago. i don't know what has happened to my husband. i cannot eat or sleep and only have a sister with minimal finances. i completely alone and scared. i needed help because i don't know what to do. he filed for a divorce with a lawyer. so 3 days later a friend told me about a spell caster prophet.chasus@yahoo.com, i contacted him and told him my problem and what i wanted and after 3 days he brought my husband back and made my husband a changed man, he is now a good man.

What a beautiful and wonderful testimony. Sometime things you don't believe can just happen. My name is Adams BERCHAR . Am 25 years old i got married at the age of 24 i have only one child and i was living happily. After one year of my marriage my husband behavior became so strange and i don't really understand what was going on, he packed out of the house to another woman i love him so much that i never dream's of losing him, i try my possible best to make sure that my husband get back to me but all to no avail i cry and i cry seeking for help. i discussed it with my best friend and she promise to help me he told me of a man called Dr. PAUL , he is a very great man and a real man that can be trusted and there is nothing concerning love issues he cannot do that is why they call him Dr. PAUL . I contacted his email address.And i told him everything that happen all he told me that i should not worry that all my problems will be solved immediately. He told me what to do to get my husband back and i did, he said after One hour my husband will come back to me and start begging, it really happen i was very surprise and very, very happy our relationship was now very tight and we both live happily again. So my advice for you now is to contact this same email address is salvationlovespell@gmail.com or visit his web site http://salvationlovespellforallnation.webs.com/

my name is Monica After being in relationship with kelly for 3 years,he broke up
with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in
vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I
begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I
explained my problem to someone online and she suggested that I should
rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring
him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no
choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there
was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my
ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and
surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4pm. My ex called me, I
was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was
so sorry for everything that happened, that he wanted me to return to
him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him, that
was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have
made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I
would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only
real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem and
who is different from all the other ones out there. Anybody could need
the help of the spell caster, his email is dr.areghanspellhome@gmail.com
you can email him if you need his assistance in your relationship or
any other problem

I am MISS TRACY FROM UNITED STATE, and email
is tracydesmond144@gmail.com.I just want to share my experience and
testimony here.. i was married for 6 years to
my husband and all of a sudden, another woman
came into the picture.. he started halting me
and he was abusive. but i still loved him with all
my heart and wanted him at all cost…then he
filed for divorce. my whole life was turning
apart and i didn’t know what to do .he moved
out of the house and abandoned the kids.. so
someone told me about trying spiritual means to

I am MISS TRACY FROM UNITED STATE, and email
is tracydesmond144@gmail.com.I just want to share my experience and
testimony here.. i was married for 6 years to
my husband and all of a sudden, another woman
came into the picture.. he started halting me
and he was abusive. but i still loved him with all
my heart and wanted him at all cost…then he
filed for divorce. my whole life was turning
apart and i didn’t know what to do .he moved
out of the house and abandoned the kids.. so
someone told me about trying spiritual means to
get my husband back and introduced me to a
spell caster…so i decided to try it reluctantly.
although i didn’t believe in all those things…
then when he did the love and return spell,
after 2days, my husband came back and was
pleading. he had realized his mistakes. I just
couldn’t believe it..anyways we are back
together now and we are happy. in case anyone
needs this man, his email address is drogbefunspelltemple@gmail.com

THE GREAT Dr OBEHI INEGBEDION WHO BROUGHT MY HUSBAND BACK TO ME . My name is Mandy Buyukolme. My husband and I have been living a very happy and lovely life. So as time went on, I began to notice this strange attitude that he was possessing. He was now having another girl friend called Jane, to the extent that he was no longer picking up my calls, and he was not even sleeping in my house anymore because of this new girl friend. I became confused and didn’t know what to do . So i became worried and stranded, , because I have never experienced a thing like this before in my life. So I decided to visit a spell caster online, to see if he can help me out. So immediately I went to the internet, where I saw an amazing testimony of a spell caster who brought someone’s ex lover back Dr.OBEHI INEGBEDION so I email him with his email: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com immediately and I explained to him all my problems and immediately he reply to me that it will be very easy for him to solve, i have been helping people with situation like the one i have. And he also gave me some proof to be really sure of his work, and he assured me that my husband will come back to me immediately he is through with the spell casting. And also he told me to put all my trust in him, and I really believe him. So it was 9:00 am on the next morning, when I was about going to work, when i received my husband’s call, and he told me that he was coming back home , and he apologized to me, and told me that he is very sorry for the pain that he has cost me. And after some minutes later, he really came back home, and that was how we continued our marriage with lots of love and happiness again, and our love was now stronger than how it were before. And he also told me that once my heart desire has been granted unto me that i should go and testify of his work right here on the internet. Right now I am the happiest woman on earth today as I am writing this testimony, and I want to really thank ” Dr OBEHI INEGBEDION” for bringing back my husband, and for bringing joy and love to my life. My advice for you out there who your husband or your wife is acting strange or behaving the same way like this, or you have any problem with your relationship or anything related to do with spell casting, is for you to go and visit this VIA email: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com , and i assure you that he will be of help to you, and I am 90% sure that he will solve it out. Email him: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com

What a beautiful and wonderful testimony. Sometime things you don't believe can just happen. My name is tanya willians . Am 25 years old i got married at the age of 24 i have only one child and i was living happily. After one year of my marriage my husband behavior became so strange and i don't really understand what was going on, he packed out of the house to another woman i love him so much that i never dream's of losing him, i try my possible best to make sure that my husband get back to me but all to no avail i cry and i cry seeking for help. i discussed it with my best friend and she promise to help me he told me of a man called Dr. PAUL , he is a very great man and a real man that can be trusted and there is nothing concerning love issues he cannot do that is why they call him Dr. PAUL . I contacted his email address.And i told him everything that happen all he told me that i should not worry that all my problems will be solved immediately. He told me what to do to get my husband back and i did, he said after One hour my husband will come back to me and start begging, it really happen i was very surprise and very, very happy our relationship was now very tight and we both live happily again. So my advice for you now is to contact this same email address is salvationlovespell@gmail.com or visit his web site http://salvationlovespellforallnation.webs.com/

My name is williams martinez.I do not know how to thank Dr. Trust for bringing happiness back to my family. i do really wanna tell the whole world that there is a spell caster called Dr.Trust that is so real and genuine. I never believed in any of these things but when i lose my wife for 4 years, i required help until i found a great spell caster, and he cast a love spell for me, and he assured me that I will get my wife back in just 48hours but i was in doubt, and after the spell has been cast, 48hours later, just as the spell caster said, my phone rang, and surprisingly it was my wife who has not called me for the past 4 years, and she made an apology for the pain she has caused me and she told me that she is ready to come back home for me. Dr.Trust really made her to know how much i loved and needed her. And he also opened her eyes to picture how much love we have to share together. With this testimony right now i am the happiest man on earth and our love is now stronger than how it was even before. I will keep sharing this testimony all over the world. All thanks goes to Dr.Trust for the good work that he has done for me and people he has helped. Believe him and do all he ask you to do and never doubt him in any way.via Ultimatespellcast@yahoo.com or Ultimatespellcast@hotmail.com tel: +2348156885231
