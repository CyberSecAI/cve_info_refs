```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Komodia Redirector SDK, used by multiple applications, installs a non-unique root CA certificate and private key. Additionally, the SSL validation performed by Komodia itself is broken.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Installation of non-unique root CA certificates and private keys across multiple applications.",
    "Broken SSL validation in Komodia's SSL Digestor module, allowing self-signed certificates to be trusted.",
       "The private key used to sign certificates is easily obtainable, often hard-coded and sometimes available in plaintext or easily decrypted using a known password"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can spoof HTTPS sites and intercept HTTPS traffic without triggering browser certificate warnings, leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by intercepting web traffic.",
    "Exploitation of broken SSL validation to force the client to accept attacker-controlled certificates.",
     "Exploiting the use of the same private key across different installations by using the key to generate fake certificates"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the server (e.g., on a shared WiFi network).",
     "Ability to extract the private key, or the knowledge of the shared key used by the software, to generate fake certificates",
    "Knowledge of the broken SSL validation to use self-signed certificates."
