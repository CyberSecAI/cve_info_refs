{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Telerik Analytics Monitor Library, when built with hardware support for OpenSSL, attempts to load several third-party DLLs (csunsapi.dll, swift.dll, nfhwcrhk.dll, and surewarehook.dll) at runtime. These DLLs are not distributed with the library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DLL hijacking",
      "Uncontrolled search path element"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can place malicious DLLs with the names of the missing DLLs, causing them to be loaded instead of the intended (or absent) ones. This allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the vulnerable Telerik library.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to place the malicious DLLs in a location where the application will search when trying to load the missing DLLs. This could be a directory the application has write access to, or a shared network path.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have write access to a directory in the DLL search path of the vulnerable application. This usually means having a foothold on the target system. If exploited within ICS, significant access can be achieved."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "Telerik Analytics Monitor Library versions before 3.2.125 (specifically version 3.2.96)"
  ],
    "more_details": "The vulnerability exists because OpenSSL was built with hardware support, which is not a standard configuration. The affected Telerik Analytics Monitor Library DLLs are named EQATEC.Analytics.Monitor.Win32_vc100.dll (for 32-bit systems) and EQATEC.Analytics.Monitor.Win32_vc100-x64.dll (for 64-bit systems), but report file version 1.0.0.1 instead of the correct 3.2.x.",
  "resolution": "Update to Telerik Analytics Monitor Library version 3.2.125 or later. Telerik recommends updating to version 3.2.129."
