## 3. Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
<http://www.wireshark.org/download.html>.

### 3.1. Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the [download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty)
on the Wireshark web site.

## 4. File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

## 5. Known Problems

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
([Bug 1419](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1419))

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.

Capture filters aren’t applied when capturing from named pipes.
([Bug 1814](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1814))

Filtering tshark captures with read filters (-R) no longer works.
([Bug 2234](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2234))

([Win64 development page](http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/Win64))

Resolving ([Bug 9044](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9044)) reopens ([Bug 3528](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3528)) so that Wireshark
no longer automatically decodes gzip data when following a TCP stream.

Application crash when changing real-time option.
([Bug 4035](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4035))

Hex pane display issue after startup.
([Bug 4056](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4056))
