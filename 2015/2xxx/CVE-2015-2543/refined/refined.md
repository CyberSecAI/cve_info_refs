- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sanitization of email content, leading to HTML injection possibilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform HTML injection attacks on affected systems, and attempt to trick the user into disclosing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted email to a user via OWA, enticing them to click a malicious URL within the email.
    - Hosting a malicious website designed to appear legitimate, convincing the user to visit it and interact with malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated access to send emails through Exchange Server is required.
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL or HTML content.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to click on the crafted URL or interact with the malicious content.
