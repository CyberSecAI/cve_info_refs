## Vulnerability Information

## Active Directory Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2535

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Active Directory when an authenticated attacker creates multiple machine accounts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the Active Directory service to become non-responsive.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have valid credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple machine accounts, resulting in denial of service. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how machine accounts are created.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may apply in your situation:

* To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have an account that has privileges to join machines to the domain. If an attacker cannot join new machines to the domain, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.

### Workarounds
