  "CVE-2015-2696": {
    "description": "lib/gssapi/krb5/iakerb.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.14 relies on an inappropriate context handle, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer read and process crash) via a crafted IAKERB packet that is mishandled during a gss_inquire_context call.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The IAKERB mechanism incorrectly replaces its context handle with the krb5 mechanism handle upon establishment. This leads to type confusion when gss_inquire_context() is called on a partially-established context.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect context handling",
        "Type confusion"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (process crash) due to incorrect pointer read during gss_inquire_context()",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, via a crafted IAKERB packet.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted IAKERB packet to the vulnerable service and have some context established.  Authentication might be required.",
        "additional_details": "Applications which call gss_inquire_context() on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API library to read from a pointer using the wrong type. Java server applications using the native JGSS provider are vulnerable to this bug. A carefully crafted IAKERB packet might allow the gss_inquire_context() call to succeed with attacker-determined results, but applications should not make access control decisions based on gss_inquire_context() results prior to context establishment."
