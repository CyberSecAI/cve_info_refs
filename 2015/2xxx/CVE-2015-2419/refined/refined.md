Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the JScript engine handles objects in memory when rendered in Internet Explorer. Specifically, the issue stems from how JScript9, a component of Internet Explorer, manages memory when processing Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue within the JScript engine.
- Improper memory handling: The JScript engine does not handle objects in memory correctly, leading to potential corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- Privilege escalation: The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. By convincing a user to visit the website, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- Embedding in documents: An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control, marked as "safe for initialization", within an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host malicious content: The attacker needs a platform to host a specially crafted website or embed the malicious code in a document.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website, open the malicious document, or interact with compromised content.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability: The attacker needs an understanding of the memory corruption issue in order to craft an effective exploit.
