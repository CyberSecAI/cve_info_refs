  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via two different locations:\n\t1. The 'index.php' page through the 'page', 'c', and 'redirect' parameters in the URL.\n\t2. The main page's search field via the 'searchTerm' parameter in an HTTP POST request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or HTTP POST requests containing the XSS payload. No specific privileges are required, and the attacker can target any user visiting the vulnerable pages."
