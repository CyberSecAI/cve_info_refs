Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2117:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists within the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) component of HP TippingPoint SMS and vSMS. This component is exposed on TCP port 4444.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unauthenticated RMI access:** Requests to the RMI service on port 4444 are not authenticated.
- **Arbitrary class instantiation/upload:** This lack of authentication allows remote attackers to instantiate arbitrary classes or upload and execute arbitrary archives.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote code execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system under the context of the SMS user. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network-based attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
- **RMI service exploitation:** Attackers send malicious requests to the exposed RMI service on TCP port 4444.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target system's port 4444.
- **No authentication required:**  No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- Hewlett-Packard released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- CVSS Score: 9.3, AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C
