- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper optimization of certain parameters by the RyuJIT compiler in Microsoft .NET Framework leading to code generation errors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerability due to flawed code optimization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to host a specially crafted .NET application and convince a user to run it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious .NET application and persuade a user to execute it. They have no way to force execution.
