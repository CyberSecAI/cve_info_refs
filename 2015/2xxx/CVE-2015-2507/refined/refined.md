Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles objects in memory. Specifically, the library fails to properly manage memory allocation and deallocation related to font drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The exploit-db content explicitly mentions a "Use-After-Free condition with printer device contexts", which arises from improper memory management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **System Control:** An attacker could gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** The exploit-db entry classifies the vulnerability type as 'dos' which suggests that the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must first have local access (log on) to the target system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The vulnerability is triggered by running a specially crafted application that exploits the flaw.
- **Printer Device Contexts:** The exploit specifically targets use-after-free vulnerabilities related to printer device contexts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to log on to the target machine.
- **Execution Privileges:** The attacker needs the ability to run an arbitrary application on the target system.
- **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific exploit to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit-db entry confirms that the vulnerability can be triggered on Windows 7 32-bit with Special Pool enabled.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit is available, demonstrating the use-after-free condition.
- The exploit-db describes the type of the exploit as denial of service (dos).

**Additional Notes from Microsoft Security Bulletin:**
- The Microsoft bulletin indicates that the update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ATMFD handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft claims that at the time of the security bulletin's release, there was no indication that the vulnerability had been publicly exploited.
- No workarounds are available

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-2507 is a use-after-free vulnerability within the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library that can be exploited by a local attacker. By executing a specially crafted application, the attacker can trigger a use-after-free condition involving printer device contexts, which leads to an elevation of privilege allowing them to execute code with elevated privileges, and possibly to cause a denial of service.
