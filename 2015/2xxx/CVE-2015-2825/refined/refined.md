  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-2825",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `sam-ajax-admin.php` file of the Simple Ads Manager plugin where the `sam_ajax_upload_ad_image` action does not properly sanitize the file path provided by the user before moving the uploaded file, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary file upload",
        "Lack of path sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files, to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution and full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/simple-ads-manager/sam-ajax-admin.php` with the action set to `upload_ad_image`, an arbitrary `path` parameter, and the malicious file to upload."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific authentication is mentioned in the provided context, suggesting the vulnerability may be exploitable by unauthenticated users."
