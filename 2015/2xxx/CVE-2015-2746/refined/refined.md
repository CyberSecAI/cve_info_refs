Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2746

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a command injection flaw present in the network diagnostics tool of the Websense Appliance Manager. This tool, accessible through a web-based interface, allows users to execute network debugging commands. The `CommandLineServlet` Java Servlet, which is meant to limit the type of commands executed, fails to properly sanitize user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization in the `CommandLineServlet` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Specifically, by providing a crafted payload in the "Destination" parameter of a network diagnostic command (like ping), an attacker can insert shell metacharacters (e.g., `|`) to chain commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the second parameter (e.g., "Destination") of network debugging commands, allowing an attacker to break out of the intended command context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with elevated (root) privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** This could lead to full compromise of the appliance.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be exfiltrated from the appliance. (example given is reading `/etc/shadow`)
*   **Backdoor Creation:** Attackers can create backdoors on the appliance by adding new users or starting reverse shells.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web-based 'command line utility' of the Websense Appliance Manager GUI.
*   **Parameter Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious commands into the `Destination` parameter of the `CommandLineServlet` via a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):** While a direct attack is possible, social engineering tactics like sending a malicious link to an authenticated user could also be used to trigger the execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **Chaining with XSS:** The advisory notes that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) for a more effective, possibly remote unauthenticated attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Websense Appliance Manager's web interface, usually via port 9447.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `Destination` parameter of network diagnostic commands is vulnerable.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** While the advisory suggests that XSS can be used to circumvent authentication, it is not explicitly stated that authentication is not required. It's implied that if using social engineering, the victim needs to be authenticated for the attack to work via the social engineered method.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
*   Websense Triton v7.8.3
*   Websense appliance modules V-Series v7.7
* Other versions may also be affected

**Fix:**
*   Websense released hotfix 02 for Websense Triton v7.8.4 which addresses this vulnerability.
*   The issue is also resolved in TRITON APX Version 8.0.

**Technical Details:**

The proof-of-concept (PoC) provided demonstrates how to read the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file:

```
https://host:9447/appmng/servlet/CommandLineServlet?type=exec&uuid=asdfasdf&module=na1&command=ping&Destination=127.0.0.1'|cat%20/etc/shadow'
```

This URL shows how the pipe character `|` is used to chain the ping command with `cat /etc/shadow`, and thus execute `cat /etc/shadow` which returns sensitive system information.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to run other arbitrary commands such as `adduser` or `nc` to create a backdoor or start a reverse shell.
