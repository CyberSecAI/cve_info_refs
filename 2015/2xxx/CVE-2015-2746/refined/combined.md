## Abstract

A command injection vulnerability was found in Websense Appliance Manager that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the appliance. This issue can be combined with other vulnerabilities, like Cross-Site Scripting, to perform a remote unauthenticated attacks to compromise the appliance.

## Tested versions

This issue was discovered on Websense Triton v7.8.3 and Websense appliance modules V-Series v7.7. Other versions may be affected as well.

## Fix

Websense released hotfix 02 for Websense Triton v7.8.4 in which this issue is fixed. More information can be found on the vendor's website.

This issue is resolved in TRITON APX Version 8.0. More information about the fixed can be found at the following location:
<https://support.forcepoint.com/KBArticle?id=Vulnerabilities-resolved-in-TRITON-APX-Version-8-0>

## Introduction

[Websense Data Security Suite](http://www.websense.com/content/data-security-suite-features.aspx) contains three modules - Data Security Gateway, Data Discover, and Data Endpoint - that can help manage the risk of losing your data to malicious users or accidental misuse.

The Websense Appliance Manager GUI has a web-based 'command line utility' that provides the ability to execute various network debugging commands, which can be run on any module; Appliance Controller, Content Gateway, Web Security, Network Agent, Email Security Gateway. This command line utility is affected by command injection that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the appliance. This issue can be combined with other vulnerabilities, like Cross-Site Scripting, to perform a remote unauthenticated attacks to compromise the appliance.

## Details

The `CommandLineServlet` Java Servlet is responsible for enforcing limitations on the type of network debugging commands users are allowed to run using the GUI. An attacker is able to bypass these limitations by breaking out of any network diagnostics command that requires a second parameter (in this example *Destination*). This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. For example, the pipe character (|) is used to redirect the output from one process into the input of another, enabling multiple commands to be chained together. An attacker can leverage this behavior to execute any available system command (such as `adduser` or `nc` to start a reverse shell). The output is returned to the user, the commands are executed with elevated privileges (`root`).

With a little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat), an attacker may trick authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on behalf of the attacker. A more effective attack would be to abuse other Websense vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting.

The following proof of concept will return the contents of `/etc/shadow` on affected appliances:

[https://host:9447/appmng/servlet/CommandLineServlet?type=exec&uuid=asdfasdf&module=na1&command=ping&Destination=127.0.0.1'|cat%20/etc/shadow'](https://host:9447/appmng/servlet/CommandLineServlet?type=exec&uuid=asdfasdf&module=na1&command=ping&Destination=127.0.0.1'%7Ccat%20/etc/shadow')

Other attack scenarios are also possible, like creating a backdoor account on the appliance.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
