Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2982

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the `admin.php` file of the Photo Gallery CMS. Additionally, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was identified, along with an XSS vulnerability caused by `jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js`. However, the CVE specifically refers to the XSS in admin.php

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS in `admin.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in `admin.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's web browser who is accessing the application. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing of sensitive information like session cookies
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to inject malicious script via the `admin.php` file, which is then stored and executed when a user visits the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to inject the malicious script to the admin.php, likely needing to be an authenticated user with access to the vulnerable functionality.
*   The attacker can use a CSRF attack against a logged-in administrator, to inject the malicious code.
*   The attacker needs to induce users to visit the affected page/functionality in order to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 1.0.1 and earlier of the Photo Gallery CMS.
*   The vendor has released a patch by updating the `admin.php` file.
*   The vendor also mentioned a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability with the XSS in jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js.
*   The XSS vulnerability via lightbox is only exploitable if lightbox is enabled, not when using pop-up.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yuji Tounai of NTT Com Security(Japan) KK.
