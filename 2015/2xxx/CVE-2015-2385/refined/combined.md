## Security Update for Internet Explorer (3076321)

Published: July 22, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer, VBScript, and JScript handle objects in memory
* Helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the CFG security feature
* Preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes
* Adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer
* Helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature
* Helping to ensure cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer
* Helping to restrict what information is returned to external stylesheets
* Helping to ensure that file paths are properly validated before returning file data to the user
* Helping to ensure that requests for module resources are properly validated in Internet Explorer

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## VBScript Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2372

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the [VBScript](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) engine, when rendered in Internet Explorer, handles objects in memory. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handles objects in memory.

## Internet Explorer XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2398

An XSS filter bypass vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer disables an HTML attribute in otherwise appropriately filtered HTTP response data. The vulnerability could allow initially disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker could post on a website specially crafted content that is designed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would then have to convince the user to view the content on the affected website. If the user then browses to the website, the XSS filter disables HTML attributes in the specially crafted content, creating a condition that could allow malicious script to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause script code to run on another user's system in the guise of a third-party website. Such script code would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party website, and could take any action on the user's system that the third-party website was permitted to take. The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked a hypertext link, either in an HTML email or if the user visited an attacker's website or a website containing content that is under the attackerâs control. Any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations and terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2402

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. An attacker could then leverage these privileges with another vulnerability to run arbitrary code with medium integrity level privileges (permissions of the current user).

This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit this vulnerability to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2402](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2402) | No | No |

## JScript9 Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE -2015-2419

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the JScript engine, when rendered in Internet Explorer, handles objects in memory. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the JScript scripting engine handles objects in memory.

## Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-2421

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer fails to use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user to be logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, and then browse to a malicious site. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass | [CVE-2015-2421](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2421) | Yes | No |

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in Internet Explorer:

* CVE-2015-1729

  An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, which could allow an attacker to gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.
* CVE-2015-2410

  An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle requests from external stylesheets, which could allow an attacker to detect the existence of specific files on the user's computer. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to restrict what information is returned to external stylesheets.
* CVE-2015-2412

  An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly validate file paths, which could allow an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that file paths are properly validated before returning file data to the user.
* CVE-2015-2413

  An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle requests for module resources, which could allow an attacker to detect the existence of specific files on the user's computer. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that requests for module resources are properly validated in Internet Explorer.
* CVE-2015-2414

  An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle cached image information, which could allow an attacker to gain access to information about the user's browsing history. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that these vulnerabilities would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but they could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:
