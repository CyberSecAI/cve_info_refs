{
  "CVE-2015-2152": {
    "Description": "Xen 4.5.x and earlier enables certain default backends when emulating a VGA device for an x86 HVM guest qemu even when the configuration disables them, which allows local guest users to obtain access to the VGA console by (1) setting the DISPLAY environment variable, when compiled with SDL support, or connecting to the VNC server on (2) ::1 or (3) 127.0.0.1, when not compiled with SDL support.",
    "Root cause": "The libxl toolstack library does not explicitly disable default VGA backends (SDL or VNC) when they are not enabled in the guest configuration. This leads to an unexpected backend being started.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper initialization of data structures in the VGA emulation code.",
      "Failure to respect disabled VGA console backends in guest configurations."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can gain unauthorized access to a guest's VGA console, potentially leading to further privilege escalation or attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "For qemu-xen compiled without SDL support, an attacker can connect to the VNC server running on IPv6 or IPv4 localhost.",
      "For qemu compiled with SDL support, an attacker can control the DISPLAY environment variable of the toolstack process creating the VM."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the domain 0 hosting the VM or control over the DISPLAY variable of the toolstack process creating the VM."
  }
