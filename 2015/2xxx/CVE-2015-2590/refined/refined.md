**CVE-2015-2590**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability exists in the Libraries component of Oracle Java SE. This vulnerability involves a deserialization issue within `ObjectInputStream.readSerialData()`.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Improper deserialization of data from serialized input, leading to potential bypass of Java sandbox restrictions.
*   **Impact:**  A successful attack may lead to unauthorized Operating System takeover, including arbitrary code execution. This can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks using unspecified vectors related to Libraries component.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no authentication required and low attack complexity.

**CVE-2015-2596**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability within the Hotspot component of Oracle Java SE.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Unspecified flaw related to the Hotspot component.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized modification of Java-accessible data, impacting data integrity.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks via unspecified vectors related to Hotspot.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with a medium attack complexity, no authentication is required.

**CVE-2015-2597**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability in the Install component of Oracle Java SE.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Unspecified flaw in the install component that requires a local logon to Operating System.
*   **Impact:** A successful attack may lead to unauthorized Operating System takeover, including arbitrary code execution and affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Local exploitation.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local user is required to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**CVE-2015-2613**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability within the JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) component of Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded. This vulnerability is related to missing EC parameter validation in the ECDH\_Derive() function.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Missing EC parameter validation in cryptographic functions within the JCE, leading to potential information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data, affecting confidentiality.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks via unspecified vectors related to JCE component.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with low attack complexity, no authentication is required.

**Additional observations:**

*   **Multiple Affected Products:** All the vulnerabilities affect various versions of Oracle Java SE, and in some cases, Java SE Embedded and JRockit.
