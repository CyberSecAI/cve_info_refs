Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient input sanitization within the Piwigo administrative backend. Specifically, two vulnerabilities were identified:

1.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `page` parameter in `admin.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before being rendered in the HTML.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The "History" functionality, accessible via `admin.php?page=history`, is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to unsanitized user-supplied data in the `user` parameter within a POST request, which is then directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Reflected XSS:**  The `page` parameter in the admin interface allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code executes in the context of a victim's browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, manipulate the displayed content, or perform other malicious actions within the Piwigo application.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The `user` parameter within the history functionality allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries. This can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, read or modify database records, potentially gain full control of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **XSS:**
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    *   Defacement of the Piwigo admin interface.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
    *   Potential to perform administrative actions on behalf of the victim.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Data breaches through unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Modification or deletion of database records.
    *   Complete compromise of the Piwigo application.
    *   Potential to execute operating system level commands if the database user has appropriate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the `page` parameter and tricks the user into accessing this URL (e.g., through phishing or a malicious link).
2.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a POST request to `admin.php?page=history` with malicious SQL code in the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim (typically an administrator) to click a crafted link.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs network access to the Piwigo instance and the ability to send HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable software is Piwigo version 2.7.3 and prior.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Steffen RÃ¶semann.
*   The vendor released Piwigo 2.7.4 to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The `seclists.org` content provides specific exploit examples for both vulnerabilities, which is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
