Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that arises from Lync Server failing to properly sanitize user-provided content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This occurs when the server does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** If successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute scripts in the user's browser, which could lead to the disclosure of information from web sessions. This could include session cookies, sensitive data displayed on the page, or potentially other sensitive information accessible through the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack Scenario:** The attacker sends an email with a specially crafted URL to the user. If the user clicks the link, the vulnerability is triggered.
- **Web-Based Attack Scenario:** The attacker hosts a website that contains a specially crafted URL. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit this site, typically through an instant message or email link. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used in these attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that triggers the XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker must convince the user to click on this specially crafted link. This can be through social engineering in email, instant messages, or by hosting a malicious website.
- No specific position within the infrastructure is mentioned in the context. It can be an external attacker, assuming they are able to entice the user to click on the crafted URL.
