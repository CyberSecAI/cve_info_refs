Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-2020:

**Root Cause:**

- The MyScript SDK for Android contains a `Serializable` class.
- This class has a `finalize` method that calls a native function.
- The native function is called with an attacker-controlled pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Deserialization Vulnerability:** The core issue is the ability to control the pointer via deserialization of a `Serializable` object.
- **Lack of `transient` Modifier:** A native pointer (`mContext`) within the `Serializable` class is not declared as `transient`, allowing it to be serialized and deserialized, therefore controllable by the attacker.
- **`finalize` Method Misuse:** The `finalize` method, intended for garbage collection cleanup, is being exploited by calling native code with attacker controlled input
- **SWIG Generated Code:** The vulnerability is also present in SWIG generated code where the developer extends/implements `Serializable` interface and the generated wrapper class includes non-transient pointer `swigCPtr`. This pointer then gets used in the `finalize` method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the pointer passed to the native function, a malicious application can achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can be used to gain code execution in the context of other applications or system services, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- **Malware Installation:** This could be used to replace existing apps with malware or modify system configurations.
- **Kernel Code Execution:** On devices with loadable kernel module support, this could lead to kernel code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Malicious apps send serialized malicious object via a Bundle object, to a vulnerable app or service.
- **`Bundle` Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a `Bundle` containing the malicious serialized object. When a vulnerable app touches the bundle, the object gets deserialized.
- **`finalize` Method Trigger:** The garbage collector automatically invokes the `finalize` method of the deserialized object.
- **`writeReplace` method trigger:** The `writeReplace` method can be triggered immediately during serialization of the object instead of relying on the GC to call finalize.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Vulnerable classes can exist in third party SDKs included in apps, making attacks targeted towards those apps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to be able to install and run a malicious Android application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Classes:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and location of the vulnerable `Serializable` class.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Objects:** The attacker needs to be able to create a serialized object that will exploit the vulnerability during deserialization.
- **Ability to send crafted intents:** The attacker needs to send a crafted intent with the malicious `Bundle` to the targeted application/service.

**Additional Details:**

- The research paper also discusses techniques for bypassing ASLR, controlling program counter, finding writable function pointers, stack pivoting and evading SELinux, using the same vulnerability and a variety of ROP gadgets, making the attack more powerful.

- The vulnerability was found in multiple popular SDKs such as: Jumio, MetaIO SDK, PJSIP PJSUA2, GraceNote GNSDK, and ArcGis Runtime SDK and not just MyScript as the CVE description implies. The root cause in most of them was SWIG generated code.

- The paper provides a detailed description of the vulnerability and exploitation techniques and also lists suggested mitigations, such as lazy initialization of `Bundle` objects, more secure function pointer handling, and more secure SWIG generated code.

This vulnerability is a high severity issue that allows for remote code execution and privilege escalation.
