## Vulnerabilities in XML Core Services Could Allow Information Disclosure (3080129)

Published: August 11, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow information disclosure by either exposing memory addresses if a user clicks a specially crafted link or by explicitly allowing the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to click a specially crafted link. An attacker would have to convince users to click the link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message.

This security update is rated Important for the following software:

* Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0 and Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 on all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Windows 10, which is not affected.
* Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0 on Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3
* Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0 on Microsoft InfoPath 2007 Service Pack 3

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft XML Core Services returns data requested by the API, and by configuring MSXML to use more secure network protocols by default. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3080129](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3080129).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Some versions of Microsoft XML Core Services are included with Microsoft Windows; others are installed with non-operating system software from Microsoft or third-party providers. Some are also available as separate downloads. The following table shows which versions of Microsoft XML Core Services are included with Microsoft Windows and which are installed with the installation of additional Microsoft or third-party software.

| **Operating System** | **MSXML 3.0 and MSXML 6.0** | **MSXML 5.0** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Vista | Shipped with operating system | Installed with additional software |
| Windows Server 2008 | Shipped with operating system | Installed with additional software |
| Windows 7 | Shipped with operating system | Installed with additional software |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | Shipped with operating system | Installed with additional software |
| Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 | Shipped with operating system | Installed with additional software |

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple MSXML Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when [Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) explicitly allows the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could decrypt portions of encrypted network information traffic.

In a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack scenario, an attacker could force an encrypted SSL 2.0 session and then decrypt portions of encrypted network information traffic. This update resolves the issue by configuring MSXML to use more secure network protocols by default instead of SSL 2.0.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MSXML Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2434) | No | No |
| MSXML Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2471](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2471) | No | No |

## MSXML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2440

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when [Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) exposes memory addresses not intended for public disclosure. An attacker could combine this information disclosure vulnerability to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read private data. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but the attacker could use it to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially-crafted website that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. However, an attacker would have no way to force a user to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would typically have to convince a user to either click a link in an email message or a link in an Instant Messenger request that would then take the user to the website. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft XML Core Services returns data requests.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
