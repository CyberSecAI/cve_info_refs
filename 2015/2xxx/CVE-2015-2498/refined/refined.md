Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-2498:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically within the usage of `CTableSectionRowsCollectionCacheItem` objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Memory Access:** By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force an out-of-bounds memory access. This can lead to memory corruption.
- **Memory Corruption Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is categorized as a memory corruption vulnerability, meaning that it can corrupt memory in a way that leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, an attacker could gain complete control over the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious File:** The user must open a malicious file.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that host user-provided content/advertisements.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must visit the attacker's malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or provide a malicious file, and then trick the user to visit it or open it.
- No special network access is required beyond the ability to host a webpage and have a user visit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (7, 8, 9, 10, and 11).
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's original release.
- Microsoft has released an update to correct this vulnerability.
- The ZDI advisory also confirms that this vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating a document's elements.

This information provides more detail than the original CVE description, as it includes the specific object involved (`CTableSectionRowsCollectionCacheItem`), the mechanism of the memory corruption (out-of-bounds access), and a more detailed attack vector description.
