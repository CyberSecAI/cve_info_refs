Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that function names within Lua error backtraces in the Scribunto extension were not being sanitized before being displayed to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through the function names in Lua error backtraces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attack:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which would then execute within the context of a user's browser when viewing the error backtrace. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user must trigger a Lua error, which causes a backtrace to be displayed. This typically involves interacting with a Scribunto module that contains malicious function names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or modify Scribunto modules to include malicious function names (or have access to a vulnerable module).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability, only a user viewing a page where the error is displayed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by MediaWiki user Jackmcbarn.
- The fix involves sanitizing the content of Lua backtraces to prevent the injection of malicious code. This change was applied in Scribunto extension.
- Patches were created for MediaWiki versions 1.23, 1.24, and master branches.
- The provided example code shows how malicious function names can be injected into a Lua module which can lead to XSS.
```lua
local p = {}

p['<script>alert("XSS")</script>'] = function()
	error('CLICK ME')
end

function p.main(frame)
	p['<script>alert("XSS")</script>']()
end

return p
```
- The fix sanitizes backtraces so they can contain wikitext but not HTML.
