{
  "CVE-2015-2816": {
    "Root cause": "Missing authorization check in SAP Afaria 7 XcListener service.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing authorization check (CWE-862)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can access the service without authorization, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, and denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, a specially crafted request can crash the Sybase SQL Anywhere process on the server, resulting in a DoS.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is remotely exploitable if the XcListener port (3005) is exposed externally. Otherwise, it is exploitable locally on the machine.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the XcListener service. If the service is exposed externally, the attacker can be remote. If not, the attacker needs to have local access to the machine."
