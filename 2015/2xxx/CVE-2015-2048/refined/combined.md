**Publication ID:** SAP10049

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 12 February 2015 9:53 GMT

**Last updated on:** 20 March 2015 5:44 GMT

**Overview**

D-Link has received a report that a unreferenced webpage on the DCS-931L allows an authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files. By allowing the attacker to specify the file location to write on the device, the attacker has the ability to upload new functionality to the camera.

CERT Vulnerability :: [CERT VU#377348](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/377348)

NIST Vulnerability ID :: [CVE-2015-2049](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2049)

**Details**

The DCS-931L has a hidden webpage at http://<device IP>/uploadfile.htm which allows a user to upload an arbitrary file, to a location of their choosing on the DCS-931L.  By overwriting system files an attacker could dramatically change the functionality of the camera, up to and including running arbitrary binaries provided by an attacker.

This is an authenticated attack, however the DCS-931L does not have a password in it's default state.  The DCS-931L will require you to configure a device password if you register it for use with the mydlink service.

This attack is normally a local attack, however it could be used as part of a CSRF attack against an authorized and authenticated user to upload a file of an attacker's choice.
