Hi,
this was reported by Red Hat:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=852481>

I'm afraid there are no further details, but maybe you can
get in touch with upstream; I suppose Red Hat had contacted
them and it might already be fixed by now?

Cheers,
        Moritz

Hi Moritz,

I have been trying to find out more about this security issue but so far
without having any luck. Apparently the bug was reported 2,5 years ago
but there are no hints at redhat's bug tracker which could help us or
would at least point us to the affected code in question. Why
did they escalate this to seclists.org just now?

<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/447>

I checked upstream's git repository but I could not find any commits
related to some kind of security issue with the GIF encoder or the
playback tool.

<https://git.gnome.org/browse/byzanz/>

However I know for sure, if upstream released a fix it would be
included in Debian. The package is up to date and only some minor language
updates from November 2014 are currently missing.

I couldn't find anything useful at Fedora either.

<http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/byzanz.git/>

I will keep an eye on this Red Hat bug report but at the moment I just
have not enough information to work on something.

Regards,

Markus

They did some spring cleaning of embargoed issues which fell through the cracks.

Let's add Murray McAllister (the original reporter) to CC:
Murray, can you provide additional information on the
byzanz issue discovered by you, was it forwarded upstream?

Cheers,
        Moritz

A short summary about what happened so far:

I asked for additional information by sending an e-mail to Red Hat's bug
tracker.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=852481>

I was contacted by Stefan Cornelius from the Red Hat security team and
he sent me a reproducer for this vulnerability. This one is not intended
for public use, so interested parties who would like to fix this issue
should contact

	secalert@redhat.com

and ask for it there.

I have reported this issue upstream.

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749674>

Red Hat has already closed this bug report again and marked it as
"wontfix". This means they "deem the overall real world risks to
be very low and have no immediate plans to fix the issue."

I think it is quite unlikely that someone is able to exploit this
vulnerability remotely. It might be possible to send someone a specially
crafted .byzanz file and possibly execute arbitrary code. The producer
which I have received causes a segmentation fault.

However .byzanz files are only used for debugging purposes and more
targeted at developers or benchmarks. A user also has to convert the
.byzanz file to a gif file with byzanz playback like this

	byzanz-playback test.byzanz test.gif

I haven't heard anything from upstream so far. I consider the overall
risk being low but this is still a bug that should be fixed. If someone
can come up with a patch, please let me know.

Markus
