Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in OpenStack Nova's live migration process. When a live migration fails, the `lun-id` information in the `connection_info` column of the `block_device_mapping` table isn't properly rolled back. This leads to inconsistencies in the mapping between virtual machines (VMs) and their attached volumes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent `lun-id` Rollback:** The core issue is the failure to revert changes made to volume connection information (`lun-id`) when a live migration fails.
*   **`lun-id` Mismapping:** Due to the lack of rollback, a VM can be associated with incorrect volume mappings. This can result in the VM accessing volumes it is not authorized to access.
*   **Use of dynamic `lun-id`:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that `lun-id` is not a unique identifier and can change during attach/detach operations. The dynamic nature of `lun-id` values makes it susceptible to errors and manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Volume Access:** An attacker can potentially gain access to volumes that do not belong to their VM. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and other security risks.
*   **Data Instability:** Mismapping can potentially lead to filesystem corruption and data loss, as a VM might interact with the wrong storage volume.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Access to other VMs volumes can lead to information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Live Migration Failure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by triggering a live migration failure. There are various ways to achieve this such as:
    *   Causing errors during the live migration process, such as high memory usage or network disconnections, to make migration fail.
    *   Exploiting existing bugs in Havana (and potentially other versions) related to multipath rescan or volume detach issues that could cause the live migration to fail.
*  **Direct Database Manipulation:** An attacker who gains administrative access to the Nova database can directly modify the `lun-id` information in the `block_device_mapping` table. This can then be exploited after a VM reboot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to initiate live migrations of their VM.
*   **Ability to Trigger Live Migration Failures:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the live migration to fail, either by exploiting known bugs, creating high resource usage in the VM during migration, or potentially through network manipulation.
*   **(Optional) Administrative Access:**  While not required, administrative access to the Nova database would allow for direct manipulation of the data related to the vulnerable logic, making exploitation more reliable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple OpenStack versions, including Havana, Icehouse, and Juno.
*   The vulnerability was initially considered a bug with security consequences rather than a vulnerability, but was later reclassified as a vulnerability as it was determined that an attacker didn't need to trigger a live migration failure to exploit the issue.
*   The fix involves refreshing the connection information on the source host during `_rollback_live_migration`, ensuring that the `lun-id` is correctly rolled back.
