The document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-2376, which is a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

**CVE-2015-2376:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability arises from the way Microsoft Office handles objects in memory. Specifically, the document states "Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory."

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user. With administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, install software, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

*   **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted Microsoft Office files. These files can be delivered through email (where the user is convinced to open the attachment) or through a website (where the user is convinced to visit a malicious site and open the file).

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file. They also need to convince the user to open this file, either through social engineering or by hosting the file on a website and tricking the user into visiting the site.

The document also mentions other CVEs related to Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, including ASLR bypass and DLL loading issues, but CVE-2015-2376 is specifically a memory corruption vulnerability.
