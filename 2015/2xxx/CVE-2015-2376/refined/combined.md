## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3072620)

Published: July 14, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Word 2007
* Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, Microsoft Word 2010
* Microsoft Excel 2013, Microsoft PowerPoint 2013, Microsoft Word 2013
* Microsoft Excel 2013 RT, Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 RT, Microsoft Word 2013 RT
* Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011
* Microsoft Excel Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Word Viewer
* Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007
* Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010
* Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles files in memory, by correcting how Excel handles the loading of certain specially crafted binaries, and by correcting how memory information is disclosed. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3072620](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3072620).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.

## Microsoft Excel ASLR Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2375

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel when memory is released in an unintended manner. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, and potentially allow remote code execution. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this security feature bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the ASLR security feature.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel (.xls) file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel (.xls) file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel (.xls) file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how memory information is disclosed.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Microsoft Excel DLL Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2378

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Excel improperly handles the loading of dynamic link library (DLL) files. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target userâs current working directory. The attacker would then have to convince the user to launch a program designed to load a trusted DLL, but which mistakenly loads the malicious specially crafted DLL file. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Excel handles the loading of certain specially crafted binaries.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
