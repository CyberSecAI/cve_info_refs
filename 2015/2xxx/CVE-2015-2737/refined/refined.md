{
  "CVE-2015-2737": {
    "description": "The rx::d3d11::SetBufferData function in the Direct3D 11 implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird before 38.1 reads data from uninitialized memory locations, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The `rx::d3d11::SetBufferData` function in Firefox does not properly check the return value of the `ID3D11DeviceContext::Map` function. If this mapping fails, an uninitialized memory location on the stack called `mappedResource` is used, which may lead to memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory use",
      "Improper error handling",
	  "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must entice a user to view a specially crafted web page that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the function rx::d3d11::SetBufferData does not check the return value of the Windows API call ID3D11DeviceContext::Map. When this API fails, the mappedResource struct will not be initialized, and the program will access the uninitialized memory. This is a stack-based vulnerability, so exploitation could be straightforward if an attacker can cause the API call to fail consistently."
