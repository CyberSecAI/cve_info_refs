Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2125

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML input, specifically the processing of external entities. This allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the application's vulnerability to XXE attacks. The application parses XML input and processes external entities without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can read local files from the server where HP WebInspect is running. This is achieved by defining external entities that point to local file paths. Example shows reading `/C:/Windows/system.ini`.
*   **NTLM Hash Capture:** Attackers can force the server to attempt an SMB connection to an attacker-controlled server, which can be used to capture NTLM hashes of the user account running the vulnerable application, this example uses `\\attacker\path\file.txt`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via an HTTP POST request that includes a malicious XML payload within a hidden form field named `payload`. This suggests that any part of the application that processes arbitrary XML input is vulnerable.
*   **External Entity Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting XML payloads that define external entities to access local files or trigger network requests. The provided examples use both out-of-band (OOB) and SMB techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Attacker Controlled Server/Share:** To exploit the vulnerability completely, the attacker needs an accessible server to host the malicious file (`file.xml`) for the OOB technique, or a server share to capture NTLM hashes.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** HP WebInspect versions 10.4, 10.3, 10.2, 10.1, 10.0, 9.x, 8.x, and 7.x are all affected.
*   **Exploitation Context:** The exploit is triggered when profiling or scanning an application using vulnerable versions of HP WebInspect.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:** The exploit utilizes XML external entities to perform file inclusion and NTLM hash capture. The use of nested entities `%remote;%int;%trick;` allows for more complex attack scenarios.
