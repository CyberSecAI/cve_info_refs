Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the HMI panel handles specific network packets. By sending specially crafted packets to the HMI panel (port 102/tcp), an attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of network packets by the HMI panel. This leads to a denial-of-service condition when crafted packets are sent.
- Specifically, it's a cryptographic issue(CWE-310).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the HMI panel becoming unavailable. This can disrupt operations in industrial environments where these panels are used for control and monitoring.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the HMI panel and the PLC. This allows the attacker to intercept and modify network traffic.
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted network packets over TCP port 102.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the network path between the HMI panel and the PLC.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific, malicious network packets.

**Affected Products:**
- SIMATIC WinCC Comfort Panels
- SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability affects systems using TCP port 102, which is commonly used for industrial communication protocols.
- This vulnerability is related to cryptographic issues.
