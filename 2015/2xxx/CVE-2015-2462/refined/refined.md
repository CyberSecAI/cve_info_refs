    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-2462",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_ad6308d6_20250125_211840.html",
      "root_cause": "The kernel doesn't perform any bounds checking against the 32-bit FDSelect offset specified in the Top DICT, key \"12 37\", and instead uses it directly as an index into a user-mode input data buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "On 32-bit platforms, the controlled offset can be set such that it points into kernel space, resulting in a system bugcheck (denial of service). On 64-bit platforms the exception is handled by ATMFD.DLL exception handler limiting the impact. Potentially allows local kernel memory disclosure.",
        "attack_vector": "Processing a specially crafted OTF font file with a malformed FDSelect offset.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malicious font file. Can be achieved by convincing a user to open a malicious document or visiting a malicious web page."

       "source": "docs.microsoft.com_3a5009e7_20250125_211838.html",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of specially crafted OpenType fonts by the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote code execution vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to entice the user to open malicious file or navigate to a malicious webpage"
