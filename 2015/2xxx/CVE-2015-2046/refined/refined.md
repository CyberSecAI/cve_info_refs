Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-2046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MantisBT Configuration Report (adm\_config\_report.php) did not properly sanitize the `filter_config_id` form variable when saving a filter. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code, into the configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the `filter_config_id` parameter could be manipulated to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Client's Browser:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the browser of any user who views the affected page. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies,
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites,
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user,
    *   Defacing the website content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST/GET Request:** An attacker could inject the malicious script via a POST or GET request to `/adm_config_report.php` by manipulating the `filter_config_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MantisBT instance.
*  **No Authentication Needed**: The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability was initially reported in May 2014. A partial fix was implemented in MantisBT versions 1.2.18, but it was incomplete. The incomplete fix is the reason for the assignment of CVE-2015-2046
*   **Affected Versions:**  The vulnerability affects MantisBT versions 1.2.13 up to 1.3.0-beta.1.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in MantisBT versions 1.2.20 and 1.3.0-beta.2.
*   **CVE-2014-8986 vs CVE-2015-2046:** CVE-2014-8986 was originally assigned to the same vulnerability report. Later, the meaning of CVE-2014-8986 was changed to refer to the portion of the vulnerability that was fixed in 1.2.18. CVE-2015-2046 is specifically for the remaining XSS vulnerability present in versions 1.2.18 and 1.2.19 due to an incomplete fix.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was independently discovered by Paul Richards and FortiGuard Labs.

The provided text details that the vulnerability was not completely fixed in 1.2.18 and 1.2.19. The originally reported issue (CVE-2014-8986) had a partial fix applied, but the core issue of sanitizing `filter_config_id` was not completely addressed, leading to CVE-2015-2046.
