## SUMMARY

#### The following vulnerabilities were found in [Medicomp System’s MEDCIN Engine](http://www.medicomp.com/medcin-engine/) application:

### **CVE-2015-2898,****CVE-2015-2901**

#### Certain remote message parsing functions inside the MEDCIN service do not perform proper bounds checking on incoming data, which allow for specially crafted messages to cause a stack buffer overflow.

### **CVE-2015-2899**

#### Certain remote message parsing functions inside the MEDCIN service do not perform proper bounds checking on incoming data, which allow for specially crafted messages to cause a heap buffer overflow.

### **CVE-2015-2900**

#### A remote message parsing function inside the MEDCIN service does not properly validate a user provided index into memory which allows for a specially crafted message to write data anywhere in memory.

###

### **CVE-2015-6006**

#### Certain remote message parsing functions inside the MEDCIN service improperly truncate user supplied length values which allow for specially crafted messages to cause a heap buffer overflow.

## Medicomp MEDCIN Engine contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#675052

Original Release Date: 2015-10-20 | Last Revised: 2015-10-20

---

### Overview

Medicomp's MEDCIN Engine provide electronic health records (EHR) tools and information to medical professionals. MEDCIN Engine versions before version 2.22.20153.226 are vulnerable to several buffer overflows.

### Description

| Medicomp MEDCIN Engine prior to version 2.22.20153.226 is vulnerable to several buffer overflows and an out-of-bounds write.  [**CWE-121**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow** **-** CVE-2015-2898, CVE-2015-2901An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and cause a stack buffer overflow.The API functions SetGroupSequenceEx's na\_setgroupsequenceex, FormatDate's julptostr, and UserFindingCodes's addtocl are vulnerable, and are identified by CVE-2015-2898. These functions do not properly check input sizes, allowing buffer overflows. This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.The API functions GetProperty's info\_getproperty and UdfCodeList are vulnerable, and are identified by CVE-2015-2901. These functions do not properly check input sizes, allowing buffer overflows. This vulnerability only affects version 2.22.20142.166.[**CWE-122**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow** **-** CVE-2015-2899An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and cause a heap buffer overflow. The QualifierList API function retrieve\_qualifier\_list may be overflowed if a list name is too long. This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.[**CWE-787**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)**: Out-of-bounds Write** **-** CVE-2015-2900An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and may overwrite data in memory. The AddUserFinding API function add\_userfinding2 may be used to overwrite memory. This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.[**CWE-197**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/197.html)**: Numeric Truncation Error**[**CWE-680**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/680.html)**: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow -** CVE-2015-6006An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 that may allow writing to out of bounds memory due to improper integer truncation. AddUserFinding accepts a user-controlled string and uses the length of the string to calculate where in the buffer to place data. If this string is above a length of 0x7fff, it will be truncated to a negative value and allow an attacker to write to memory outside of the bounds of the buffer. An attacker may be able to gain control of the flow of the program. This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.22.20153.223. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker sending a specially crafted packet may be able to overwrite data in memory, cause the software to leak information to the attacker, and/or cause a denial of service. A remote attacker may also be able to execute code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Medicomp has released version 2.22.20153.226 which addresses these issues. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. |
