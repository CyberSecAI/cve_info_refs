### Overview

Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem, versions NCS01-1.0.12 and earlier, contains multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-259**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Password -** CVE-2015-2904  Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem contains multiple hard-coded credentials that enable a user to log into the web administration interface with root privileges.[**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) -** CVE-2015-2905Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem contains a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. Note that in combination with hard-coded credentials, an attacker can reliably establish an active session as part of an attack and therefore does not require a victim to be logged in.The CVSS score below describes CVE-2015-2904. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session or perform actions as an authenticated user. A network-based attacker can take complete control of an affected device. |
