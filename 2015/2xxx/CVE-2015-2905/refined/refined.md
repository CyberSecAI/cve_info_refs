**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem has a global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The modem is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to perform actions on the device as a logged-in user.
- Additionally, a hardcoded password vulnerability (CVE-2015-2904) exists in the same device, which when combined with CSRF, enables the attacker to establish a session without requiring a logged-in user

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.
- A network-based attacker can take complete control of an affected device
- Perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, without needing the user to be logged in.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can induce a victim user (with an active session) to trigger a malicious request.
- The attacker could also establish their own session using hardcoded credentials (CVE-2015-2904)
- Attack is network-based.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to trigger a malicious request or be able to gain access using hardcoded credentials.
- The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the device.
