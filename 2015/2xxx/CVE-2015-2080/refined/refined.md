    "description": "A Security Vulnerability in Jetty 9.2.3.v20140905 through 9.2.8.v20150217 (including 9.3.0.M0 and 9.3.0.M1 currently in beta/milestones) was recently discovered by Gotham Digital Science and Stephen Komal.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by exception handling code that returns data from a shared buffer when illegal characters are present in HTTP header values. This is due to a bad implementation of a feature request for more details on HttpParser parsing errors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage",
       "Improper Error Handling",
      "Use of Shared Buffers without proper sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary data from previous requests and responses submitted to the server by other users. This can lead to the compromise of sensitive data, including cookies, authentication tokens, anti-CSRF tokens, usernames, passwords, and PII.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends carefully crafted HTTP requests with variable-length strings containing illegal characters in header values.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Jetty server."
