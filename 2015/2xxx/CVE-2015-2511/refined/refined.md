Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). Specifically, it arises when the driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability, which occurs when the driver improperly manages memory allocation, deallocation, or access, potentially leading to overwriting of critical data or control flow hijacking.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to escalate their privileges to kernel-mode, the highest level of access, bypassing security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This means that attackers can perform any action they wish on the system.
- **Full System Control:** Gaining kernel-level access enables an attacker to take full control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could install malicious software, view, change, or delete data and create new user accounts with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system. An attacker must have the ability to log on to the target machine.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** Once logged on, the attacker needs to execute a specifically designed application to exploit the memory corruption flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the targeted system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must have the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system, at least at the user level, before they can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `win32k.sys` component.
- The exploit involves a wild write, indicating that the crafted application triggers an out-of-bounds memory write in the kernel.
- The exploit, according to the exploit-db entry, is demonstrated on a 32-bit version of Windows 7 with the Special Pool enabled on win32k.sys, suggesting that this tool may be used by developers for debugging purposes. This indicates a potential vulnerability related to the way this specific driver interacts with memory when the Special Pool is enabled.
