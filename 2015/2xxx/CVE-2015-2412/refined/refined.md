    "root_cause": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly validate file paths, which could allow an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper file path validation in Internet Explorer"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed, specifically the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer. This vulnerability does not allow for code execution or elevation of privileges directly, but the disclosed information could be used to further compromise the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack scenario, where an attacker hosts a website to exploit the vulnerability",
      "Compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content could host malicious content to exploit the vulnerability",
      "Users would need to be convinced to click a link or take other actions that lead them to the attacker controlled content."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to host a malicious website, or compromise a website to include malicious content. The attacker needs to trick a user into viewing the malicious content in Internet Explorer."
