- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `contentURL` parameter of a request to `index.html` is not properly validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper input neutralization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to `index.html` with a malicious `contentURL` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable appliance. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
