Vulnerability: Arbitrary file download
CVE-2015-2996 (same CVE as #8)
Constraints: none; no authentication or any other information needed
(see #5 to obtain the traversal path)
Affected versions: unknown, at least 14.4

GET /sysaid/getGfiUpgradeFile?fileName=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows arbitrary file downloads due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the `fileName` parameter in the `getGfiUpgradeFile` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Path Traversal vulnerability.
**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially revealing sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or even database credentials if they are stored on disk.
**Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/sysaid/getGfiUpgradeFile` endpoint with a `fileName` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special position or capabilities are needed, as this vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.

Vulnerability: Denial of service
CVE-2015-2996 (same CVE as #4)
Constraints: no authentication or any other information needed
Affected versions: unknown, at least 14.4

GET /sysaid/calculateRdsFileChecksum?fileName=../../../../../../dev/zero

This request will cause the cpu to go to 100% and the memory to
balloon for 30+ seconds. Sending lots of requests causes the server to
slow down to a crawl (although it doesn't seem to crash or hang
forever).
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application attempts to calculate a checksum of an arbitrary file specified by the user, without proper validation. By providing a special file like `/dev/zero` as input, the system will be forced to endlessly read from the device, causing excessive resource consumption.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive or slow to a crawl by sending multiple requests, impacting the availability of the service. The server's CPU usage will go to 100%, and memory will increase significantly, potentially leading to performance issues for legitimate users.
**Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/sysaid/calculateRdsFileChecksum` endpoint with a `fileName` parameter pointing to a special device or file like `/dev/zero`.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special position or capabilities are needed as this vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.
