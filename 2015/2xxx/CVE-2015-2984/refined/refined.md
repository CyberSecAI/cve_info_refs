- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the UPnP functionality of the affected I-O DATA LAN routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The devices have a vulnerability in their UPnP implementation, which can be exploited to conduct a DDoS attack. Specifically, the devices act as SSDP reflectors.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The affected devices can be used as SSDP reflectors in a DDoS attack, leading to reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable router which reflects the request to a target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
