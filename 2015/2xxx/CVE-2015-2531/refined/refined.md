Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Skype for Business Server and Lync Server. The jQuery engine within these servers fails to properly sanitize specially crafted content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser through specially crafted content. This occurs because of inadequate sanitization of user inputs within the jQuery engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could execute scripts in a user's browser to obtain information from web sessions.
- Elevation of Privilege: By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code, potentially allowing them to take control of the affected system. This could enable the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: An attacker could send an email containing a specially crafted URL, tricking the user into clicking it.
- Web-Based Attack: An attacker could host a website with a malicious URL or inject such content into compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs that exploit the XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker must convince the user to click on the malicious URL, whether through email, instant messenger, or by visiting a compromised or malicious website. No forced browsing or automatic execution is involved.
- The attacker needs no specific prior privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by updating jQuery in Skype for Business Server and Lync Server to properly sanitize user input.
- The exploitability assessment from the provided table marks this vulnerability with an "Exploitation Unlikely" (3) rating.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important."
- The provided content also lists CVE-2015-2532 and CVE-2015-2536 which are related to XSS vulnerabilities in Lync and Skype for Business servers.
