  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-2449",
      "description": "A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer fails to use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.",
      "root_cause": "Improper implementation of the ASLR security feature.",
      "vulnerability": "ASLR Bypass",
      "impact": "An attacker could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.",
       "attack_vector": "The attacker would need to convince a user to visit a malicious website using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and convince the victim to visit it. The attacker needs to be able to leverage another vulnerability such as a remote code execution vulnerability."
