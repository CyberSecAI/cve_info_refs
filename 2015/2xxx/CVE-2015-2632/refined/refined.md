Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2632:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `LETableReference`'s `verifyLength()` method within the ICU (International Components for Unicode) Layout Engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow:**  The `verifyLength()` method lacks proper checks, allowing for an integer overflow.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The integer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds read, potentially accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JVM memory corruption:** The integer overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds read can lead to memory corruption within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Application crash:**  A specially crafted file, when parsed by an application using ICU, could cause a crash due to the invalid memory access.
- **Information disclosure:** It may also be possible to disclose portions of the application's memory, potentially leaking sensitive information.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** In some cases, arbitrary code execution could be achieved by taking advantage of the memory corruption.
- **Bypass Java sandbox restrictions**: Untrusted Java applets or applications could potentially leverage this vulnerability to bypass Java sandbox limitations.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted files:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted file, particularly font files, which trigger the integer overflow within the ICU layout engine.
- **Untrusted data processing:** Applications using ICU to parse untrusted font data are vulnerable.
- **Network attacks:**  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable since network communication can be used to deliver the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deliver a crafted file:** An attacker needs to be able to supply the specially crafted file to an application that utilizes ICU for font parsing.
- **No authentication needed:** The attack can be executed without any authentication.
- **Network access (for remote attacks):**  Attackers can potentially exploit this vulnerability over a network connection.
