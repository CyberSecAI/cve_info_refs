| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-58

## Mozilla Windows updater can be run outside of application directory

Announced
May 12, 2015
Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 38
* SeaMonkey 2.35
* Thunderbird 38.0.1

### Description

Security researcher **Holger Fuhrmannek** previously reported [CVE-2015-0833](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0833), which was fixed in
[MFSA2015-12](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-12/). That flaw allowed for the updater to load binary DLL format files from
the local working directory or from the Windows temporary directories. During
the fixing of CVE-2015-0833, the need to ensure that updates use the updater.exe
from the application directory was identified to mitigate the potential for
further similar vulnerabilities. This change to updater.exe for Windows systems
has been made in this release.

This issue is specific to Windows and does not affect Linux or
OS X systems.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c0)• 11 years ago |
|  | |

The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll from the update directory, for example while performing an update. That can lead to a privilege escalation while updating without the Mozilla Maintenance Service. I have tested this on win7 pro 32bit with Firefox 25.0.1.
quick poc 1:
1.) copy the updater.exe from Firefox 25.0.1 and create a "bcrypt.dll" file with no content in the same location
2.) start the updater.exe
3.) a error message will occur, because the update tries to load the empty .dll
Also other .dlls are loaded from the working directory but only the bcrypt.dll is loaded while performing an update without the service from the high integrity updater process.

If this is only without using the maintenance service where does privilege escalation come in? Not disputing that this is unintended, just not sure how it gets used in an attack (but maybe I've misunderstood what you're describing)Flags: sec-bounty?

I'm still not getting how this is useful in an attack. If you can copy files around can't you copy or not copy any other file the updater needs or touches?

An attack can look as follows (using firefox):
- an attacker has already compromised a system and wants to get admin rights now
- the attacker puts the updater.exe from the ff directory, an update.status (content: "pending") and update.version (content: "30.0") and a fake bcrypt.dll to
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Mozilla\updates\308046B0AF4A39CB\updates\0
- the attacker sets "using the maintenance service for updating" in the firefox configuration to false if it is enabled
- if the user starts firefox the next time, the update.exe will be execting and an UAC prompt from the updater.exe will appear
- if the user agrees, the attack will be successful, because the bcypt.dll will be executed.

Hi ash,
Would it be possible to give us a dll that launches something like a cmd or calc.exe as high integrity?
We did some previous testing here: (accessible only internally unfortunately)
[https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Ahughes@mozilla.com/DLL\_Hijacking](https://intranet.mozilla.org/User%3AAhughes%40mozilla.com/DLL_Hijacking)
And bcrypt.dll was found to be loaded, but found to not be an exploit because it doesn't launch an elevated cmd in a dll that simply launched a cmd.
Perhaps for example the dll is loaded as a resource dll and no code is executed from it.Flags: needinfo?(ash)

I have created the exploit dll. The exploit dll needs the original dll named "bcrypt\_orig.dll" in the same directory because it forwards the calls to the original dll.
If the exploit dll is now placed in the "\updates\0" directory two cmd windows will appear during an update without the service. The first windows will not be elevated but the second. You will need to close the first cmd windows to see the second.Flags: needinfo?(ash)

Kamil I have a bit of a project for you or someone else on QA if your manager is OK with it.
Could you verify this dll? If it reproduces, which based on [Comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") it will, we should retry all the dlls in the intranet link mentioned in [Comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") with the new PoC dll. We basically need to redo everything in that intranet page but with the new PoC dll.
For what it's worth nothing in the DLL Hijacking intranet link was tested wrong, I just think the PoC differs in some way that we didn't test. So we should re-test with the new PoC for all Dlls and on all platforms.Flags: needinfo?(kamiljoz)

The exploit dll need to export the same functions as the original dll. I think that's the difference between the exploit dll and your dll. My dll is auto generate using this tool <http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16541/Create-your-Proxy-DLLs-automatically>, i only added system('cmd').

Brian, so I ran through the test case following the information added in [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") and [comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") and reproduced the problem. Once selected "OK" under the UAC prompt, I received a second cmd.exe that was spawned in "High" integrity.Flags: needinfo?(kamiljoz)

Thanks ash and Kamil.
So Kamil, for testing I think we just need an updated list per platform for any dll that is loaded. If it crashes on startup even, then that counts as something we need to protect against.
Using the new dll won't help with this compared to the old dll.
Please go through the list that you and others created at ahughes's wiki and make a new list for things we should protect against. This doesn't require you to go through every OS anymore. Just going through the main list.
We should check all OS only after we have a fix to this.
Before we weren't considering things that didn't launch a high integrity process.
But as ash found, the calls can be forwarded to the real dll so the process doesn't crash, and yet can still run attack code.

I'm going to split this into three different tickets to keep it cleaner and easier to follow rather than just pasting everything in here and making it difficult to follow. This ticket will concentrate on the unknown DLL's that are loaded during the Installer Update process with app.update.services being disabled. The progress will be recorded in the following wiki:
[https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Kjozwiak@mozilla.com/DLL\_Hijacking\_via\_Update](https://intranet.mozilla.org/User%3AKjozwiak%40mozilla.com/DLL_Hijacking_via_Update)

Quick Update:
- Installed all the needed Win OS's (both x64 and x86 versions)
- Went through each OS and listed all the unknown DLL's (went through this process twice to make sure nothing was missing)
- Once the entire unknown DLL list was created, went through each OS one more time to make sure nothing was missed
- Beginning to create the exploit DLL's using the utility/process mentioned in [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") (will be adding those steps in the wiki for future reference)

I finished going through each OS's unknown DLL's when using the "Update Route", I'll start on the Installer/Stub Installer tomorrow. Here are the remaining OS's:
\* Windows XP SP3 x86: [FOUND 0 DLL's]
\* Windows XP SP2 x64: [Found 5 POSSIBLE DLL's]
\* Windows 8.1 x86: [FOUND 2 DLL's]
\* Windows 8.1 x64: [FOUND 2 DLL's]
All the DLL's affected can be found in the following document:
- [https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Kjozwiak@mozilla.com/DLL\_Hijacking\_via\_Update](https://intranet.mozilla.org/User%3AKjozwiak%40mozilla.com/DLL_Hijacking_via_Update)
\*\* Note: Windows XP doesn't have integrity levels as it was added in Vista+. This makes it very difficult to know if the CMD that was spawned was in either high or medium integrity. I highlighted every DLL that spawned a CMD. These should be checked to ensure that they're not spawning in high integrity\*\*
I've added 7zip files of all the unknown DLL proxies and their originals for future use. These can be used to reproduce the issue. Each zip file includes x86 and x64 files.

Attached patch

[dlls.diff](attachment.cgi?id=8420726&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8420726&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=945192&attachment=8420726)

This is not for review, but I just wanted to flag you for feedback to see if you agree.
There's a total of 92 DLLs if you collapse each OS into a single directory.
Each OS has a different combination of DLLs which are exploitable.
Kamil spent a lot of time generating exploitable DLLs for each OS (Each OS needs it's own copy of the original DLL to forward the calls to so it is exploitable instead of crashing). Thank you Kamil, this wouldn't be possible without that work.
The patch attached here fixes the problem on Windows 8.1 (54 DLLs).
Creating this list of DLLs in the patch isn't as simple as just adding a string to the array.
You need to be very careful about DLL load order and figure out how they should be ordered with the help of both Dependency Walker and procmon.
For example, if you load a DLL from c:\windows\system32 directly, but that has a DLL dependency, it will load that dependency from the current directory and not c:\windows\system32. So you always have to make sure to load the dependency first from c:\windows\system32.
For me to determine the ordering, I'd need to update a version of the patch on each of (winxpx86, winxpx64, vistax86, vistax64, win7x86, win7x64, win8x86, win8x64, win8.1x86, win8.1x64)
There seems to be a at least a few DLL difference for each OS release. I'd expect this trend to continue for future OS releases.
Every time you make any change to the loaddlls.cpp list, you need to re-test each and every DLL again and verify it with procmon because of the dependency problem described. That means on the next Windows release we'd have a lot of work again.
---
So given all of that, I think the best course of action is to spend more time trying to find a one time fixes all solution. I'm going to work on a prototype app that gets this working, and then assuming I eventually succeed I'll port that up into updater.exe code. I'll update this ticket as I progress.

I've been thinking along the same lines. Perhaps removing or renaming dll's at the start and preloading only the dll's required to perform the removes or renames and if renamed renaming them back at the end. Perhaps there is a cleaner way?

Here's what I'm going to try going with:
This code would run just before executing the updater elevated (which is only when the maintenance service is not used).
1. Updater.exe (unelvated) creates a subdir inside updates\0\<randomname>
2. copies self to new dir
3. Set ACL on the new DIR to be similar to program files
4. Verify that the dir has no DLLs in it, if it does error out.
5. Executes exe elevated in the new dir instead of at same path.
<Update from elevated updater happens>
6. Removes permissions on current dir for all users (The elevated updater probably has to do this)
7. Updater.exe unelevated deletes the dir.
This relies on updater dir being on an NTFS volume, but I think that's just about everyone.
I don't think there's cause to worry about the XP case because it doesn't have integrity levels and so we aren't worried about someone using DLL injection to elevate a medium integrity malware to high.

Attached file
[WIP v1](attachment.cgi?id=8423567) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8423567&action=edit)

Looks like it's going to work. I attached a prototype that does the needed actions.
Note that we can also use this same process for the base installer exploits and the stub exploit. Maybe we'd put the code in a 7zip stub and then wrap the stub inside of it. (We'll discuss that later after this bug is done)
Here's the new flow:
1. Create new directory inside the updater dir
C:\Users\BrianR.Bondy\AppData\Local\Mozilla\updates\EEFEA8717BC47F65\updates\0\<newdir>
2. Copy updater.exe to <newdir>
3. Lock the <newdir> path so that properties can't be changed on the directory and it can't be deleted.
4. Set ACLs on <newdir> to deny all writes for the EVERYONE special group
5. Verify that the only file inside the dir is updater.exe
6. \*\*\*DO THE UPDATE\*\*\* (by executing <newdir>/updater.exe elevated.
7. Revert back the ACLs to the old ones.
8. unlock the path.
9. delete the <newdir> path.

Attached patch

[Securely update w/o the maintenance sevice - rev1.](attachment.cgi?id=8424397&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8424397&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=945192&attachment=8424397)

This should be a catch all solution to stop all DLL attacks on updater.exe when the service is not used. When the service is used, we already protect against that by copying the file to the maintenance service directory.
This works in a similar way by first copying updater.exe to a non-secure directory, then making it secure, then verifying that updater.exe is the only thing in that directory before executing it. If anything else got in, then it fails the update.
Just requesting feedback first because after arriving at an f+ I want to request sec approval, and then push to oak for testing. I'll probably ask Kamil to help test too on other OS because I don't have the disk space currently for VMs. Testing just requires making sure updates work on each of the supported OS when the service is disabled.
I did a local update and it worked, and was being elevated from the secure directory.

Securely update w/o the maintenance sevice - rev1.
Looks pretty damn good!
nit: SECURE\_ELEVATION\_UPDATE\_ERROR is a tad off. Perhaps SECURE\_LOCATION\_UPDATE\_ERROR or similar.
Do you think tests can be added for this?
Looking forward to the final patch and thanks!

this path is only hit when elevating, but I think maybe we can hack some kind of an env variable together to force doing that code without the elevation just to get it executing through tests. I think doing that is worth the extra effort.

Securely update w/o the maintenance sevice - rev1.
This request is for landing this and possibly follow up minor changes to the patch on oak to test. And if after testing that passes, and after r+, also for landing on mozilla-inbound.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
User needs to have physical unelevated access to the machine from a low integrity process at least via the same user account. Constructing a DLL isn't too hard if you are experienced at doing so. A typical developer doesn't know how to do that though.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The source code and comments do make it a bit obvious that we're protecting against dll injection attacks.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This issue has been present in some form forever. We realized recently that if you construct DLLs with the same export table as the matching DLL name, that the problem is generalized to a lot more DLLs that we didn't know about before. This bug is only present when updating without the NT service.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Patch should be the same for all branches if we uplift.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It's possible, but that's why I want to test thoroughly on oak. And ask for help from QA to help test other OS after initial testing.

Whatever got sec-approval + here did not actually land to central and now we are already at the end of FF30 beta (only an RC next Monday for last minute - very low risk landings).

This makes it so all non service, Windows update tests, run through the code path of elevation. This includes things like creating the secure directory and copying in the updater binary.
Instead of using the "runas" ShellExecute verb though, it just uses "open" to avoid the UAC prompt.

You've taken a pass at this from the f+ before, but I'd like to go for a review now that the automated tests are passing.
I wanted to call out that if any of the security steps to securing the updater.exe into its own directory fail, the whole update will not be applied.
Let me know if you think this could be a problem with FAT32 or something like that. I don't think that kind of setup will exist in a non trivial way on Vista+, but I'm not 100% positive.
We could consider only doing this for NTFS filesystems and if we confirm the path to the updater is a local file like we do here:

I verified that this works correctly with a devtools chrome enabled scratchpad. But I'm going to update it to 34 since this will likely land sometime in 33. 32.0a1 was only applicable if this was landing in 32.

Attached patch

[Patch for testing code path via env var - rev2](attachment.cgi?id=8439667&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8439667&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=945192&attachment=8439667)

Added an ifdef to stub out the disabling privs logging since it was causing comparison problems for the re-launched updater (both not launched and elevated was appending logs for staged updates). Was a test only problem.

I'm a tad concerned about the possibility of the directory being left behind without the permissions being reset but I \*think\* that is just my paranoia speaking.

Perhaps with a crash or something along those lines it would. Shouldn't cause a problem though because we use a new dir name each time. From my manual testing though it always cleans up.

Getting some test timesouts only on win7 for the try push both Release and Debug:
<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=61f2dc5043ce>
Win8 and winxp work.
I'll investigate more, but I setup a local VM of Win7 and Win8 and all tests passed on both :(

Still have that error, I think it would be ok to fix it by not using the env var that triggers this for that test, but I'd like to investigate more to be sure. I was pulled from my current activities to work on [bug 1009816](/show_bug.cgi?id=1009816 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox desktop: openh264 updates: check, download, install") though so will resume this once that's in review.

OK thanks, here's a bit of info:
Currently the failing test passes for me locally. But it fails on the talos machines.
It currently fails on the apply staged update phase.
The reason why I said in [Comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c58 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") that I think it can be skipped is because I think that we will never do elevation for staged updates.
It would be nice to figure out though. I put a few patches with some extra logging on Oak if you want to see those changesets too.

Brian, the changes I emailed you about seems to have fixed the errors you were seeing. The LocalFree(sd); in DenyWriteACLOnPath was still causing a couple of the tests to fail locally for me (commented out in the changeset I sent to try) and I'll investigate that further.

Hey Robert, I looked into this and the reason why is because the originalACL pointer actually points to a location within the buffer of sd. So freeing it early causes problems when it is used.
I'll upload a new patch with your fix and mine shortly and push to oak for testing.

Carrying forward r+.
- Includes rstrong's fix for not freeing
- Includes fix for returning / freeing sd at an appropriate time
This should not land until it is passes tests though. I'm pushing it to oak now. I didn't try locally because I updated the patch on OSX but if there's any issues I'll put a new patch up.

Looks like automated tests are passing now.
Kamil, would it be possible to test the Oak builds on the major Windows platforms?
XP SP2, Vista, Win7, Win8.1
The change is in this revision and later:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/oak/rev/9e099380262d>
The types of tests that would be needed are:
- Try upgrading from the 2nd newest Oak nightly (with the changeset above) to the newest Oak nightly (with that same changeset or later)
- Do this with service enabled
- Do this with service disabled
- Do this with service enabled and app.update.staging.enabled set to false
- Do this with service disabled and app.update.staging.enabled set to false
- Try running a single exploit that you know already happens with one of your DLLs on each platform. You don't need to run each of the exploits, just a single one.
- Anything else you can think of testing
If the testing goes well then this is ready to land after pushing to try one last time.QA Whiteboard: [qa+]Flags: needinfo?(kamiljoz)Keywords: [qawanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=qawanted&resolution=---)

Thanks for the heads up. If the manual testing is done by then and it all passes then maybe ya. If not, then it's safer to just wait one more version. It may be safer to wait anyway without uplifting early with a little bake time because of the chance of affecting updates.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I think we should probably wait anyway so don't kill yourself to get it done early. More bake time on Nightly is probably better for this type of bug.

Sounds good Brian, I'll start either way and make sure there isn't anything major that stands out. But I agree, having this bake a bit longer on Nightly is probably the best route.

That said, if we don't get this in 31, we'll have to backport it to ESR31 later since it is a sec-high bug.

Understood and backporting would be the better route since there is a decent chance for edge cases with this method of dealing with the possibility of files being copied into the directory we run the updater on a system.

This definitely not going to get in 31, so marking wontfix, will leave the ? on ESR24 in case we want to consider it for the next ESR24 (and once flags are available we'll want this for the ESR31 that ships with FF32 as well) - finally, updating the FF33 flags as it doesn't appear this has landed on trunk yet.

I haven't had the chance to go over this but I'll start it sometime next week. I'm currently in MTV for a work week and I'm really limited on time. Next week I'll be at a conference but I should have enough time to complete this by next week.

Brian, for Windows XP there's no way of telling the integrity level so I'm not sure if the CMD's spawned MEDIUM/HIGH etc.. I did go through all the updates and everything worked without any issues.
I got one crash when I was testing Win XP but I don't think it's related, would you mind taking a quick look just in case?? The crash happened when I closed fx and quickly tried re-opening it.. (this didn't happen during the actual update process):

Looks like the Oak patches passed testing Lawrence but it is advisable to have some bake time on mozilla-central with Nightly builds before uplifting. That probably means a natural train ride to aurora and then an uplift to the new beta 1.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

Thanks Brian. I agree about testing on m-c. Generally we give a couple of days on m-c unless a patch is thought to be riskier. If you think a couple of days will be enough in this case, we can still target beta9. However, if there is enough risk, I agree that we should wait a couple of weeks for beta1.

Yes there is significantly more risk than a typical patch.
Also I'm hesitant to land this \*right\* now because I won't have a lot of time available if there is fallout. I'd recommend waiting until after the next release, landing on m-c around beta-1, and then uplifting to aurora and beta after a couple weeks. I'm not currently under contract right now so I can't guarantee availability for fallout right now.
I can land if someone feels strongly about it, but I don't think there's a significant security risk in waiting. This issue is only exploitable if the user has locally installed malware or access and most people are updating with the service which doesn't have this issue.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I'm inclined to follow Brian's recommendation of landing after the merge (around 33 beta1 time frame) and considering for uplift around 33 beta 4/5. I will wait to hear from Dan or Al before confirming the plan.

Awaiting their response too, but I do think that's the best plan forward independent of my availability. I think it's too late to have it on release channel so there'd be no benefit to landing on m-c before the next uplift anyway.

I am concerned that this change caused a significant increase in the test failures that are recorded in [bug 1027039](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027039 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent marStageSuccessCompleteSvc.js | test failed (with xpcshell return code: 0), see following log:").

so it looks like the intermittent failure you mentioned used to happen even before this landed, but on the 10th and the 15th it had a few failures each. I'm not sure if that's because we only stared them on those days, or if there was something special that happened only on those days.
Anyway I'm going to look into it more but we shouldn't uplift until we figure out if the intermittent update failure is tests only or if it can affect real users too.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

Looks like telemetry is showing that there are quite a few error code 51s (SECURE\_LOCATION\_UPDATE\_ERROR) being returned as well. Since we haven't had any reports I assume this is an intermittent problem. But I think we should do a backout of this patch to be safe and re-land / test more on oak before re-uploading to m-c. We'll possibly see that the issue in [bug 1027039](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027039 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent marStageSuccessCompleteSvc.js | test failed (with xpcshell return code: 0), see following log:") goes down as well during that time and that would confirm for sure if that's related to this.

I basically finished testing most of the OS's in m-c and never ran into an issue while going through the updating process. I tried on all the OS's via VM's and on several other physical machines without any problems. I completed about 35 updates per OS/architecture, about 350 updates in total.
I'll talk to Brian and see if there's anything we can do to try to reproduce this on oak once the backout from m-c is completed.Flags: needinfo?(kamiljoz)

Backed out here:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/238c2d44c904>
It looks like this fix is causing an intermittent problem in tests and a different intermittent problem outside of tests. This is a very risky type of change by nature, and we made every precaution possible before landing, but there must still be some edge cases left to resolve.
The in tests one shouldn't be too hard to track down. The other one I'm not sure off hand how we can reproduce. But it's safest to not have this on m-c and definitely we shouldn't let it ride an uplift to aurora and beyond.
We made the right calls earlier in not landing this close to an uplift. What makes it risky is that normally a change like this can be coded with a fallback in mind, where if it fails you fall back to the old functionality, but since this is to stop a security attack you can't do that.
Kamil thanks for doing so many tests on all the OS' so far, I'll re-ping you once this lands on m-c again.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENED

Ya seen that just now. It's possible though that it's somehow related in some strange way because of the service. But I don't think so. The telemetry data showing the error is hit though is enough to warrant the backout alone. Let's see with happens with the test failure in the next couple days.

By the way I started to look into the intermittent test failure problem earlier today ([bug 1027039](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027039 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent marStageSuccessCompleteSvc.js | test failed (with xpcshell return code: 0), see following log:")). The error it's throwing is only called from the maintenance service. We don't compare updates without the maintenance service.
This patch only changes (or should only change) the flow for non maintenance service updates.
But the patch from this bug does change the updater binary code, and maintenance service uses the updater, so who knows.

Perhaps the maintenance service changes I am making that have been pushed to try stuck around on the build systems and caused the failures. :(

It could be, but shouldn't. But if there's an independent bug causing maintenance service to not be updated when running tests then either bug could have caused the esr test failures.
What should be happening is that the bootstrap service test should use whatever old service is currently installed (It gets reset on each reboot which I think is each test run) to replace the maintenance service to the one that's being tested. Then the rest of the updater service tests use that new service.
Check if your try pushes were around the times of the failures. What's really strange to me if it's this bug is that there were no starred failures before the 10th, this landed on the 5th. Also if there was some kind of problem comparing the updater binaries in [bug 1027039](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027039 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent marStageSuccessCompleteSvc.js | test failed (with xpcshell return code: 0), see following log:") because of us locking something from this bug, well that locking code shouldn't execute on service updates where the verify compare code is run.

If it isn't due to my try pushes or possibly the pushes to oak carrying over to other runs then I suspect either an infrastructure change or possibly a change that has been uplifted everywhere. Looking at today's beta push log nothing stood out though.

So, I was able to reproduce the test failure using the new service and the old tests so I think it is from my try pushes. Once again both a :) and :(

Indeed. I almost got there on my own, wanting to blame it on "a failure on trunk carries over to later runs on other branches," but I kept finding that the slaves failing on release branches hadn't had a starred failure on trunk, only unstarred failures on try. Or in some cases, unstarred greens, on your try pushes.
Don't suppose you know exactly what broken files in what locations on each version of Windows need to be removed to unbreak a slave? Inconveniently, what releng would usually do, just reimage the affected slaves, isn't possible at the moment because reimaging returns a slave that doesn't actually do anything at all right now, at least on Win8 and probably Win7.

Talked to Brian quickly and he suggested trying it on Win XP. I didn't get to Win XP when I was testing it in m-c but I did go through it in oak and never ran into an issue updating ([comment #83](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c83 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)")). Here's the cases that I quickly went through via m-c:
For the below, I went through both Win XP x64 and x86 (VM's):
Builds updating from:
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-09-01-09-10-08-mozilla-central/> (before fix)
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-09-06-03-02-04-mozilla-central/> (after fix)
- updated fx 5 different times with app.update.service.enabled;true without issues
- updated fx 5 different times with app.update.service.enabled;false without issues
I'll wait for more information from Brian's investigation into the issue and help wherever I can.

Attached patch

[new patch to land to gather more data. v1.](attachment.cgi?id=8495662&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8495662&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=945192&attachment=8495662)

So this still does all the same security steps as before.
But if any one step fails, it'll write a status failure with a code matching the exact failure. And it'll allow the update to proceed.
Upon loading post update processing, it'll log an extra telemetry entry for the status code, and it will reset itself to successful.
After review, I'll run this through try and on oak before pushing to m-c.
The plan would be to keep this on m-c for a few days and then back it out.
Then hopefully we'll know more about why we have failures to make a new patch.
If we get to a newer fix, then it'll likely not make it on this train, but would be the next one.

Since this won't likely make it this cycle and it will be introducing changes to updates on Windows at the same time that we are making changes to updates on Windows due to mac v2 signing please hold off on landing this again until a couple of days after mac v2 signing has landed.

I think default has some set expiration from when it was introduced? Never sounds correct to me because we don't want it going away.
> Just to verify, the plan is for these extra error codes to away?
Correct.
> Is this just to clean up the log output?
This isn't new in this new patch, but I believe it was causing a test failure when comparing log output without it ifdef'ed out. Because the test goes through the uac route so it calls it twice and the log gets appended.
> remove extra line
Will do.

Looks like that was introduced here:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1045108](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045108 "RESOLVED FIXED - Forcibly set the expiration version for outstanding probes")
To differentiate probes that have never had a default set from those that should actually never expire.
We definitely do want to never expire though for the status code.

Waiting to land on Oak for further testing until the Mac signing stuff is out of the way. This is to avoid the chance of slowing down Mac signing work due to potential problems with this.

Kamil could you try a few updates from Oak.
Things look good to me for pushing to m-c.
In particular you don't need to test anything with bad dlls, just updates w/ and w/o the service on xp, vista, and win7 (or instead of win7 win8):
This is the build: <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-10-03-13-46-22-oak/firefox-35.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe>
It should update to the latest on Oak.
If you run into any problems at all, please take a zip of the updater logs.
Also after the browser starts back up, check about:telemetry for UPDATER\_ALL\_STATUS\_CODES and screenshot it. I'll attached an example screenshot above.
If everything works for you and you don't run into any errors yourself I'll push to m-c.Flags: needinfo?(kamiljoz)

Attached patch

[patch rev1 - alt approach](attachment.cgi?id=8543599&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8543599&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=945192&attachment=8543599)

I tested both 32 and 64 bit on WinXP, WinVista, and Win7 using the dll's Kamil provided. The only issue is that both 32 and 64 bit WinVista crashed with apphelp.dll and had the 1 medium integrity cmd prompt. I suspect this is a bug in Vista and though it might possible to mitigate I am not too concerned with it... please let me know if you are. No other cmd prompts were created.
I verified that on Win 8.1 that SetDefaultDllDirectories does the right thing and doesn't load any of the dll's.
I haven't tested WinVista or Win7 with KB2533623 to make sure it does the right thing.
I'm going to add entries for 64 bit Firefox on Win7 in a followup patch if this approach makes sense hence why the f? vs. r?

SetDefaultDllDirectories was not used originally because I thought/think (and MSDN says) that it only effects LoadLibrary based DLL loading and not implicitly loaded dependencies:
<http://www.dependencywalker.com/help/html/dependency_types.htm>
I'm pretty sure we tried using it before, but that could have been pre- construction of these new types of DLLs.

Yes... with staging and the service disabled. I also verified that without this patch the cmd prompts are displayed. I'll let Kamil verify but it does appear to me to be the case. I also tested updating with all dll's in place and when using the preload none of the other dll's launched a cmd prompt when using the LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH flag whereas they did when that wasn't used. The same was true when using SetDefaultDllDirectories.
MSDN says, "The DLL search path is the set of directories that are searched for a DLL when a full path is not specified in a LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function call, or when a full path to the DLL is specified but the system must search for dependent DLLs.
The standard DLL search path contains directories that can be vulnerable to a DLL pre-loading attack. An application can use the SetDefaultDllDirectories function to specify a default DLL search path for the process that eliminates the most vulnerable directories and limits the other directories that are searched. The process DLL search path applies only to the calling process and persists for the life of the process."
My interpretation of this is that when specifying LOAD\_LIBRARY\_SEARCH\_SYSTEM32 then it will look in the system32 directory for the dll when a path is not specified. I tested this on Win8.1 and it didn't launch a cmd prompt and without it it did launch a cmd prompt.
Note that this patch no cmd prompts are launched for any of the dll's except for the one case on WinVista I mentioned.Flags: needinfo?(robert.strong.bugs)

OK I'd much prefer this approach as long as it works. I think the next step is to get some installers built for testing by Kamil to see if that works. And if so I'm fine with r+'ing this approach. Also since SetDefaultDllDirectories is win8+ only we'd need to test win7 and winvista separately.
Regarding the medium integrity process that is started, that's not concerning to me. Only high integrity is concerning. Although the crash could mean that there is some way not to crash that could lead to a high integrity possibly. Not likely, but perhaps possible.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I took a try build and repackaged it after changing the update channel to xpcshell-test and making the precomplete a noop so it can be tested using the signed simple.mar. This requires a couple of more steps to test but it should suffice.

Place the dlls to check alongside the mar file in the updates\0 sub directory of the update directory found in the previous step.
Restart to update to test.

I verified that SetDefaultDllDirectories is called on WinVista x86 with KB2533623 installed and that updates work without launching a cmd prompt with all dll's except apphelp.dll.
I also verified that the apphelp.dll is causing the WinVista crash before AutoLoadSystemDependencies is even called so the mitigations won't prevent the crash.

This is not expected to help the problem on Vista and Windows 7 right? If so, we should keep this bug hidden when it is fixed and post another new bug to handle the Windows 7 and vista cases. Also if so we can get Kamil to only test on Win8 to save time.

I believe it fixes the problem on all versions.
When SetDefaultDllDirectories is available (WinVista and Win7 with KB2533623 and Win8 and above) everything is fixed.
When SetDefaultDllDirectories is not available (WinVista and Win7 without KB2533623 and WinXP) it preloads dll's using LoadLibraryExW with the LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH flag. From msdn:
"If this value is used and lpFileName specifies an absolute path, the system uses the alternate file search strategy discussed in the Remarks section to find associated executable modules that the specified module causes to be loaded."
"If lpFileName specifies an absolute path and dwFlags is set to LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH, LoadLibraryEx uses the altered search path. The behavior is undefined when LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH flag is set, and lpFileName specifiies a relative path."
In my testing, other dll's loaded by the dll loaded using LoadLibraryEx with the LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH flag also use the altered search path.
Are there other cases that you know of?

Note: the "altered search path" is defined at
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#alternate\_search\_order\_for\_desktop\_applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx#alternate_search_order_for_desktop_applications)
"Alternate Search Order for Desktop Applications
The standard search order used by the system can be changed by calling the LoadLibraryEx function with LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH. The standard search order can also be changed by calling the SetDllDirectory function.
Windows XP: Changing the standard search order by calling SetDllDirectory is not supported until Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1).
If you specify an alternate search strategy, its behavior continues until all associated executable modules have been located. After the system starts processing DLL initialization routines, the system reverts to the standard search strategy.
The LoadLibraryEx function supports an alternate search order if the call specifies LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH and the lpFileName parameter specifies an absolute path.
Note that the standard search strategy and the alternate search strategy specified by LoadLibraryEx with LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH differ in just one way: The standard search begins in the calling application's directory, and the alternate search begins in the directory of the executable module that LoadLibraryEx is loading.
If SafeDllSearchMode is enabled, the alternate search order is as follows:
The directory specified by lpFileName.
The system directory. Use the GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched.
The Windows directory. Use the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path of this directory.
The current directory.
The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. Note that this does not include the per-application path specified by the App Paths registry key. The App Paths key is not used when computing the DLL search path."
So, it uses the dll's directory since it is loaded using a full path and the LOAD\_WITH\_ALTERED\_SEARCH\_PATH flag is specified.

Yup, the DLL's that I used/attached are proxy DLL's that are based on the exports of the original unknown DLL's that I found using WinObj and Process Monitor. For each OS, I added the original unknown DLL and the proxy DLL, example:
\* apphelp.dll -> proxy DLL
\* apphelp\_orig.dll -> original DLL
\* crypt32.dll -> proxy DLL
\* crypt32\_orig.dll -> original DLL
Place both the proxy and the original DLL into the "updates/0" folder to reproduce the issue.

Just noticed on Vista when using SetDefaultDllDirectories that secur32.dll causes the update to fail though these is no cmd prompt. I might just not use SetDefaultDllDirectories on Vista since preloading works with secur32.dll. Need to check Win7 as well for similar issues.

Since I have this code on the brain I went ahead and tested WinXP and Win7 and they both suffer from the same problem as WinVista. For some reason wsock32.dll is still using rsaenh.dll from the app dir though it isn't launching a cmd prompt... I'm investigating.
Kamil, if you do check anything just check Win8 and Win8.1 until I track this down.

The issue with rasenh.dll is in part due to when crypto is used it reads the registry to find the dll to load and for some reason doesn't respect the altered path. On Vista (I assume xp as well) the ImagePath value is rsaenh.dll and on Win8 it is %SystemRoot%\system32\rsaenh.dll.
All other dll's do the right thing with the patch except for apphelp.dll on Vista which appears to load before we can do anything. Also, it crashes and elevation doesn't occur.
Brian, any suggestions on how to deal with this? I am sorely tempted to change the registry key to a full path before cert checking and backing out the change when it completes.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I'm surprised that with loading via only "rsaenh.dll" that it doesn't use the already loaded module from loaddlls.cpp. Did you try changing to an absolute path in the registry to verify that it does indeed fix the problem?Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I have changed it and it worked without a problem... changed it back and it failed again. I suspect that it is doing its own loadlibrary call after reading the registry and that is using the default search path which would look in the app dir first since it doesn't have an absolute path.

I think it was always possible but just not desired by others. Don't remember who for sure, but maybe it was bsmith who didn't want to make app updates dependent on nss in case nss breaks. There could be other reasons too which I don't know of, but as I recall that was the reasoning. It would probably be not a lot of config changes to do it since we already have it working for Linux. Another option is just doing sha2 on the platforms that support it for minimal risk/changes, and since eventually all platforms will support it. But that gets into a lot of other discussions so I'll cut it off there :)Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

I was using bcrypt.dll on Win 8.1 x64 and cryptsp.dll on Win 8 x64. I just picked them randomly from the 7zip archive I attached earlier to quickly test and make sure I was doing it correctly before running through all the other DLL's.

\*\* placed bcrypt.dll and bcrypt\_orig.dll into "\updates\0" once update.mar, update.status, update.version was pulled

After testing on all Windows versions though not all SPs it appears that the rsaenh.dll issue only affects WinXP and WinVista. I also checked the registry on the systems and only WinXP and WinVista don't specify the path to rsaenh.dll. Since other versions of Windows specify the full path and this only affecting older versions of Windows I'm much more ok with changing the registry when possible.

Kamil, not a problem whatsoever and I'm glad everything worked out!
You can test Win7 and above with 32 bit Firefox. After I get a hack in for the registry entry WinXP and WinVista should be good to test.
Would you be able to get the list of DLL's on Win7 with Firefox 64 bit as you did for Firefox 32 bit? Only Win7 is needed since we only support Firefox on Win7 and above and the call to SetDefaultDllDirectories fixes this bug on Win8 and above. Thanks!

I'll try getting it done sometime this week but it will be pretty hard as I'm doing fx35 and ESR verifications (release week). I can get it done Monday/Tuesday of next week. Let me know if you need it sooner.

New installer for testing Firefox 32 bit using the latest patch
<http://exchangecode.com/robert/work/bug945192-installer-v2.exe>
I've included the change to app.update.url.override in this installer so it doesn't need to be added during testing.
I've tested this on WinXP SP2, Vista x86 and x64 with and without KB2533623, Windows 8 x86, and Windows 8.1 x64 and it addresses everything for Firefox x86 except the crash due to apphelp.dll on Vista x86 and x64 which crashes before elevation, a non-elevated cmd prompt is launched, and no elevated cmd prompt is launched.
I think the patch as it stands covers everything for Firefox x86. The only thing left is getting the DLL's for Firefox x64 on Win7.
Kamil, I wouldn't bother testing until after Firefox x64 is addressed.Status: REOPENED → ASSIGNED

I'll start that sometime this weekend and should be done by Monday. Robert, should I go through all the DLL's in Vista/XP like I did in [comment # 214](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c214 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") for the x86 patch?

Assuming we're confident in the patch enough to land all branches (beta + ESR in particular) how much testing do you need? We're at the beginning of a cycle--can you get enough testing if you land now and uplift to branches in the next week or so?
It's fairly obvious what's going on from the patch, but it's a local exploit rather than remote so that takes a lot of the heat off. And no one wants to break the updater! So it'd be ideal to get it into the same release as the cycle you land in (that is, if you land now get it into Firefox 36) but apart from that land as early as you need to get sufficient testing.
Above is provisional, please request sec-approval? on the patch and answer the questions just in case some detail changes the picture. But "soon" is probably fine.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8550340&action=edit)

Robert, so I went through the entire process on Win 7 x64 using fx x64 and generated all the proxy DLL's using the same method as before. However, I couldn't reproduce the original issue using the DLL's I've listed below.. The CMD prompts never appeared. I tried several times, created the proxy DLL's a few times to make sure I was doing it correctly but still couldn't get any CMD prompts to appear.
I think the program that I'm using is always creating x86 proxy DLL's rather than x64 DLL's hence not being able to reproduce the problem on x64. Either that or fx x64 is doing something differently than fx x86?
I've attached the source of the program that I'm using, could you take a look and see if that's the case? If it is, would you be able to modify it so it spits out x64 DLL's?? (if that's even the issue)

I went through the dll's loaded and limited the preloads to just the dlls loaded from the update directory which I believe will solve this. I'll verify over the weekend.

[bcrypt high integrity cmd.exe on Win 7 x64](attachment.cgi?id=8550983) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8550983&action=edit)

Robert, I pulled an all nighter and found out that the original creator of wrappit (the cmd tool used to create the x86 DLL's) also created wrappit2 that supports x64 DLL's. Unfortunately there was barely any documentation so I spent the night hacking away at it and finally figured it out :) Learned a lot about the entire linking/compiling process! I double checked and made sure that the proxy is x64 and reproduced the cmd.exe in high integrity on my VM Win 7 x64.
Could you check it out on your end and see if you can also reproduce the high integrity cmd.exe? If it works for you, I'll start creating all the other proxy x64 DLLs (shouldn't take that long as I have the process down)
Used the following STR:
- Win 7 Pro SP1 x64
- Build: <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2015-01-13-03-02-05-mozilla-central/>
- Once installed --> app.update.service.enabled;false (restarted the browser)
- add bcrypt.dll and bcryptold.dll into "updates\0"

So, I went with preloading the dll's that are loaded from the updates/0 directory based on procmon to create the following Firefox x86 and x64 builds
[http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/rstrong@mozilla.com-8b431b099e47/](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/rstrong%40mozilla.com-8b431b099e47/)
Everything looks good on Firefox x64 on Win 7 x64 through Win8.1 x64 and on WinXP through Win8.1 both x86 and x64 with the following exceptions.
Firefox x86 - apphelp.dll is loaded on Win Vista x86 and x64 before the preloading code.
Firefox x86 - wow64log.dll is loaded on Win XP x64 before the preloading code.
I'm going to try to come up with a way to prevent these 2 dll's from loading over the next couple of days.

Went through each of the following DLL's and ensured that they're all x64 DLL's. I also went through each DLL twice using my Win 7 Pro SP1 x64 VM and ensured I got the same results:

Everything passes except for the previous mentioned exceptions using the Firefox x86 build on WinXP, WinVista, Win7, Win8, and Win8.1 on Windows x86 and x64.
Everything passes using the Firefox x64 build on Win7, Win8, and Win8.1 on Windows x64.
So close...
Note: I used process monitor to find the attempts to load dlls in the same directory as the updater.exe and preloaded only those. After creating the build with only those pre-loaded I verified that no additional dll load attempts were made in that directory.

The patch as it stands I believe covers loading all dll's placed in the directory alongside the updater.exe except for the following cases using Firefox x86:
Windows Vista x86 and x64 - apphelp.dll
Windows XP x64 - wow64log.dll
Firefox x64 is fixed.
To fix this for the two cases above the directory where the updater.exe would need to be secured which we can't guarantee with our current policy of allowing users to install into a directory of their own choosing and the fact that the user can change the permissions of the directory.
To address these two cases I am planning on running the updater from the application directory when not using the service. This would require not staging updates when not using the service which I don't see as a major issue since the vast majority of users use the maintenance service with less than 5% not using it according to telemetry. The visible affect of not using staging is it taking longer to apply an update during startup.
Making app update use the updater.exe from the application directory will take time to implement and I am unsure of the amount of time it will take. Since the affected systems after the current patch lands are a very small subset of the Windows install base we need to decide whether or not we should hold off on landing the current patch until this additional work is completed.

Although the documentation states that an embedded manifest disables .Local redirection my testing shows that it doesn't disable it entirely when using a <exe\_full\_name>.Local directory in that it attempts to load the comctl32.dll SxS from within a sub-directory of the <exe\_full\_name>.Local directory and it does so before the preloading code. A couple of examples:
Win Vista
updates\0\updater.exe.Local\x86\_microsoft.windows.common-controls\_6595b64144ccf1df\_6.0.6002.18005\_none\_5cb72f96088b0de0
Win 7
updates\0\updater.exe.Local\x86\_microsoft.windows.common-controls\_6595b64144ccf1df\_6.0.7601.17514\_none\_41e6975e2bd6f2b2
There are no other attempts to load DLLs from this location.
Redirection does not occur with an updater.exe.Local file.

On Win 7 x86 commctl32.dll opened one cmd prompt without elevation.
On Win Vista x86 commctl32.dll opened two cmd prompts... 1 without elevation and 1 with elevation.
Locations of the dlls had to be as follows
Win 7

The original dll had to be prefixed with a '.' and located in the following directory
updates\0\.comctl32\_orig.dll
Win Vista
updates\0\updater.exe.Local\x86\_microsoft.windows.common-controls\_6595b64144ccf1df\_6.0.6002.18005\_none\_5cb72f96088b0de0\comctl32.dll

I think it would be good to land without the additional work but just keep this bug private if that's possible. That's probably a call for someone on the sec team (I see you have dveditz flagged already for more info for that).
I agree with running the update from the application directory and not using bgupdates. We should minimize this to only on the OS' where it is needed and keep existing flows without the service the same. If that doesn't work for some reason we could always fall back to the original patch for this, but it was failing when landed for some machines for an unknown reason via telemetry stats so I'd rather avoid that original approach that I did if possible.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

Not surprised to see that Win XP also has the updater.exe.Local SxS bug
updater.exe.Local\WOW64\_Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls\_6595b64144ccf1df\_6.0.3790.3959\_x-ww\_5FA17F4E\comctl32.dll
I verified again that Win7 doesn't load the updater.exe.Local\\*\comctl32.dll in the elevated process.
I'll check whether Win8 and Win8.1 also don't load the updater.exe.Local\\*\comctl32.dll in the elevated process and I think that will be it for this approach and I'll work on implementing [comment #250](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c250 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") hopefully soon after.

This should be the last preloading patch. If comctl32.dll is not delay loaded that it does load in the elevated process on Win 7 and that if updater.exe crashes it will try to load dwmapi.dll from the app dir.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
As long as there is local file system access fairly easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I did add one comment of "+ Note: dwmapi.dll is preloaded since a crash will try to load it from the application's directory." but I think the code as is makes it fairly obvious.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I think it will apply cleanly but if not it is trivial to create backports.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely to create regressions. I'd like this to be on Nightly for a few days before uplifting just in case though I have very few concerns about it regressing.
Note: since this is not a complete fix I'd like to not open this bug to the public until after I have changed the update process to run out of the application directory when not using the service.

I didn't realize this was going to be uplifted before it had been on Nightly a couple of days as I stated. I think it will be ok \*crosses fingers\*
Kamil, I went ahead and used procmon to see all attempts to load dll's from the update directory instead of going with unknown dll's. I suggest going with your existing method where you use proxy dll's as well as using procmon to find any dll load attempts. When doing that you should create a directory named updater.exe.Local alongside the updater.exe to find the SxS dll directory it tries to load on Win 7 and below. Then run it again with procmon and the updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>. In my tests it will try to load comctl32.dll from this directory. See [comment #257](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c257 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") for more information.
I think in the end you'll end up with
Win XP - x86 and x64
Firefox x86 - wow64log.dll and the updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>\comctl32.dll both medium and elevated
Win Vista - x86 and x64
Firefox x86 - apphelp.dll and the updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>\comctl32.dll both medium and elevated
Win 7 - x86 and x64
Firefox x86 - updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>\comctl32.dll only medium
Win 7 - x64
Firefox x64 - updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>\comctl32.dll only medium
Win 8 and Win 8.1 - x86 and x64
Firefox x86 - none
Win 8 and Win 8.1 - x64
Firefox x64 - none
Please also verify that an updater.exe.Local file doesn't try to load sxs dll's from the directory or any other dll's besides wow64log.dll on WinXP and apphelp.dll on Win Vista.
It would be good to check the affect of KB2533623 on Win Vista and Win 7 as well.Flags: needinfo?(kjozwiak)

Yeah but then we can lose track of approval requests... I figure that if no one adds the checkin-needed keyword, things don't just get checked in magically without prompting or work from the dev.

Kamil, after testing nightly with a real update I suspect that the updater.exe.Local\<sxs directory name>\comctl32.dll may still be exploitable on all Windows versions. :(

Brian, for the case where there is an updater.exe.Local directory alongside the updater.exe what do you think about not displaying the ui and thereby avoid loading the SxS comctl32.dll? It is simple enough and would cover all cases for Win7 and above completely.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

We may have to load whatever APIs that use SxS comctl32.dll dynamically or else it might lead to SxS comctl32.dll loading even if the UI is not shown. But I think that approach is genius and definitely worth trying out.Flags: needinfo?(netzen)

:rstrong, :abillings,
This broke MSVC2010 (on win2k3) for SeaMonkey builds, I'm loathe to backout a sec fix to produce our builds, but I don't see a way around it at a glance, this Function is not available in the SDK we have at present.
Note MSVC2010 is still supported on beta/esr31 at present, even though Firefox's official builds use MSVC 2013.

Justin, could you open a new bug for that? To be sure that the sheriff see the uplift request, I would have to change the "status-firefoxXY" flags to affected.
Moreover, it is a different issue by itself.

I'm of the mindset of keeping landings/bugs with the patches that got reviewed.
I don't mind owning the landings if they get approval, especially if before the beta->release uplift.Flags: needinfo?(bugspam.Callek)

Note: since this is not a complete fix I'd like to not open this bug to the public until after I have changed the update process to run out of the application directory when not using the service.
That will happen in [bug 1127481](/show_bug.cgi?id=1127481 "VERIFIED FIXED - Run updater.exe from the application directory when not using the service for an update")

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #945192](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") +++
From [bug 945192 comment #250](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192#c250 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)")
"The patch as it stands I believe covers loading all dll's placed in the directory alongside the updater.exe except for the following cases using Firefox x86:
Windows Vista x86 and x64 - apphelp.dll
Windows XP x64 - wow64log.dll
Firefox x64 is fixed.
To fix this for the two cases above the directory where the updater.exe would need to be secured which we can't guarantee with our current policy of allowing users to install into a directory of their own choosing and the fact that the user can change the permissions of the directory.
To address these two cases I am planning on running the updater from the application directory when not using the service. This would require not staging updates when not using the service which I don't see as a major issue since the vast majority of users use the maintenance service with less than 5% not using it according to telemetry. The visible affect of not using staging is it taking longer to apply an update during startup.
Making app update use the updater.exe from the application directory will take time to implement and I am unsure of the amount of time it will take. Since the affected systems after the current patch lands are a very small subset of the Windows install base we need to decide whether or not we should hold off on landing the current patch until this additional work is completed."

I'd like to get feedback on this approach. Note: the nsUpdateDriver.cpp code will be refactored in [bug 1156046](/show_bug.cgi?id=1156046 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsUpdateProcessor::ProcessUpdate should use the directory service instead of nsXREDirProvider (also removes app update gonk support)") and I'd like to keep the changes to it simple in this bug so it can be easily uplifted.

I've tested the different paths this can take and all is looking good. I'll clean up the patch and submit it for review soon.

Though with a little work it should be possible to merge remove\_recursive\_on\_reboot with ensure\_remove\_recursive I don't want to do that in this bug since it would add risk to the patch and this patch will likely get uplifted.

nit: I wonder if these steps should be kept outside of the #ifndef, since running the updater with the correct arguments still applies to Windows. This is even more the case for the steps in |ApplyUpdates| later in this file. Maybe the step about copying the updater could be changed to say "on all platforms but Windows", or something like that?

I considered that and instead rely on the logging that follows this since that is all that is needed.

Attached patch

[patch for landing](attachment.cgi?id=8598828&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8598828&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1127481&attachment=8598828)

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not too easily and less easily than other patches I've landed to mitigate this bug.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Not yet but it should be fairly simple to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Manual testing leads me to believe that this won't cause regressions but I still want this on nightly for around a week before uplifting.

To verify this bug you should be able to just use procmon and verify that the updater.exe process doesn't try to load any dll's from the updates directory.

Process Name updater.exe and the path to your Windows profile should be sufficient for a filter. Then just search for .dll

Currently can't verify the following channels:
\* fx38 - the two latest builds are from 29-Apr-2015 and 04-May-2015. Because the fix was merged on 01-May-2015 ([comment # 33](/show_bug.cgi?id=1127481#c33 "VERIFIED FIXED - Run updater.exe from the application directory when not using the service for an update")), I need two builds that have been created after 2015-05-01 to correctly update. Right now, there's only the build from 04-May-2015.
\* fx38.0.5 - not created yet (will need two builds to test updating)
\* fx-esr38 - only a single nightly build is currently available from 05-May-2015. As mentioned above, I need two builds.
I can't use debug builds (2015-05-05-mozilla-esr38-debug) nor tinderbox builds because they're not nighties and don't have updates enabled. I'll have to wait until I either have two nightly builds that have been created after the fix was merged.
Robert, let me know if there's anything else I can do. I'll leave the needinfo for Florin ([comment # 39](/show_bug.cgi?id=1127481#c39 "VERIFIED FIXED - Run updater.exe from the application directory when not using the service for an update")) in case he knows any other builds that have been created that I can use but can't find.Flags: needinfo?(robert.strong.bugs)

You can use the following to force the latest esr38 to update to itself
<http://exchangecode.com/robert/work/snippets/esr38.xml>
You can also use the following url to apply an empty update to test this.
<http://exchangecode.com/robert/work/snippets/general.xml>
Just add a new string pref named app.update.url.override with the value of the url you are using
