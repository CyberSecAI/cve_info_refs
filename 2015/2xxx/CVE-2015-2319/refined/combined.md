| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1202869#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-17 15:19:28 UTC  ``` Three flaws were discovered in Mono's TLS implementation:  A TLS impersonation attack was discovered in Mono's TLS stack by researchers at Inria. During checks on our TLS stack, we have discovered two further issues which we have fixed - SSLv2 support, and vulnerability to FREAK. These vulnerabilities affect basically every Mono version ever released.  This is fixed in Mono version 3.12.1:  <http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-3.12.1.tar.bz2>  Upstream patches:  <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/9c38772f094168d8bfd5bc73bf8925cd04faad10> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b>  Additional Information:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/772>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1202869#c1)  Claudio Rodrigo Pereyra DIaz    2015-03-17 18:09:54 UTC  ``` I have a copr repo with 3.12.1 for F20 and F21 {i686,x86_64} F22 a and rawhide I have some problem compiling the same package.  Copr <https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/elsupergomez/mono/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1202869#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-18 16:06:31 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned CVEs for these flaws in <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/869>:  Use [CVE-2015-2318](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-2318) for the <https://www.smacktls.com> SKIP-TLS issue in Mono.  Use [CVE-2015-2319](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-2319) for the <https://www.smacktls.com> FREAK issue in Mono.

# SMACK: State Machine AttaCKs

![](/i/smacktls.png)
Implementations of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol must handle a
variety of protocol versions and extensions, authentication
modes and key exchange methods, where each combination may prescribe
a different message sequence between the client and the server.
We address the problem of designing a robust *composite*
state machine that can correctly multiplex between these
different protocol modes.

We systematically tested popular open-source TLS implementations for
state machine bugs and discover several new critical security vulnerabilities
that have lain hidden in these libraries for years.
We call these collection of vulnerabilities SMACK: State Machine Attacks on TLS.

This page presents exploits and disclosure information related to these
attacks. For a technical overview of the TLS state machine and our
protocol fuzzing methodology, please refer to our upcoming research paper
at IEEE Security & Privacy 2015 and the following materials:

## Threat Model

All the attacks on this page assume a *network adversary* (i.e. a
[man-in-the-middle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack))
to tamper with TLS handshake messages.
The typical scenario to mount such attacks is by tampering with the
Domain Name System (DNS), for example via [DNS rebinding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) or [domain name seizure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name#Seizures).

## SKIP-TLS: Message Skipping Attacks on TLS

![TLS state machine implemented in JSSE](/i/java.svg)

*Fig. 1: TLS State machine in JSSE*

Different cipher suites in TLS use different message sequences.
For instance, in ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (including ECDHE),
server authentication relies on the Server Key Exchange message,
whereas this message is completely skipped in the RSA key exchange.
As another example, in non-ephemeral (non [forward-secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)) variants of Diffie-Hellman cipher
suites, clients use the DH keys embedded in server certificates instead of
freshly generated keys provided in the Server Key Exchange.

We find that several TLS implementations incorrectly allow some messages
to be skipped even though they are required for the selected cipher suite.
The explanation for these attacks is very simple: libraries attempt to reuse
as much code as possible between the different cipher suites. However, the
consequences of these vulnerabilities can be severe.

For instance, Fig. 1 shows the TLS state machine implemented in JSSE
(the Java implementation of TLS shipped with the JDK). Black arrows represent
the state machine according to the protocol specification. Green arrows
represent incorrect transitions in the server state machine; red arrows
represent incorrect transitions in the client state machine.

This figure shows that *JSSE clients allow the peer to skip all
messages related to key exchange and authentication*. In particular,
a network attacker can send the certificate of any arbitrary website,
and skip the rest of the protocol messages. A vulnerable JSSE client
is then willing to accept the certificate and start exchanging
unencrypted application data. In other words, the JSSE implementation
of TLS has been providing virtually no security guarantee (no
authentication, no integrity, no confidentiality) for the past several
years.

Our attacks show that a malicious server can simply skip TLS altogether:
it can pretend to be any server and exchange plaintext data with the client.
Still Java clients are used routinely to access sensitive HTTPS APIs
such as [Google](https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client),
[Paypal](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Java-SDK), and
[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/)
through popular Java SDKs.

### SKIP-TLS: Disclosure Information

* **JSSE** (CVE-2014-6593): vulnerable to server impersonation. The [January 2015 critical update](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2015-1972971.html) for Java 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 prevents the attack.
* **CyaSSL**: vulnerable to client and server impersonation. [Version 3.3.0](http://www.yassl.com/yaSSL/Docs-cyassl-changelog.html) prevents the attack.
* **OpenSSL** (CVE-2015-0205): vulnerable to client impersonation if server accepts static Diffie-Hellman certificates. OpenSSL 1.0.1k prevents the attack.
* **Mono**: default TLS library vulnerable to client impersonation. Version 3.12.1 prevents the attack.
* **axTLS**: vulnerable to client impersonation. Version 1.5.2 prevents the attack.
* **Other disclosure pending**

### SKIP-TLS: Am I Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you use client software that uses one of the above TLS libraries
to connect to HTTPS (or IMAPS/SMTPS) servers over an insecure network (such as public Wi-Fi).
If your client uses, for example, the latest version of OpenSSL, you are probably not affected by this attack.

We provide an online server to test your client for the specific SKIP-TLS attack against JSSE.
Point your HTTPS client to https://ht.vc:6443 - in Java e.g. (new URL("https://ht.vc:6443")).openConnection().
If the connection doesn't trigger an exception, you are vulnerable (please note, you may
get an exception if our test server is down).

## FREAK: Factoring RSA Export Keys

![FREAK exploit on Safari](/i/safari.png)

*Fig. 2: FREAK exploit on Safari*

Among the various state machine problems we found, one is particularly interesting because
it leads to a server impersonation exploits against several mainstream browsers (including Safari
and OpenSSL-based browsers on Android).

This attack targets a class of deliberately weak **export cipher suites**.
As the name implies, this class of algorithms were
[introduced under the pressure of US
governments agencies to ensure that they would be able to decrypt all foreign encrypted
communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States), while stronger algorithms were banned from export (as
they were classified as weapons of war).

Support for these weak algorithms has remained in many implementations
such as OpenSSL, even though they are typically disabled by default;
however, we discovered that several implementations incorrectly allow
the message sequence of export ciphersuites to be used even if a non-export
ciphersuite was negotiated.

Thus, if a server is willing to negotiate an export ciphersuite, a man-in-the-middle
may trick a browser (which normally doesn't allow it) to use a weak export
key. By design, export RSA moduli must be less than 512 bits long; hence, they
can be factored in less than 12 hours for $100 on Amazon EC2.

Ironically, many US government agencies (including the NSA and FBI), as well as a
number of popular websites (IBM, or Symantec)
enable export ciphersuites on their server - by factoring ther 512-bit RSA modulus,
an attacker can impersonate them to vulnerable clients.

Your browser does not support MP4 videos.

Other than websites, HTTPS servers that enable export ciphersuites include those that host
popular third-party JavaScript, such as the [Facebook JavaScript SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript)
(loaded in most sites that use Facebook's Like or Login button).
By impersonating such vulnerable script servers, an attacker can
inject arbitrary JavaScript into any number of innocent third-party
websites to steal user data (such as passwords) entered on these sites.
We demo how an attacker can perform widespread XSS attacks after factoring
the 512-bit RSA modulus for connect.facebook.net (the site that serves Facebook's JavaScript SDK).

Other client applications (such as email) that use the above TLS libraries may also be affected.
Mobile apps that bundle their own TLS libraries are also vulnerable, as [shown here](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/03/freak_out_on_mobile.html).

### FREAK: Am I Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you use a buggy web browser (see above)
to connect, over an insecure network, to an HTTPS website that allows export ciphersuites.
If you use Chrome 41 or Firefox to connect to a site that only offers strong ciphers,
you are probably not affected.

Try to access <https://www.smacktls.com/freak>
from your browser. If it succeeds, you are vulnerable.

# TLS Vulnerabilities

Miguel de Icaza

March 7, 2015
 security

A TLS impersonation attack was discovered in Mono’s TLS stack by
researchers at Inria
([SKIP-TLS](https://www.smacktls.com/#skip). During checks on our TLS
stack, we have discovered two further issues which we have fixed -
SSLv2 support, and vulnerability to
[FREAK](https://www.smacktls.com/#freak). These vulnerabilities affect
basically every Mono version ever released.

All three issues should be addressed in the following patches:

* Patch to address [SKIP TLS vulnerability](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4)
* Patch to address [FREAK vulnerability](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/9c38772f094168d8bfd5bc73bf8925cd04faad10)
* [Removal of SSLv2](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b)

These patches should apply to all Mono versions from 3.4.0 or so
onwards. The FREAK patch requires slight modification
in order to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.x [patch for Mono
pre-3.4](https://gist.github.com/directhex/728af6f96d1b8c976659)
should work for these users. The Impersonation patch requires slight
modification to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.4 [patch for Mono
pre-3.4](https://gist.github.com/directhex/f8c6e67f551d8a608154)
should work for these users.

Alternatively, this is fixed in Mono 3.12.1 and higher:
[mono-3.12.1.tar.bz2](https://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-3.12.1.tar.bz2)

Mono’s github repository contains the bug fix for all supported branches
(master, mono-4.0.0-branch, mono-3.12.0-branch, mono-3.10.0-branch).

Linux and Mac downloads from
[mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com) have been updated to
3.12.1 - the Windows release will take another day or two.

# State Machine Attacks

---

Transport Layer Security (TLS) handles quite a bit of “heavy lifting” in the digital world.

Responsible for processing multiple protocol variations, number of different extensions and authentication modes, and “handshakes” between a variety of exchange methods – exchange methods with unique combinations of message sequence between servers and clients, no less – the fact that it works at all is a marvel of modern engineering.

To really stress test the capabilities of TLS, though, a number of individuals have been searching out and hunting for state machine bugs, all in an effort to uncover as many security vulnerabilities as possible. This goes far beyond the expertise of someone just learning [how to start a blog as a beginner](https://www.theblogstarter.com).

This kind of “white hat” hacking is a critical part of digital security these days.

Without it, vulnerabilities – some that have existed for years inside of TLS libraries – would have continued to be exploited by bad actors, usually without anyone being the wiser.

Let’s outline how these targeted attacks were conducted and what was uncovered along the way.

## Breaking Down the Threat Model

Better the gate, it’s important to understand that each and every single one of the attacks that we conducted on TLS were done specifically to interfere with, hijack, or somehow obfuscate the “handshake messages” in TLS itself.

Through a variety of different approaches we were able to “fuzzy things up a little bit”, especially when it came to tampering with the DNS (Domain Name Systems) information used throughout TLS in the first place.

Some of this involved refining the DNS information passed through the handshake agreement, but other attacks were little more overt – involving straight up domain name seizure in some cases.

## Messaging Attacks on TLS

One of the largest hurdles to clear with these kinds of attacks was figuring out how to handle the variety of cipher suites that are taken advantage of in each TLS message sequence.

For example, and some cipher suites (like ECDHE) a server cannot become authenticated until a server key exchange message has had a handshake with TLS.

At the same time, the RSA cipher suite requires absolutely no server key exchange message whatsoever – skipping it entirely – throughout the authentication process.

Interestingly enough, throughout the research we were able to uncover the fact that a lot of TLS implementations simply allowed for this authentication message to be skipped over and worked around – even if the protocol “required” this kind of authentication message to proceed.

Further research showed that a big piece of this security vulnerability was due to the fact that so many different TLS libraries out there use the same code base as so many others. One vulnerability in the “original code” significantly amplifies that same vulnerability across every other new piece of code that uses it as a baseline.

A number of the attacks pushed out during the research showed that TLS can be worked around completely in some circumstances. All a server has to do is pretend that it has already exchanged the data with the client and you are off to the races.

Interestingly enough, some of the most secure (supposedly) HTTPS API tools – including those used by PayPal, Amazon, and Google – continued use code with these vulnerabilities built right in.

## SKIP-TLS Risk Audit – Finding Your Level of Vulnerability

Our research shows that it is mission-critical to conduct a risk audit specifically targeted towards SKIP-TLS to root out these kinds of vulnerabilities.

The overwhelming majority of people that are going to suffer from these vulnerabilities are going to be taking advantage of clients using compromised code base as we highlighted above.

Any code base using TLS libraries to connect to HTTPS across insecure networks (like open Wi-Fi networks or public Wi-Fi networks, for example) are especially vulnerable.

We also discovered that any clients that are still taking advantage of OpenSSL (with sole exception of the most up-to-date version) are likely suffering from these same kinds of vulnerabilities, too.

A quick way to do a risk audit for these types of attacks all on your own is to simply point your own HTTPS client to the auditor through Java.

If this connection reports an exception you are likely safe and secure from these kinds of threats.

If not, you have vulnerabilities that need to be taking care of.

## FREAK: RSA Export Key Factoring

Another state machine issue that researchers were able to uncover has to do with servers impersonating some of the most popular web browsers on the market today and basically hijacking them through export cipher suites.

This particular type of attack (the Factoring RSA export keys attack) were made possible because of regulations implemented by the United States government – particularly on the national intelligence side of things – to create “backdoors” that would allow them to decrypt foreign communications that have been otherwise encrypted already.

The same regulations locked down more advanced encryption algorithms completely, not allowing them to be exported overseas. The government went so far as to classify these encryption algorithms as “weapons of war”!

Because of this approach, however, a variety of different platforms (including those run by the government) are purposefully using systems with known security vulnerabilities.

The week encryption algorithms are widespread throughout the OpenSSL environment, even though many of them have been toggled “disabled” by those that are little bit more security aware.

Unfortunately, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by lower-level decryption algorithms these days (including cipher suites that are exportable) – all by using a dummy browser as a bit of a “man in the middle” security trick.

The exploit convinces the system to produce a very weak export key, the kind of export keys that comes in at lower than 512 bits.

This can be factored out using Amazon systems in less than 12 hours (for less than $100) – cracking systems maintained by the federal government (including the FBI, NSA, and CIA) as well as some of the biggest businesses on the planet.

Talk about a security threat, right!

## FREAK Risk Audit – Finding Your Level of Vulnerability

Finding your level of vulnerability to these specific kinds of attacks can be a little bit challenging, if only because there are so many websites, so many servers, and so many platforms that are running OpenSSL with these types of vulnerabilities in the first place.

Sure, some platforms turn off all cipher suites completely (including platforms like Facebook) – but the overwhelming majority of platforms out there running OpenSSL are not even aware of these vulnerabilities in the first place.

A number of platforms have decided to rollout server wide updates to patch and disable the cipher suites in recent years. Many of them have enjoyed considerable success, but there are still a lot of platforms out there that maintain these vulnerabilities even to this day.

Anything running OpenSSL version 1.01k (or anything earlier) have these kinds of vulnerabilities, as well as anything running BoringSSL versions before the November 10, 2014 update.

Secured Transport, S Channel, LibReSSL, Mono, and even IBM JSSE versions all have these kinds of vulnerabilities “baked right in” as well.

Some of the most popular web browsers under the sun are also quite vulnerable to these types of attacks.

Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Android Browser, Blackberry Browser, and the Cisco browser are all easily exploited with the FREAK attack.

The most important thing you can do to shore up your defenses against this kind of attack is to make sure that your web browsers are patched, upgraded, and as up to date as humanly possible.

It’s a good idea to make sure that the same web browsers have automatic updates turned on as well, guaranteeing that you automatically have the latest version of these browsers downloaded and installed on your devices so that you don’t have to do this kind of maintenance on your own moving forward.

Of course, it’s also a good idea to make sure that you aren’t doing anything involving sensitive information or data on networks that are not totally secured.

You don’t want to bank, pay bills, or access sensitive information on open or public networks – like at the coffee shop, the airport, or the library.

This is the kind of work you only ever want to do on a totally secured network, ideally one that you have complete and total control over as far as the admin capabilities are concerned.

Finally, make sure that if you are connecting to any website that has HTTPS protocols in place that it allows for export cipher suites.

Websites that do not have this feature enabled are significantly more vulnerable than others.

It takes only a couple of seconds to click the little lock button in your web browser to confirm the status of the connection on the sites and servers you are connecting to. Take the time to make this a real habit, digging deep into the information provided by the servers you’re looking to transmit sensitive information across, and you won’t have to worry about huge cyber vulnerabilities compromising your information quite as much.

The information throughout this guide won’t completely protect you from these types of attacks in the future (more TLS vulnerabilities are being discovered on a regular basis) but you’ll certainly be better protected than you were previously.

As far as we can tell, this can be interpreted as a request for CVE
IDs for vulnerabilities in Mono, which has its own independent SSL/TLS
implementation.

The message is about three patches, but the patches are mentioned with
inconsistent terminology. What we think was meant is:

<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4>

The commit message says "TLS protocol: add handshake state validation"
but this is also referenced as "The Impersonation patch" and "A TLS
impersonation attack was discovered in Mono's TLS stack by researchers
at Inria." Although there isn't a description of what impersonation
vulnerability existed, almost certainly it is "SKIP-TLS ... Mono:
default TLS library vulnerable to client impersonation. Version 3.12.1
prevents the attack" as listed on the <https://www.smacktls.com> web
site.

<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/9c38772f094168d8bfd5bc73bf8925cd04faad10>

The commit message says "Remove the EXPORT ciphers and related code
path" - this directly matches "The EXPORT cipher removal patch" but it
is apparently also referenced as "FREAK patch" and "vulnerability to
FREAK." (It is conceivable that
1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4 would also be applicable to
FREAK attacks.)

<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b>

The commit message says "Remove the client-side SSLv2 fallback," which
apparently matches both "SSLv2 support" and "SSLv2 patch." MITRE does
currently accept reports from authors of SSL/TLS code who want to
characterize their own SSLv2 support, after a recent drop of support,
as a vulnerability (i.e., "These vulnerabilities affect ..." in
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/07/2> together with
<https://uk.linkedin.com/in/directhex>).

Use CVE-2015-2318 for the <https://www.smacktls.com> SKIP-TLS issue in
Mono.

Use CVE-2015-2319 for the <https://www.smacktls.com> FREAK issue in
Mono.

Use CVE-2015-2320 for b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b.

# USN-2547-1: Mono vulnerabilities

24 March 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Mono.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [mono](/security/cves?package=mono) - Mono is a platform for running and developing applications

## Details

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation was vulnerable to the

SKIP-TLS vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to perform client impersonation attacks. ([CVE-2015-2318](/security/CVE-2015-2318))

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation was vulnerable to the

FREAK vulnerability. A remote attacker or a machine-in-the-middle could

possibly use this issue to force the use of insecure ciphersuites.

([CVE-2015-2319](/security/CVE-2015-2319))

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation still supported a

fallback to SSLv2. This update removes the functionality as use of SSLv2 is

known to be insecure. ([CVE-2015-2320](/security/CVE-2015-2320))

It was discovered that Mono incorrectly handled memory in certain

circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Mono to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or to obtain sensitive

information. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-0992](/security/CVE-2011-0992))

It was discovered that Mono incorrectly handled hash collisions. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Mono to crash, resulting in

a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3543](/security/CVE-2012-3543))

    That was still useful in 2003/2004 but the technical and legal landscape
    changed a lot since then. Removing the old, limited key size, cipher
    suites also allow removed additional parts of the code that deals with
    them.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3202-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : mono
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2318 CVE-2015-2319 CVE-2015-2320
Debian Bug     : 780751

Researchers at INRIA and Xamarin discovered several vulnerabilities in
mono, a platform for running and developing applications based on the
ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono's TLS stack contained several problems that
hampered its capabilities: those issues could lead to client
impersonation (via SKIP-TLS), SSLv2 fallback, and encryption weakening
(via FREAK).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.8.1-8+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.8+dfsg-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.
