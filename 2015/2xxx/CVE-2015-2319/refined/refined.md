Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2319:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an implementation flaw in Mono's TLS stack that incorrectly allowed the message sequence of export cipher suites to be used even when a non-export cipher suite was negotiated. This is related to the "FREAK" attack.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **FREAK (Factoring RSA Export Keys) Vulnerability:** Mono's TLS implementation was vulnerable to the FREAK attack, which allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force the use of weak export-grade RSA cipher suites. These export cipher suites use deliberately weak keys (less than 512 bits), which can be factored relatively easily, allowing the attacker to decrypt the communication.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept the TLS handshake, downgrade the connection to a weak export cipher suite, and then decrypt the traffic, leading to:
    *   **Server Impersonation:** The attacker can impersonate a legitimate server.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the encrypted communication.
    *   **Widespread XSS attacks:** By compromising servers hosting third party Javascript (e.g Facebook SDK) attackers can inject arbitrary Javascript into many sites.
*   **Compromised User Data:** The attacker can steal sensitive information such as passwords and other data entered on websites.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attack requires a network attacker who can intercept and modify TLS handshake messages. This can be done through various methods such as:
    *   DNS Tampering (DNS rebinding or domain name seizure)
    *   Compromised Network Infrastructure

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and a server. This can be achieved through:
    *   Being on the same network as the victim (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
    *   Compromising network infrastructure.
    *   DNS manipulation.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify TLS handshake messages, and factor the 512 bit RSA keys.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of export cipher suites, which were intentionally made weak to comply with outdated regulations.
*   The vulnerability is due to state machine issues where implementations incorrectly allow export ciphersuites even when a non-export cipher was negotiated.
*   Affected Mono versions include basically all versions released before the fix.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves removing support for weak export cipher suites.
