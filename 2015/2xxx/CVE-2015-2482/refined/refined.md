{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition in the JScript engine when handling regular expressions. Specifically, recompiling a regular expression during a replace operation can cause the code to reuse a freed string if the string is freed from the cache by allocating and freeing a number of strings of certain size.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web page using Internet Explorer.",
       "Embedding an ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine to direct the user to a specially crafted website."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious web page or file with embedded malicious code that exploits the vulnerability. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability."
