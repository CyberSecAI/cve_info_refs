Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Mobile Devices C4 OBD2 dongle has hard-coded SSH usernames and passwords that are the same across all devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of static, hard-coded credentials for accessing the device via SSH. This means all devices share the same login credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who knows these hard-coded credentials can gain unauthorized access to any C4 dongle.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device and potentially lead to vehicle damage or passenger injury.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The device has a number of services (telnet, ssh, http) accessible remotely. An attacker could connect to the device via SSH over the network using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Remote:**  Since the device is connected to the cellular network, the attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the hard-coded SSH username and password.
*   The attacker needs network connectivity to the targeted device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor claims this was a flaw only in developer devices and has been fixed in production, but CERT/CC notes that it is not clear if all customers have been informed and updated.
*  The document also highlights other vulnerabilities in the same device such as missing authentication for critical functions, use of hard-coded cryptographic keys, improper authorization via SMS and insufficient verification of data authenticity.
