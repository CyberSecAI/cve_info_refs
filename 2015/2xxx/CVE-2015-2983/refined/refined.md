Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the `admin.php` file of the Photo Gallery CMS. This allows an attacker to perform unintended actions on behalf of a logged-in user. Additionally, there is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to `jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate user actions if they visit a malicious page while logged into the application.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability in `jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js` allows injection of arbitrary script through a crafted link, leading to execution of the script on a victim's browser. This is triggered when using the lightbox feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF:** An attacker can perform unintended operations, potentially including modifying or deleting data, on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **XSS:** Arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, which may lead to information theft, session hijacking, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The CSRF attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page, which will then send a forged request to the vulnerable application.
- The XSS attack vector involves tricking a user to click on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious web page or link that will trigger the vulnerability when visited by a logged-in user. 
- The attacker does not need to have prior authentication to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a link or visiting the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The XSS vulnerability is only exploitable when the "lightbox" feature is used.
- The vendor has released a patch that involves replacing the `admin.php` file.
- The report also mentions that multiple complex conditions need to be met to trigger the vulnerability.
