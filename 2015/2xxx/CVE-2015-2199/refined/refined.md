Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2199:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `wp_ajax_save_item()` function in the WonderPlugin Audio Player plugin does not properly sanitize the `$id` parameter when calling the `is_id_exist()` function. This lack of sanitization leads to a SQL injection vulnerability. Additionally, input fields like `item[name]` and `item[customcss]` are not properly sanitized, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `$id` parameter. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries through this parameter.
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is also vulnerable to stored XSS through the `name` and `customcss` fields. Malicious JavaScript can be injected, which will be executed when an admin views the player settings page or when the shortcode is used on the frontend.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database or modify data by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, or redirect to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** By sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wonderplugin_audio_save_item` with a malicious SQL query in the `item[id]` parameter.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wonderplugin_audio_save_item` with malicious JavaScript code in the `item[name]` or `item[customcss]` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to have a registered user account on the vulnerable WordPress site. Admin privileges are not required to exploit these vulnerabilities, which means standard users can exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit was discovered and reported by Kacper Szurek on January 20, 2015.
*   The vulnerable version of the plugin is 2.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates both the blind SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities, making it easier to understand and reproduce the attack.
*   The exploit provides a proof-of-concept using a simple form submission.
