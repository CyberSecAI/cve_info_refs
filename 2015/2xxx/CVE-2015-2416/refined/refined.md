- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user input by Microsoft Windows OLE.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Windows OLE.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker, after successfully exploiting another vulnerability for remote code execution, could exploit these OLE vulnerabilities to run arbitrary code at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user). This could lead to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited after another vulnerability allowing for remote code execution is exploited. The vulnerability is present in Windows OLE.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code using another vulnerability to then exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be a user with limited privileges.
