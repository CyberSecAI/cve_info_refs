## Vulnerabilities in OLE Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3072633)

Published: July 14, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allows arbitrary code to be run. Once the other vulnerability has been exploited, an attacker could then exploit the vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin to cause arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how user input is validated. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3072633](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3072633).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple OLE Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exists in Microsoft Windows OLE when it fails to properly validate user input. The vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. The vulnerabilities would have to be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allows remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could allow a user with limited privileges on an affected system to execute code at a medium integrity level.

An attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code. An attacker could then, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how user input is validated.

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OLE Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2416](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2416) | No | No |
| OLE Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2417](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2417) | No | No |
