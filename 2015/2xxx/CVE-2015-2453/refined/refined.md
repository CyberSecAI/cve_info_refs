  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-2453",
      "root_cause": "The Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) does not properly terminate a process when a user logs off.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Elevation of Privilege"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could run code designed to monitor the actions of a user who logs on to the system. This could disclose sensitive information such as logon credentials, which could be used to elevate privileges or execute code as a different user. If an administrator logs on, the attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker would first have to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application designed to continue running after the attacker logs off. When a new user logs on with their own credentials, the attacker's process could monitor all actions performed by the newly logged-on user.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to log on to the targeted system and be able to run a specially crafted malicious application. Systems with multiple users who can log on locally and run untrusted applications are at the most risk."
