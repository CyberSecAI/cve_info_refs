Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2796:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `search_for` parameter in ProjectPier-Core. This parameter is used in multiple search functionalities: `search_by_tag.php`, `search_contacts.php`, and `search.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `search_for` parameter) before displaying it in the web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the vulnerable pages.
*   **User Compromise:** By tricking a user into accessing a crafted URL with the malicious payload, an attacker could potentially:
    *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `search_for` parameter, and then lures a victim to visit the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, needing no special access to the server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice a user of the ProjectPier application to click on the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in the following files:
    * `application/views/dashboard/search_by_tag.php`
    * `application/views/dashboard/search_contacts.php`
    * `application/views/project/search.php`
* The fix involves sanitizing the `search_term` or `search_string` using a `clean()` function before displaying it to the user.

In summary, CVE-2015-2796 details an XSS vulnerability in ProjectPier-Core where unsanitized input from the `search_for` parameter can be used to inject malicious scripts, potentially compromising user accounts.
