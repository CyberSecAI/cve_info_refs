# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@jaydipdave](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2125086?u=8730ee4db28ef0362f82e6e3e9bb264548f339d5&v=4&size=48)](/jaydipdave)[jaydipdave](https://github.com/jaydipdave)opened [on Mar 31, 2015](https://github.com/Project-Pier/ProjectPier-Core/issues/37#issue-65462558)

An attacker can pass this URL (with XSS payload) to a victim (user of ProjectPier) and can make the victim to perform some tasks or can infect the user. The vulnerability is XSS

<http://www.prop.com/public/index.php?c=project&a=search&active_project=1&search_for=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28420%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E>

The search\_for parameter is not getting sanitized. You can use [CVE-2015-2796](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x996-8947-j879 "CVE-2015-2796") cve-id in your announcements when you fix this vulnerability.

Thanks,

Jaydeep
