Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-2430:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of filesystem interactions by sandboxed applications within Microsoft Windows. Specifically, it involves the handling of junction points in the Favorites folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Filesystem Interaction:** The core weakness is that sandboxed applications are allowed to perform certain filesystem operations they should not be able to do.
*   **Junction Point Abuse:** The specific attack vector involves manipulating junction points within the Favorites folder. A low-rights process can create these junction points to redirect file operations to other folders, where the IE broker process will then modify the access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a low-rights process (such as an Internet Explorer process) to a medium integrity process.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the sandbox environment of the exploited application, potentially gaining access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page or File:** An attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains the exploit.
*   **Junction Point Creation:** The attacker's code running in the context of a low-rights process must set up a malicious junction point within the user's Favorites folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to execute code within a low-rights process, typically within a sandboxed application like Internet Explorer.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction to initiate the vulnerable application, by visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file.

**Additional Details (From ZDI Advisory):**
*  The vulnerability resides in how Internet Explorer handles junction points within the Favorites folder that link to other folders.
*  A low-rights process can create a junction point in the Favorites folder and, when the IE broker process changes the access control rights in targeted folders, it can achieve privilege escalation.

**Summary of Fix:**
* Microsoft addressed the vulnerability by preventing the improper interaction with the filesystem by sandboxed applications.

In summary, CVE-2015-2430 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, specifically related to how sandboxed applications can interact with the filesystem. By using a junction point in the favorites folder, a low-privilege attacker can escalate to medium integrity.
