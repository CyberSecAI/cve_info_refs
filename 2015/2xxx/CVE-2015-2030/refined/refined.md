Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from an inadequate account lockout setting within IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale. This means that the system does not sufficiently restrict the number of failed login attempts before locking an account, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Account Lockout:** The primary weakness is the lack of a robust account lockout mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** A remote attacker can repeatedly attempt login with different credentials without being effectively blocked.
- **Credential Compromise:** Successful brute-force attacks could allow an attacker to obtain valid account credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Data Modification (Potential):** While the CVE description specifies "I:P" (Partial Integrity Impact), the text mentions only an impact on credentials. The details of data modification depends on the access level provided by the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attack is launched remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the login interface of the affected IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale instance over the network.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not require any prior valid credentials or a valid user session to initiate the attack.
