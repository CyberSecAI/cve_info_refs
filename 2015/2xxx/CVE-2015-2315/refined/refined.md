Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2315:

**1. SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The WPML plugin, when processing HTTP POST requests with `action=wp-link-ajax`, determines the language by parsing the HTTP referer header. This language code is not validated or SQL-escaped before being used in a database query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and SQL escaping of user-controlled data (HTTP referer).
*   **Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to read any data in the database, including user details, password hashes, and other sensitive information. Access to other databases accessible by the web backend is also possible.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with the `action=wp-link-ajax` parameter, and a malicious SQL payload in the `referer` header.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**2. Page/Post/Menu Deletion**

*   **Root Cause:** The "menu sync" function in WPML lacks access control.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Missing authorization checks on a function that modifies database content.
*   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can delete posts, pages, and menus.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `menus-sync.php` page with a `sync` parameter containing a delete command.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**3. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*  **Root Cause:** The "reminder popup" code does not validate login status or a nonce.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, and authorization checks on code that handles user-provided data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in an administrator's browser, which in a WordPress context, could lead to further compromise through plugin/theme editors.
*   **Attack Vector:** Directing users to a URL with a malicious javascript payload in the `target` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Requires the user to click on a crafted URL. If the user is an admin, it could lead to server-side compromise.

**4. Unauthenticated Administrative Function Execution**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect nonce validation where the code checks a nonce in the GET parameters but uses the POST parameters for the actual action.
*   **Weaknesses:** Inconsistent use of request parameters, weak nonce check logic.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass the nonce check if they have a valid nonce from another plugin, and then execute any of the administrative AJAX functions within WPML, potentially leading to complete website compromise. This includes the ability to include arbitrary files (including remote ones) which could allow for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with a valid nonce in the GET parameter, and a malicious WPML administrative action in POST parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Requires a valid nonce from another plugin or the core system to bypass the initial nonce check. This vulnerability may not be exploitable if there are no plugins that generate nonces for unauthenticated users (e.g. bbpress).

**5. Reflected XSS via HTTP Referer**

*   **Root Cause:** The code that handles the “action=sample-permalink” POST parameter echoes back the HTTP referer header without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization of the HTTP referer header.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a user who submits the form.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with `action=sample-permalink`, using a crafted referer header containing malicious JavaScript.
*    **Required Capabilities:** Requires the user to submit a form while having a crafted referer header

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

The content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WPML plugin, including SQL injection, arbitrary content deletion, reflected XSS, unauthenticated admin function execution, and reflected XSS via the referer header. These issues arise from a lack of input validation, access control, and insecure coding practices. Exploitation can range from database information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
