- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Office software fails to properly validate templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper template validation in Microsoft Office.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Email Attack**: Attacker sends a specially crafted template file to the user and convinces them to open it.
    - **Web-based Attack**: Attacker hosts a website or file share with a malicious template and convinces the user to access it.
    - **Man-in-the-middle attack**: An attacker intercepts traffic and modifies template contents to include malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to create a malicious template file.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious template through email, a website or a man-in-the-middle attack.
