```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists due to the way the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
Attack vectors: The attacker must log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the system to log in, and the capability to execute a specially crafted application.
