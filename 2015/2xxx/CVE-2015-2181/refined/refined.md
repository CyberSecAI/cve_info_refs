The content is related to CVE-2015-2181.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the Roundcube Password plugin's DBMail driver. Specifically, the `newpass` parameter is directly passed to the `exec()` function without proper escaping or validation, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: Unsanitized user input (`newpass`) is passed to the `exec()` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- Privilege Escalation: The `chgdbmailusers` program is executed with root privileges, compounding the command injection vulnerability as the injected commands also run as root.
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `chgdbmailusers` program if a password or username longer than 255 chars is used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- Privilege Escalation: The injected commands are run with root privileges, allowing an attacker to take full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user logs into roundcube and modifies the password to inject shell commands

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a valid user account on the Roundcube webmail system and the password plugin enabled with the DBMail driver configured.
- They must be able to access the web interface of the Roundcube mail application.
