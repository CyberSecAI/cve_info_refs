Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in Huawei's Security Advisory SA No:Huawei-SA-20150213-01-Smartphone, which is associated with CVE-2015-2246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control within the MeWidget plug-in of Huawei's Emotion UI. Specifically, the MeWidget module on Huawei P7 smartphones doesn't properly restrict access to contact information that users may have bound to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The MeWidget plug-in fails to implement proper access controls, allowing third-party applications to read contact information (name and URI) bound to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain the names and URIs of mobile phone users' contacts. This information can potentially be used for further malicious activities like phishing or social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware Installation:** An attacker must trick the user into installing malicious software (malware) on their Huawei P7 smartphone.
- **Third-Party Application:** The malware, once installed, can access the contact data via the vulnerable MeWidget plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malware Development/Distribution:** The attacker needs to develop or obtain malicious software capable of exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to install the malicious app on their device.
- **Device Access:**  The attacker needs their malicious app to have been installed on the targeted device.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Huawei P7 smartphones running versions V100R001C00B136 and earlier.
- Huawei has released a fix in version V100R001C00B159.
