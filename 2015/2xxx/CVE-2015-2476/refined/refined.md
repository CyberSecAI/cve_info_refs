- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Microsoft WebDAV client explicitly allows the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 2.0, which is a deprecated and insecure protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the WebDAV client's support for SSL 2.0, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt portions of encrypted traffic by forcing an SSL 2.0 session, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to force the WebDAV client into an SSL 2.0 session with a vulnerable server (i.e. one that has SSL 2.0 enabled). The attack requires a man-in-the-middle position to decrypt traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic (MitM) between the client and the server. They also need to be able to force the WebDAV client to use the vulnerable SSL 2.0 protocol with a WebDAV server that has it enabled.
