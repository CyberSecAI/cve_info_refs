## Vulnerability in WebDAV Could Allow Information Disclosure (3076949)

Published: August 11, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker forces an encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 2.0 session with a WebDAV server that has SSL 2.0 enabled and uses a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack to decrypt portions of the encrypted traffic.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Itanium servers and Windows 10, which are not affected. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the Microsoft Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client defaults to more secure protocols than SSL 2.0. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3076949](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3076949).

## Vulnerability Information

## WebDAV Client Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2476

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client that is caused when it explicitly allows the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 2.0. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could decrypt portions of encrypted traffic.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could force an encrypted SSL 2.0 session with a WebDAV server that has SSL 2.0 enabled and use a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack to decrypt portions of the encrypted traffic. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the Microsoft WebDAV client defaults to more secure protocols than SSL 2.0.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
