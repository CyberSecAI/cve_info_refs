Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-2312, specifically in how the `totalSize()` method of the Cap'n Proto library handles object readers.
- It occurs when a crafted message with a struct list that has zero-sized elements is processed. When `totalSize()` is invoked, a tight loop is triggered that iterates up to 2^29 times, leading to excessive CPU consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CPU Usage Amplification:**  The primary weakness is the ability to trigger a "tight" loop via a small, crafted message, which leads to disproportionate CPU usage on the receiving end. This can occur when the application invokes the `totalSize()` method on an object reader.
- **Incomplete Fix:**  The vulnerability exists due to an overlooked case during the fix for CVE-2015-2312, highlighting the challenge in thoroughly addressing complex issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service by exhausting CPU resources on the receiving system. This can render the affected service or application unresponsive or significantly slow. The excessive CPU consumption can occur due to the tight loop in `totalSize()`.
- The attack does not consume RAM or other resources besides CPU.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Remote Peers:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted message to a vulnerable Cap'n Proto application. This message contains a struct list with zero-sized elements.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a receiving application invokes the `totalSize()` method on an object reader after receiving such a crafted message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages to a service or application that uses the vulnerable version of Cap'n Proto.
- **Message Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a message that exploits the vulnerability, by including a list of zero-sized struct elements.
- **No prior authentication is needed**: The attacker only needs to send a crafted message.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Renshaw and was a follow-up to the previously identified CPU amplification vulnerability (CVE-2015-2312).
*   The fix involves adjusting how the `totalSize()` method calculates size when dealing with lists of zero-sized elements.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Cap'n Proto before 0.4.1.2 and 0.5.x before 0.5.1.2.
*   The issue was addressed in commit `80149744bdafa3ad4eedc83f8ab675e27baee868`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered via fuzz testing, and the fix ensures that extended testing with American Fuzzy Lop will identify similar issues as failures.
