    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data, and potentially complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exploitable via POST requests to `/index.php?option=com_ecommercewd&controller=products&task=displayproducts` by manipulating the `search_category_id`, `sort_order`, and `filter_manufacturer_ids` parameters.",
