Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the F21 JWT (JSON Web Token) PHP library, specifically how it verifies token signatures. The library fails to properly verify the signatures of JWTs, making it possible to bypass the verification process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Signature Verification:** The core issue is that the JWT library does not correctly validate the signatures of the tokens. This means that an attacker could create a specially crafted token that would be incorrectly accepted as valid by the library, even if the signature does not correspond to the actual token data and key.
*   **Algorithm parameter not correctly used during verification:** The code changes in the provided github diff show the `decode` and `verifySignature` functions were changed to use a supplied `$algo` parameter instead of the algorithm found in the JWT header. This would allow an attacker to use a symmetric signing algorithm, using the same key as an asymmetric algorithm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By crafting a token with a false signature, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms that rely on the JWT library for verification.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise:** An attacker could potentially alter the payload of a JWT and forge a signature, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious data, if the application uses the JWT contents to make decisions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JWT:** Attackers would need to generate a custom JSON Web Token with a manipulated signature.
*   **Token Injection:** An attacker needs to provide the crafted JWT to an application using the vulnerable JWT library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to generate/modify JWTs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft JWTs with manipulated signatures. They would need to have a working knowledge of how JWTs are structured and signed.
*   **Access to the application using vulnerable library:** The attacker needs to be able to send or inject the crafted JWT into an application that is using the vulnerable version of the library for authentication/authorization purposes.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in F21 JWT versions prior to 2.0.
*   The fix involves changes to the `decode` and `verifySignature` functions in the `JWT.php` file to properly verify the JWT signature based on the supplied algorithm. The provided GitHub commit shows this fix.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Toshiharu Sugiyama and Shuntaro Maeda.

This information is more detailed than the initial CVE description which just mentions that there is a vulnerability relating to signature verification.
