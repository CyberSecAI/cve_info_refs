{
  "CVE-2015-2312": {
    "root_cause": "The Cap'n Proto list pointer format allows encoding a list where elements are claimed to have a size of zero. Such a list could claim a large number of elements while taking very little space on the wire. The receiving application might then iterate through and handle each element, consuming a lot of time and resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CPU usage amplification vulnerability",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote peers can cause a denial of service (CPU and possibly general resource consumption) by sending a crafted message with a large list of zero-sized elements.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted messages with large lists of zero-sized elements sent remotely."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to send crafted messages to a vulnerable Cap'n Proto application.",
     "more_details": "The vulnerability exists because the receiver iterates through the list, performing operations on each element, which takes time and resources. The core issue is that the size of the list, as indicated in the message, does not correspond to the actual data sent over the wire."
