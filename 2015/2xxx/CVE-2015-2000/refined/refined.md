Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2000:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of a `Serializable` class within the Jumio Android SDK. This class contains a native pointer (`swigCPtr`) that is not marked as `transient`. The `finalize` method of this class calls a native function, passing this attacker-controlled pointer. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is due to the lack of proper handling of deserialized objects, specifically failing to prevent the attacker from controlling native pointers.
- **Non-transient Native Pointer:** The `swigCPtr` member, which is a pointer to native memory, is not declared as `transient`. This means it gets serialized and deserialized, allowing an attacker to control its value.
- **Finalize Method Abuse:** The `finalize` method of the vulnerable class is automatically invoked by the garbage collector (GC) during object cleanup. This method then uses the attacker-controlled pointer leading to exploitation.
- **SWIG-Generated Code:** The vulnerability was found to be present in code generated by SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) when developers used bad configurations, and SWIG failed to generate robust code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the vulnerable Jumio SDK. This is done by controlling the native pointer, which leads to a controlled crash, and by using this crash to further control program execution by setting the program counter (PC) to an address of the attacker's choice.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By achieving code execution in an application with elevated privileges (like the `system_server` process), an attacker could perform actions such as replacing other apps with malware, changing SELinux policies, or even loading arbitrary kernel modules.
- **Data Manipulation:** The exploit can be used to modify data in the remote process through constrained "write-what-where" primitives.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The vulnerability is triggered when an application receives a serialized object containing the malicious pointer via Android's IPC mechanisms, such as Intents and Bundles.
- **Intent Extra:** An attacker could send a malicious `Serializable` object within an Intent's extras. When the receiving app touches the extras, the object will be deserialized, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send Intents:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted Intent to a vulnerable app or service. This can be achieved by the attacker having an app installed on the device, or being able to trick a trusted app into sending the intent.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Class:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable class in the Jumio SDK and how to craft a malicious serialized object.
- **Understanding of the target architecture (ARM) to create an exploit:** Creating a full exploit requires knowledge of ARM assembly and the target operating system.

**Additional Notes**
- The content goes into detail on how an exploit was crafted, using Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques and bypassing ASLR.
- The content also touches upon other vulnerable SDKs and applications using similar vulnerable patterns, showing that the root problem was present across a few popular SDKs and that developers should be aware of 3rd party SDK vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with serialization of data.
- It highlights the importance of the `transient` keyword when serializing objects that contain pointers or other non-serializable resources, the issues of not using a lazy approach to deserialization and of the usage of SWIG.
- A mitigation for this issue involves marking the `swigCPtr` field as transient.
