Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2272:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `login/token.php` file not verifying if the `auth_forcepasswordchange` setting is active for a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Authentication Check:** The `login/token.php` script fails to check if a user is required to change their password upon login due to the `auth_forcepasswordchange` setting being enabled.
*   **Temporary Password Extension:** This flaw allows users with a temporary password (that they are forced to change) to bypass the password change requirement. They can use the temporary password to create a web service token.
*   **Web Services Token Creation Bypass:** The vulnerability can be used to generate web service tokens using the temporary password, effectively extending the lifespan and usability of this temporary password beyond its intended validity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Forced Password Change:** Users can bypass the forced password change, which is a security mechanism designed to ensure the use of strong or newly generated passwords.
*   **Prolonged Use of Temporary Credentials:** Attackers can create tokens with temporary passwords, potentially allowing them to maintain access to user accounts longer than intended.
*  **Abuse of Web Services:** The created tokens could be used to gain access to the users account via web services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Services API:** An attacker would need to interact with the Moodle web services API, specifically the `login/token.php` script.
*   **Exploitation of Temporary Passwords:** The attack leverages a user account that has been forced to change passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Moodle Account:** The attacker must have a valid Moodle user account where the password change is forced by the `auth_forcepasswordchange` setting
*   **Network Access to Moodle Instance:** The attacker needs network access to the Moodle instance in order to interact with the web services API.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 2.8 to 2.8.3, 2.7 to 2.7.5, and 2.6 to 2.6.8 (and earlier unsupported versions) are affected.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The issue was resolved in Moodle versions 2.8.4, 2.7.6, and 2.6.9.
*   **Severity:**  The issue is rated as "Serious".
*   **Issue ID:** The Moodle issue tracker ID is MDL-48691.
*  **Code Change:** The specific code changes can be found at: `http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-48691`
