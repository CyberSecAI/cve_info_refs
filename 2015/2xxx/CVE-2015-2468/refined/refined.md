Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2468

**Description:** Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Office fails to properly handle objects in memory. Specifically, a crafted document can cause an arbitrary free when closing the document in affected versions of Microsoft Office.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory
- Arbitrary free vulnerability triggered during document close

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system.
- Potential actions include installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** Sending a specially crafted file to a user and convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based Attack:** Hosting a website or using a compromised website that contains a specially crafted file, and then convincing users to click a link to download/open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- Ability to deliver the file to the victim. This can be done through email, hosting it on a website, or via other file sharing methods.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious document.

**Additional details from Exploit-DB:**
- The vulnerability was observed in Microsoft Office 2007 with the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-In disabled.
- A specific memory address needs to be sprayed with a chosen address that will be later freed.
- The `mso.dll` version 12.0.6721.5000 is mentioned as vulnerable

The document also mentions that this is one of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities, and the update addresses the issue by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.
