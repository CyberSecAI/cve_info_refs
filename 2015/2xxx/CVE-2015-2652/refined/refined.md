Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2652:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2015-2652 – Unauthenticated File Upload in Oracle E-business Suite", which confirms it is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated file upload functionality within the Oracle Marketing component of Oracle E-Business Suite. Specifically, the `amsImageUpload.jsp` file allows arbitrary file uploads without proper authentication checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The primary weakness is that the file upload mechanism does not require any form of authentication, allowing anyone to upload files.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The system does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, enabling the upload of any file type, including executables.
- **File Execution:** The uploaded files can be potentially executed on the server.
- **Table Space Exhaustion:** Uploaded files are stored in a database table, potentially allowing an attacker to exhaust available table space by uploading large files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can upload and execute malicious code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading a large number of files, attackers can fill up the database tablespace, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Data Breaches:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the Oracle E-Business Suite.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `amsImageUpload.jsp` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request body is constructed using multipart/form-data, which includes the file to be uploaded.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite server over the network.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not require any valid user account or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with multipart/form-data.

**Technical Details from the content:**
- The vulnerable URLs are:
   - `<http://ORACLE-WebServer:Port/OA_HTML/amsImageSelect.jsp>`
   - `<http://ORACLE-WebServer:Port/OA_HTML/amsImageUpload.jsp>`

- A sample `curl` command used for exploitation is provided which demonstrates how to upload an arbitrary file.
