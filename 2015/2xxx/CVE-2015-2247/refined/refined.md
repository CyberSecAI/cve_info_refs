{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper security measures in the Bluetooth communication protocol used by Boosted brand electric skateboards and their controllers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Bluetooth signal between the controller and the skateboard can be blocked, allowing an attacker to force the skateboard to pair with a malicious device (laptop).",
      "Failed encryption of the communication protocol allowed attackers to emulate the legitimate controller and send arbitrary commands to the skateboard."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation allows an attacker to remotely hijack and control the skateboard while it is in motion, potentially causing the rider to crash. Attackers could control acceleration and braking and cause a 'bucking bull' state.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is conducted over Bluetooth. An attacker can use a laptop or similar device with Bluetooth capability to intercept and manipulate the communication between the skateboard and its controller.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the skateboard. They also require the ability to block the legitimate controller's Bluetooth signal, and possess knowledge of the vulnerable Bluetooth protocol to emulate a controller."
