  "CVE-2015-2293": {
    "Description": "The WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast version 1.7.3.3 and earlier is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection. The vulnerability exists in the 'admin/class-bulk-editor-list-table.php' file where the orderby and order GET parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. An authenticated attacker with author, editor, or admin privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating these parameters.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient sanitization of the orderby and order GET parameters before being used in a SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection",
      "Lack of CSRF protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the victim's WordPress database. This can lead to various malicious activities, including adding a new administrative user, compromising the entire website, data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `admin.php` page with specific `page`, `type`, `orderby`, and `order` parameters. This can be achieved by enticing an authenticated user to click a malicious link or visit a controlled webpage.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. The targeted user must be logged into the WordPress site with at least author-level privileges."
