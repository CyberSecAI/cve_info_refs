Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-2740:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `nsXMLHttpRequest::AppendToResponseText` function within Mozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird. This function, responsible for appending data to a response text buffer, fails to adequately manage buffer sizes when concatenating text leading to the possibility of writing past the allocated memory. Additionally, there's a similar issue within `ArrayBufferBuilder::append` where a length check can be bypassed via integer overflow allowing for out-of-bounds writes. A similar overflow issue also exists within `nsXMLHttpRequest::SendAsBinary`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs due to improper size calculations and memory allocation in several functions of the browser engine and `nsXMLHttpRequest`. These overflows can lead to memory corruption.
-   **Integer Overflow:** The `ArrayBufferBuilder::append` function is vulnerable to integer overflows due to a weak check on the combined buffer length, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
-   **Use-After-Free:** While this CVE primarily discusses overflows, the related SUSE advisory indicates that other memory safety issues such as use-after-free were also fixed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to crash by triggering the buffer overflow or use-after-free, leading to a denial of service.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting input to trigger the overflows, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical memory regions, allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
-   **Information Disclosure**: The out-of-bounds read in `YCbCrImageDataDeserializer::ToDataSourceSurface` could lead to the reading of random memory values

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by enticing a user to open a specially crafted web page or a link. The attacker would have to control the content provided in the response of an XMLHttpRequest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to have the victim load a malicious web page or cause other browser actions that will trigger an XMLHttpRequest with a crafted response.
-   **Limited Control:** The attacker needs to have some control over data being sent through an XMLHttpRequest, particularly its size, to trigger the overflow.
-   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, typically to entice the user to load a malicious web page or execute the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Information:**

-   This CVE is associated with the "Logjam" issue, which refers to a cryptographic weakness in Diffie-Hellmann key exchange. This content is not about the Logjam vulnerability itself, which is tracked under CVE-2015-4000.
-   The vulnerability has been addressed in various Mozilla products like Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird, along with several SUSE Linux Enterprise products and openSUSE distributions.
-   The SUSE security advisory indicates a critical severity for this issue, although the NVD scores it as a 10, which is the highest possible score.

This analysis is based on the collective information from the provided documents. The core problem lies within the memory management of string operations within the browser's handling of data received over XMLHttpRequest, making the system susceptible to overflows and their consequences.
