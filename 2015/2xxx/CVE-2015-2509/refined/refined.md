{
  "CVE-2015-2509": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to how Windows Media Center handles Media Center Link (.mcl) files.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of specially crafted .mcl files"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the current user.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "An attacker crafts a malicious .mcl file",
        "The attacker then lures a user to open the crafted .mcl file, which references malicious code",
        "The malicious code from an attacker-controlled location is then executed."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted .mcl file."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of .mcl files within Windows Media Center, specifically when they contain a UNC path.",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "Unsafe handling of UNC paths in .mcl files"
        ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution via automatic download of a remote file specified in the UNC path.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Craft a .mcl file with a UNC path pointing to a malicious executable",
        "Entice the user to open the crafted .mcl file"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host the malicious executable on a network share accessible to the victim and create a .mcl file with a reference to it."
