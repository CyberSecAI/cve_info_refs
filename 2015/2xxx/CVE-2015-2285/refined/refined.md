Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/etc/cron.daily/upstart` script in Ubuntu Vivid 1504 (development branch) executes with root privileges and processes user-controlled data from `/run/user/[uid]/upstart/sessions/*` without proper sanitization. Specifically, the script uses `env $(cat $session)` which allows users to inject arbitrary environment variables and commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation/sanitization of the content from session files.  The script directly uses the content of the file within an `env` command, allowing users to insert arbitrary commands.
*   **User-Writable Location:** The `/run/user/[uid]` directory and its subdirectories, including the location of session files, are writable by the user.
*   **Privileged Execution:** The cron job executes the script as root, meaning the injected commands run with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can achieve root-level code execution.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute any arbitrary command on the system with root privileges. This allows for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attacker must have local access to the system as a regular user.
*   **Session File Modification:** The attacker creates a malicious session file in their `/run/user/[uid]/upstart/sessions/` directory. This file contains the commands they wish to execute as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on a vulnerable Ubuntu Vivid 1504 system.
*   The attacker must be able to create and modify files within their `/run/user/[uid]` directory.
*   The attacker needs to wait for the daily cron job to execute, or trigger it manually to gain root.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability only affects Ubuntu Vivid 1504 and not Ubuntu Touch, because in Ubuntu Touch upstart is PID 1.
* A fix was released in `upstart 1.13.2-0ubuntu9` which ensures the session uid matches that of the session file to prevent log rotation of another users logs.
* A security researcher noted that permission checks in the patch could be racy, however, a maintainer noted that the grep command used to extract specific variable is more important part of this patch.
