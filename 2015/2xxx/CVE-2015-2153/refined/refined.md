{
  "CVE-2015-2153": {
    "Description": "The rpki_rtr_pdu_print function in print-rpki-rtr.c in the TCP printer in tcpdump before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) via a crafted header length in an RPKI-RTR Protocol Data Unit (PDU).",
    "Root cause": "Missing length check in the `rpki_rtr_pdu_print()` function when processing RPKI-RTR PDUs with an incorrect header length.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted RPKI-RTR Protocol Data Units (PDUs) injected into the network traffic monitored by tcpdump.",
      "Crafted pcap file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Remote unauthenticated user",
       "Able to inject crafted network packets into the network segment where tcpdump is running or provide a specially crafted pcap file."
    ],
    "Affected versions": "tcpdump versions before 4.7.2, including 4.6.2, 4.5.1, 4.4.0, and 4.3.0"
    ,
    "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerable function attempts to operate on invalid data due to the missing length check leading to invalid memory reads/writes, or general memory corruption.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered only when tcpdump is running in verbose mode"
    ]
  }
}
