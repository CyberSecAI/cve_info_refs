Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2289

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper escaping of category names within the Serendipity CMS backend. Specifically, the `{$entry_cat.category_name}` variable was not being properly sanitized when displayed in the category selection area of the entry admin page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper escaping allowed for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through specially crafted category names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with the ability to create categories (authenticated editors) could inject malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript would be executed in the browsers of other backend users (editors), when those users access the entry admin page. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking of other backend users.
    - Defacement of backend pages.
    - Privilege escalation within the CMS if an admin were to be targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated editor crafting a category name containing malicious JavaScript code. When other users view entries within the backend, this malicious code would be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with editor privileges within the Serendipity CMS to create or modify categories.
- The attacker needs to have access to the backend.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Edric Teo.
- The fix was implemented by escaping the category name using `{$entry_cat.category_name|escape}` in the `templates/2k11/admin/entries.tpl` file.
- Serendipity version 2.0 was affected, and the fix was released in version 2.0.1.
- The vendor considered the impact to be medium since it requires an authenticated editor to perform, however it affects other editors of the blog.
