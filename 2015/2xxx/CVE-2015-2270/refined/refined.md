Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2270:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how custom Moodle themes handle block regions in the base layout. When a custom theme uses blocks regions in the base layout, blocks for inaccessible courses may be displayed. This leads to the exposure of sensitive, course-related information to unauthorized users. The core issue is that blocks are being displayed for courses that the user should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of course information to users who should not have access, violating the principle of least privilege.
- **Improper Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to view details related to restricted courses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users, including guest users, can view sensitive course-related information for courses they are not enrolled in. This could include details about course content, participants, activities, or other material intended to be restricted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves accessing a Moodle instance using a custom theme. Specifically, it targets instances where the custom theme utilizes block regions in the base layout, which makes the blocks from inaccessible courses visible.
- A guest or unprivileged user could potentially browse the site and view information related to courses they have not enrolled in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be a guest user or any user not enrolled in the course.
- The attacker needs no special privileges or system access beyond accessing the Moodle instance through a web browser.
- The Moodle instance must be using a custom theme that exposes the vulnerability. Majority of the themes, including all standard Moodle themes, are not affected.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Minor" in terms of severity/risk.
- The issue was reported by Sam Hemelryk and is tracked internally as MDL-48804.
- The affected Moodle versions range from 2.8 to 2.8.3, 2.7 to 2.7.5, 2.6 to 2.6.8 and earlier unsupported versions. The fix is included in versions 2.8.4, 2.7.6, and 2.6.9.
