- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow in the ActiveX control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by enticing a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file containing the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or distribute a malicious file. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the target's system. The user needs to interact with the malicious content.
