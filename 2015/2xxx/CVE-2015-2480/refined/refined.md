- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the RyuJIT compiler improperly optimizing certain parameters, leading to a code generation error.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper code optimization by the RyuJIT compiler.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected system, allowing an attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to host a specially crafted .NET application and convince users to run it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious .NET application and convince a user to execute it. There is no way for the attacker to force execution.
