## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3086251)

Published: August 11, 2015 | Updated: September 25, 2015

**Version:** 1.2

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user runs a specially crafted .NET application. However, in all cases, an attacker would have no way to force users to run the application; an attacker would have to convince users to do so.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 on all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Itanium editions. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting RyuJIT compiler optimization for .NET Framework. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3086251](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3086251).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple RyuJIT Optimization Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft .NET Framework when the RyuJIT compiler improperly optimizes certain parameters resulting in a code generation error. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to host a specially crafted .NET application and convince users to run the application. However, in all cases, an attacker would have no way to force users to run the application; an attacker would have to convince users to do so. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting RyuJIT compiler optimization for .NET Framework.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability Title** | **CVE Number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RyuJIT Optimization Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2479](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2479) | No | No |
| RyuJIT Optimization Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2480](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2480) | No | No |
| RyuJIT Optimization Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2481](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2481) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) might be helpful in your situation:

* **Disable RyuJIT**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  1. Create a text file named **RyuJIT-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework]
     "useLegacyJit"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run **regedit.exe**.
  3. In Registry Editor, click **File** and then click **Import**.
  4. Navigate to and select the **RyuJIT-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

     (**Note:** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
  5. Click **Open** and then click **OK**.
  6. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

**Impact of workaround.** The legacy JIT compiler will be invoked in lieu of the RyuJIT compiler.

**How to undo the workaround.**

1. Create a text file named **RyuJIT-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework]
   "useLegacyJit"=dword:00000000

   ```
2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click **File** and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **RyuJIT-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

   (**Note:** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK**.
6. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.
