Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the hitSuji (rktSNS2) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.
- Specifically, the application does not adequately handle user-supplied data, making it susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input fields or parameters within the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into input fields or parameters of the web application, and then the victim must be induced to interact with the vulnerable part of the application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that an unauthenticated user can potentially perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in hitSuji (rktSNS2) version 0.2.2b.
- The vendor (rakuto.net) is unreachable, and no patch or fix is available.
- JPCERT/CC and IPA verified the existence of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was tested on various browsers, and it was found to be reproducible on multiple browsers.
