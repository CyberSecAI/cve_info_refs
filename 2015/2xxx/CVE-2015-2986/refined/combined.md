# JVN#24692261 hitSuji (rktSNS2) vulnetable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

hitSuji (rktSNS2) contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Vendor Information

Developer: rakuto.net

Product name and version: hitSuji (rktSNS2) 0.2.2b

## Description

hitSuji (rktSNS2) provided by rakuto.net is an open source SNS software. hitSuji (rktSNS2) contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Impact

An arbitrary script may be executed on the user's web browser.

## Solution

**Consider stop using hitSuji (rktSNS2) 0.2.2b**

Since the developer was unreachable, existence of any mitigations are unknown.

## Vendor Opinion

None provided

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on May 26, 2015, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability  shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Software Vulnerability Information and Others (Directive #110, 2014)](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/downloadfiles/140514kaiseikokuji.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](//www.ipa.go.jp/files/000044732.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 9 months) however there were no responses from the developer.  Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 6 separate emails (sent from October 27, 2008 to March 15, 2010)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer’s name (listed on September 29, 2011) and product name and its version (listed on December 16, 2011) in “[List of unreachable developers](http://jvn.jp/en/reply/index.html)” page on JVN.

   - No response to Announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on April 28, 2015)
2. Existence of vulnerability has been verified

   It was verified that the product contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability by IPA.  Arbitrary script execution on the user’s web browser was confirmed which violates the “Integrity” of the product.  For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.
3. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product

   In addition, according to the [Terms of Use](http://osdn.jp/projects/rktsns/scm/svn/tree/676/hitSuji/) available on the developer’s website, users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the cross-site scripting vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.
4. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access.

| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
