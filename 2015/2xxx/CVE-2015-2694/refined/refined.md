Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper tracking of client requests within the Kerberos kdcpreauth modules. Specifically, the OTP and PKINIT preauthentication mechanisms did not correctly validate requests before considering them pre-authenticated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Pre-authentication Handling (OTP):** The OTP kdcpreauth module would set the `TKT_FLG_PRE_AUTH` flag prematurely, before verifying the request.
*   **Incorrect Pre-authentication Handling (PKINIT):** The PKINIT kdcpreauth module would respond with a success code (0) even with empty input or an unconfigured realm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pre-authentication Bypass:** A remote attacker could bypass the `requires_preauth` flag on a client principal by exploiting the flawed logic in the OTP and PKINIT modules.
*   **Offline Password Cracking:**  By bypassing pre-authentication, an attacker could obtain a ciphertext encrypted with the principal's long-term key. This ciphertext could then be used to conduct an offline dictionary attack to guess the user's password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Specifically crafted requests:** The attacker would need to send specially crafted requests to the KDC, targeting either the OTP or PKINIT pre-authentication mechanisms, using zero bytes of data or an arbitrary realm name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).
*   **No Authentication Required Initially:**  The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated initially to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Knowledge of Target Realm:** The attacker would need to know the target realm, although the PKINIT module was vulnerable even to arbitrary realm names.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects MIT krb5 versions 1.12.x and 1.13.x before 1.13.2
*   The vulnerability is located in the `plugins/preauth/otp/main.c` and `plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c` files.

**Summary of Fixes:**

The fixes for this issue involve the following changes:

*   **OTP module:** The `TKT_FLG_PRE_AUTH` flag is only set after successful verification of the request.
*   **PKINIT module:** A successful response (code 0) is not sent on empty input or an unconfigured realm; instead, an error code is returned.
