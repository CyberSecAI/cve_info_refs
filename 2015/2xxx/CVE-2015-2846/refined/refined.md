Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2846

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how BitTorrent Sync handles URLs using the `btsync:` protocol.
*   **Weakness:**  The application improperly handles the `btsync:` protocol, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line parameters. These parameters are then passed to the `BTSync.exe` executable.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious link starting with `btsync:` and lures the victim into clicking it (e.g., by sending the link via email or hosting it on a web page). Alternatively, the victim could open a malicious file containing the specially crafted link.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine under the context of the user running BitTorrent Sync. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link with the `btsync:` protocol and persuade a user to click it. This can be done remotely, and no special privileges on the victim's machine are required prior to the exploit.
