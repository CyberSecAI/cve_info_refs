Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2230:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The content from `bugzilla.zimbra.com` explicitly mentions `CVE Number: CVE-2015-2230`. Therefore, the provided content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The root cause is a lack of proper encoding of HTML in the Zimbra admin console, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
- Reflected XSS: The admin console is vulnerable to multiple reflected XSS attacks due to insufficient HTML encoding of user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the admin console. This can lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to:
  - Session hijacking/cookie theft, enabling unauthorized access to the admin console.
  - Defacement of the admin console interface.
  - Redirecting administrators to malicious websites.
  - Performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim user, without their authorization.

**5. Attack Vectors**
- The attack vector is via crafted URLs or injected parameters within the admin console, which, when accessed, execute the malicious JavaScript. The vulnerable components include, but are not limited to, `ZaController.js` and `ZaSearchBubbleList.js`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
- The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs or parameters that target vulnerable parts of the admin console.
- The attacker must trick an authenticated admin user into clicking the malicious link. This requires some level of social engineering.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by encoding HTML in the vulnerable files to prevent the XSS attacks.
- The fix was implemented in  `ZaController.js` and `ZaSearchBubbleList.js`
- The fix was integrated into different branches, including JUDASPRIEST and JUDASPRIEST-860, indicating that the fix was applied to multiple versions of Zimbra.
- The bug was verified as fixed in versions 8.7.0_BETA1_1117 and 8.6.0_GA_1153, Patch 8.6.0_P2.

In summary, the provided content clearly describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Zimbra admin console caused by inadequate HTML encoding. The attacker can use malicious URLs to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a legitimate admin user, leading to potential security breaches. The vulnerability was addressed by implementing proper HTML encoding.
