Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2752:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping` hypercall in Xen does not implement preemption, allowing long-running operations without interruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of preemption in the `XEN_DOMCTL_memory_mapping` hypercall.
- Vulnerable code is in the hypervisor, which is used by the device model (qemu-dm) during PCI device passthrough to HVM guests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):**  A malicious HVM guest with a PCI passthrough device can cause a physical CPU core to become busy for an extended period. This can lead to a host-level DoS through excessive CPU consumption by the device model (qemu-dm). This can also lead to a denial of service for the domain running the device model, e.g., domain 0.
-  The issue can be triggered via legitimate operations from the guest, making it difficult to protect against.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Local:** Exploitable by local HVM guest users with a PCI passthrough device assigned to their VM.
-   The attack is triggered via the device model (qemu-dm).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over an HVM guest that has a PCI passthrough device assigned to it.
- The attacker must be able to initiate hypercalls related to memory mappings.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 3.2.x through 4.5.x.
- PV domains, HVM domains without passthrough devices, and ARM domains are not vulnerable.
- Running only PV guests can avoid this issue.
- Not assigning large MMIO devices to untrusted HVM guests is also a workaround.

- Patches are available for various Xen versions (4.5.x, 4.4.x, 4.3.x, 4.2.x).
- SUSE provided patches for various products including SLE, openSUSE, and SLES for SAP.
