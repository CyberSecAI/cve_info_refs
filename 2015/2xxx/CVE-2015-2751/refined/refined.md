{
  "CVE-2015-2751": {
    "Description": "Xen 4.3.x, 4.4.x, and 4.5.x, when using toolstack disaggregation, allows remote domains with partial management control to cause a denial of service (host lock) via unspecified domctl operations.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Xen handles certain domctl operations when toolstack disaggregation is enabled. These operations, when misused by a domain with partial management control, can lead to a host lockup.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Inadequate privilege management",
       "Lack of proper resource control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (host lock), potentially impacting all virtual machines running on the hypervisor. Security can be reduced in disaggregated systems.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote domains with partial management control. Specifically, exploitation involves misusing certain domctl operations.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to have partial management control over a domain."
