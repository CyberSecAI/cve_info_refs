Windows: Sandboxed Mount Reparse Point Creation Mitigation Bypass
Platform: Windows 10 (build 10240), earlier versions do not have the functionality
Class: Security Feature Bypass

Summary:
A mitigation added to Windows 10 to prevent NTFS Mount Reparse Points being created at integrity levels below medium can be bypassed.

Description:

Windows 10 has added some new mitigations to block the creation or change the behaviour of certain symbolic links when issued by a low integrity/sandboxed process. The presumed aim to to make it harder to abuse these types of tricks to break out of a sandbox.

In earlier builds on Windows 10 NTFS Mount Reparse Points were blocked outright from a sandboxed process, however in 10240 (what can only be assumed a final build) the check was moved to the kernel in IopXXXControlFile and changed slightly so that sandboxed processes could create some mount points. The check is roughly:

if (RtlIsSandboxedProcess()) {
   if(ControlCode == FSCTL_SET_MOUNT_POINT) {
       if (FsRtlValidateReparsePointBuffer(buffer) && buffer->ReparseTag == TAG_MOUNT_POINT) {
         NTSTATUS status = ZwOpenFile(..., buffer->ReparseTarget, FILE_GENERIC_WRITE, ... , FILE_DIRECTORY_FILE);
        if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
         return status;
       }
   }
}

The kernel is therefore checking that the target of the mount point is a directory and that the current process has write access to the directory. This would sufficiently limit the ability of a sandboxed process to abuse this to write files at a higher privilege. Unfortunately there’s a perhaps unexpected problem with this check, the sandboxed process can redirect the ZwOpenFile call arbitrarily to something it can open for write, yet the original value is set as the mount point. This is because the file open check is being made inside the process which is doing the call which means it honours the user’s device mapping.

While the sandboxed process cannot change the per-user drive mappings, it can change the process’s device map using NtSetInformationProcess with the ProcessDeviceMap information class. As we can create arbitrary object directories and symbolic links (which while they also have a mitigation it only prevents a higher privilege process following them, which we don’t care about) we can build a completely fake device map which redirects the open to another directory. A good target turns out to be \Device\NamedPipe\ (note the trailing slash) as that can be opened from any privilege level (including Chrome renderer processes) for write access and as a directory. So if we want to set an arbitrary mount point to say \??\c:\somewhere we can build something like:

<UNNAMED>(DIR) -> C:(DIR) -> somewhere(LINK to \Device\NamedPipe\)

If we set the unnamed directory to the process device map we can bypass the check and create the mount point.

Perhaps from a fix perspective you could query for the opened path and use that to write to the NTFS reparse point rather than using the original value.

Proof of Concept:

I’ve provided a PoC which will demonstrate the bypass. It should be executed at low integrity using psexec or modifying the executable file’s ACL to low. Ensure you use the correct version for the architecture on Windows, as there seems to be a bug in NtSetInformationProcess which blocks Wow64 apps from setting the process device map. You can compare the operation to the command shell’s mklink tool that will fail to create the mount point at low integrity. The archive password is ‘password’. Follow these steps:

1) Extract the PoC to a location on a local hard disk which is writable by a normal user.
2) Execute the poc executable file as low integrity passing two arguments, the path to a directory to create (must be somewhere than can be written to as low integrity user such as AppData\Temp\Low) and the arbitrary file path to set the mount point to. For example:
poc.exe c:\users\user\appdata\local\low\abc c:\notreal.

Expected Result:
It shouldn’t be possible to create a mount point pointed at a location not writable by low integrity user

Observed Result:
The mount point is created successfully.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
