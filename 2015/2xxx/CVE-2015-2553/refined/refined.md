Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper validation of junctions during the creation of mount points in Windows. Specifically, a mitigation introduced in Windows 10 to prevent low-integrity processes from creating NTFS mount reparse points was bypassed. The kernel checks if the target of a mount point is a directory and if the process has write access. However, a sandboxed process can redirect the ZwOpenFile call to a location it can write to, while the mount point is set to the original, unwriteable location. This bypasses the intended security check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient validation of mount point targets:** The kernel checks write access to the target of the mount point using `ZwOpenFile` which is being performed within the process's context. This allows for manipulation of the device map, redirecting the `ZwOpenFile` call to a different, writeable location.
*   **Bypass of Low-Integrity Mitigation:** The primary weakness is the ability of a low-integrity process to circumvent the intended protection against creating mount points to arbitrary locations.
*   **Abuse of Device Mapping:** The vulnerability leverages the ability to manipulate the process's device map using `NtSetInformationProcess` to redirect the open operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By successfully creating a mount point to an arbitrary location, an attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges and execute code within the security context of the user running the compromised application.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows a sandboxed process to break out of its restrictions.
*   **Arbitrary File System Access:** The attacker gains the ability to write files to locations that should be inaccessible to a low-integrity process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine and the ability to run code as a low-integrity process.
*   **Manipulated Device Mapping:** The attacker uses the ability to modify the process's device map to redirect file system calls.
*   **Mount Point Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of mount points using the `FSCTL_SET_MOUNT_POINT` control code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Integrity Process:** The attacker must be able to execute code as a low-integrity process. This can be done by running the malicious code in a sandbox, or by adjusting the security token of an existing process to run at low integrity.
*   **Ability to create arbitrary object directories and symbolic links:** The attacker needs to create fake directories and symbolic links to manipulate the device mapping.
*   **Knowledge of Device Mapping Mechanisms:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate device maps to redirect the file open operation.
*   **Exploitation of NtSetInformationProcess:** The attacker must be able to utilize the `NtSetInformationProcess` system call with the `ProcessDeviceMap` information class.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit specifically targets the `IopXXXControlFile` function within the Windows kernel.
*   The vulnerability affects Windows 10, specifically build 10240, where the mitigation was introduced. The vulnerability also applies to other Windows versions as per the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-111.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available, demonstrating the bypass. The PoC highlights the use of a device map to redirect the `ZwOpenFile` call to a directory like `\Device\NamedPipe\` which is writeable by sandboxed processes, and using this to create the mount point.
*   The Microsoft advisory suggests a potential fix of querying the opened path and using that rather than the original value to write to the NTFS reparse point
