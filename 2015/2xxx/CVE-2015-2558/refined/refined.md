Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office Excel parses the `fileVersion` element within a workbook.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** By providing an overly long value for the `fileVersion` element, an attacker can trigger a use-after-free condition. This means a program tries to access memory that has already been released or deallocated, leading to a crash or exploitable state.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability stems from memory corruption within how Microsoft Office handles objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could run arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves the user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office Excel file.
- **Email Attack:** An attacker could send a malicious Excel file via email, enticing the user to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious Excel file on a website (or leverage a compromised site), encouraging users to download and open the file, or open it directly through the web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft Malicious File:** Attackers must be able to create a specially crafted Microsoft Excel file with an overly long `fileVersion` value.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening the malicious file through email or web browsing.
