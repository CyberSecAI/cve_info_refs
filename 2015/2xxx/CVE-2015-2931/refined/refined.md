Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2931:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete blacklist of disallowed MIME types for data URIs within SVG files. Specifically, the `application/xml` MIME type was not included in the blacklist, which allowed attackers to embed malicious SVG content with Javascript code within a `data:` URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Blacklist:** The primary weakness is the use of a blacklist approach for filtering MIME types instead of a whitelist. The blacklist failed to account for all potentially dangerous MIME types.
- **Embedded SVG:** The ability to embed a malicious SVG with Javascript via the `data:` URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the SVG file, leading to XSS attacks when a user views the file. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Uploaded SVG files:** A malicious user uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing the malicious Javascript code embedded within a data: URI, taking advantage of the incomplete blacklist.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload SVG files to the MediaWiki instance. This typically requires user privileges or a vulnerability in the upload process itself.
- **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker needs to know that the application/xml MIME type is not blacklisted in the filtering of data URIs.
- **Crafting of Malicious SVG:**  The attacker needs to create an SVG file with a nested SVG and Javascript via data URI.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified by iSEC Partners and Mario Heiderich/Cure53.
- The fix involved switching from a blacklist to a whitelist approach for data URIs.
- The vulnerability was present in MediaWiki versions 1.19.x, 1.23.x, and 1.24.x.
- The vulnerability was confirmed to be exploitable in Firefox.
- The fix involved a change in the `includes/upload/UploadBase.php` file where the validation of href attributes within SVG files is performed, moving to a whitelist approach for accepted data URIs.
