Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=386&can=1

We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing corrupted OTF font files, such as:

---
DRIVER_PAGE_FAULT_IN_FREED_SPECIAL_POOL (d5)
Memory was referenced after it was freed.
This cannot be protected by try-except.
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: fc937cdf, memory referenced
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
Arg3: 91d75195, if non-zero, the address which referenced memory.

The bugcheck is caused by an attempt to read memory from an unmapped address. The specific expression being dereferenced by ATMFD.DLL is "base address of the Name INDEX data + NAME.offset[x] - 1", however no bounds checking is performed over the value of NAME.offset[x] before using it for pointer arithmetic. To our current knowledge, this condition can only lead to an out-of-bounds read, thus limiting the impact of the bug to remote denial of service, or potentially local kernel memory disclosure. However, we have not fully confirmed that the severity of the bug is not in fact more significant due to some further ATMFD logic we are not aware of.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1. It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for ATMFD.DLL (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it should also be possible to observe a crash on a default Windows installation in ATMFD.DLL.

Attached is an archive with three proof of concept font files together with corresponding kernel crash logs.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Graphics Component Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3078662)

Published: August 11, 2015 | Updated: October 7, 2015

**Version:** 2.2

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Lync, and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded TrueType or OpenType fonts.

This security update is rated Critical for supported releases of Microsoft Windows and all affected editions of Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Lync, and Microsoft Silverlight. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* The Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts
* The Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType fonts.
* Office handles OGL fonts
* The Windows kernel handles memory addresses
* User processes are terminated upon logoff
* Windows validates impersonation levels
* The Windows shell validates impersonation levels

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3078662](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3078662).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

The severity ratings indicated for each affected software assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletinâs release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [August bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-aug).

## Update FAQ

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems. If multiple updates apply, they can be installed in any order.

**How do I determine which version of Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912).

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**I am running Office 2010, which is listed as affected software. Why am I not being offered the 3054846 update?**

The 3054846 update is not applicable to Office 2010 on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows because the vulnerable code is not present.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335). For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

**Are there any prerequisites for any of the updates offered in this bulletin for affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business)?**

Yes. Customers running affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) must first install the 2965218 update for Office 2013 released in April, 2015, and then the 3039779 security update released in May, 2015. For more information about these two prerequisite updates, see:

* [https:](https://)
* [Knowledge Base Article 3039779](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3039779)

**Are there any related non-security updates that customers should install along with the Microsoft Live Meeting Console security update?**

Yes, in addition to releasing a security update for Microsoft Live Meeting Console, Microsoft has released the following non-security updates for the OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook. Where applicable, Microsoft recommends that customers install these updates to keep their systems up-to-date:

* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (32-bit) (3079743)
* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (64-bit) (3079743)

See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3079743](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3079743) for more information.

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

**Which web browsers support Microsoft Silverlight applications?**

To be able to run Microsoft Silverlight applications, most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, require Microsoft Silverlight to be installed and the corresponding plug-in to be enabled. For more information about Microsoft Silverlight, see the official site, [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). Please refer to the documentation of your browser to learn more about how to disable or remove plug-ins.

**What versions of Microsoft Silverlight 5 are affected by the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Silverlight build 5.1.40728, which was the current build of Microsoft Silverlight as of when this bulletin was first released, addresses the vulnerability and is not affected. Builds of Microsoft Silverlight previous to 5.1.40728 are affected.

**How do I know which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on my system?**

If Microsoft Silverlight is already installed on your computer, you can visit the [Get Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight) page, which will indicate which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Manage Add-Ons feature of current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the version and build information that is currently installed on your system.

You can also manually check the version number of sllauncher.exe located in the â%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Silverlightâ directory (on x86 Microsoft Windows systems) or in the â%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Silverlightâ directory (on x64 Microsoft Windows systems).

In addition, on Microsoft Windows, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found in the registry at [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x86 Microsoft Windows systems, or [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x64 Microsoft Windows systems.

On Apple Mac OS, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found as follows:

1. Open the **Finder**
2. Select the system drive and go to the folder **Internet Plug-ins - Library**
3. Right-click the file **Silverlight.Plugin** (if your mouse has only one button, press the **Ctrl** key while clicking on the file) to bring up the context menu, then click **Show Package Contents**
4. Inside the contents folder, locate the file **info.plist** and open it with an editor. It will contain an entry like this, which shows you the version number:

   SilverlightVersion

   5.1.40728

The version installed with this security update for Microsoft Silverlight 5 is 5.1.40728. If your Microsoft Silverlight 5 version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Rename ATMFD.DLL**

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (disable ATMFD):**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
  2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key (or create it) and set its DWORD value to 1:

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 1
  3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

  **Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

  1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
     "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run **regedit.exe**.
  3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

     (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
  5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will not display properly. Disabling ATMFD.DLL could cause certain applications to stop working properly if they use OpenType fonts. Microsoft Windows does not release any OpenType fonts natively. However, third-party applications could install them and they could be affected by this change.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (enable ATMFD):**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
  2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key and set its DWORD value to 0:

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 0
  3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

  **Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

  1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

     `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

     `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]`

     `"DisableATMFD"=dword:00000000`

     2. Run **regedit.exe**.
  2. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  3. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

     (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
  4. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

## Multiple TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when components of Windows, .NET Framework, Office, Lync, and Silverlight fail to properly handle TrueType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities, including by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or by convincing them to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded TrueType fonts.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType fonts.

## Windows CSRSS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2453

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) terminates a process when a user logs off. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code that is designed to monitor the actions of a user who subsequently logs on to the system. This could allow the disclosure of sensitive information or access to data on the affected systems that was accessible to the logged-on user. This sensitive data could include the logon credentials of subsequent users, which an attacker might later use to elevate privilege or to execute code as a different user on the system. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly. It could be used to collect useful information to try to further compromise the affected system. If a user with administrative privileges subsequently logs on to the system, the attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full system rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application that is designed to continue running after the attacker logs off. When a new user logs on with their own credentials, the attacker's process could monitor all actions performed by the newly logged-on user. If the newly logged-on user is an administrator, the information disclosed could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

Systems where multiple users have permissions to log on locally and run untrusted applications are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how user processes are terminated upon logoff. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
