{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver when processing a malformed Name INDEX in the CFF table of an OTF font file. Specifically, the driver attempts to read memory using the expression 'base address of the Name INDEX data + NAME.offset[x] - 1' without validating NAME.offset[x].",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a crash when the driver attempts to access unmapped memory. It may potentially lead to local kernel memory disclosure. The severity of the bug may be more significant due to further ATMFD logic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted document containing the malicious font.",
      "Visiting a webpage with embedded malformed OTF font."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed OTF font file and then either convince a user to open a document with the font or visit a website that uses it. No special privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability."
