# USN-2564-1: Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) vulnerabilities

9 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's scsi

subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4036](/security/CVE-2015-4036))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

net: rds: use correct size for max unacked packets and bytes

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/db27ebb111e9f69efece08e4cb6a34ff980f8896)

```
Max unacked packets/bytes is an int while sizeof(long) was used in the
sysctl table.

This means that when they were getting read we'd also leak kernel memory
to userspace along with the timeout values.

An update that solves 18 vulnerabilities and has 25 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 LTSS kernel was updated to receive
various security and bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2015-5707: An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver could be
potentially used by local attackers to crash the kernel or execute code.
- CVE-2015-2830: arch/x86/kernel/entry\_64.S in the Linux kernel did not
prevent the TS\_COMPAT flag from reaching a user-mode task, which might
have allowed local users to bypass the seccomp or audit protection
mechanism via a crafted application that uses the (1) fork or (2) close
system call, as demonstrated by an attack against seccomp before 3.16
(bnc#926240).
- CVE-2015-0777: drivers/xen/usbback/usbback.c in the Linux kernel allowed
guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
locations in host OS kernel memory via unspecified vectors (bnc#917830).
- CVE-2015-2150: Xen and the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access
to PCI command registers, which might have allowed local guest users to
cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by
disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device
and then accessing the device, which triggers an Unsupported Request
(UR) response (bnc#919463).
- CVE-2015-5364: A remote denial of service (hang) via UDP flood with
incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-5366: A remote denial of service (unexpected error returns) via
UDP flood with incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-1420: CVE-2015-1420: Race condition in the handle\_to\_path
function in fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
bypass intended size restrictions and trigger read operations on
additional memory locations by changing the handle\_bytes value of a file
handle during the execution of this function (bnc#915517).
- CVE-2015-4700: A local user could have created a bad instruction in the
JIT processed BPF code, leading to a kernel crash (bnc#935705).
- CVE-2015-1805: The (1) pipe\_read and (2) pipe\_write implementations in
fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel did not properly consider the side effects
of failed \_\_copy\_to\_user\_inatomic and \_\_copy\_from\_user\_inatomic calls,
which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application, aka an "I/O
vector array overrun" (bnc#933429).
- CVE-2015-3331: The \_\_driver\_rfc4106\_decrypt function in
arch/x86/crypto/aesni-intel\_glue.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
determine the memory locations used for encrypted data, which allowed
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer
overflow and system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by
triggering a crypto API call, as demonstrated by use of a libkcapi test
program with an AF\_ALG(aead) socket (bnc#927257).
- CVE-2015-2922: The ndisc\_router\_discovery function in net/ipv6/ndisc.c
in the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to reconfigure a hop-limit
setting via a small hop\_limit value in a Router Advertisement (RA)
message (bnc#922583).
- CVE-2015-2041: net/llc/sysctl\_net\_llc.c in the Linux kernel used an
incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly
have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry (bnc#919007).
- CVE-2015-3636: The ping\_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux
kernel did not initialize a certain list data structure during an unhash
operation, which allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by leveraging the
ability to make a SOCK\_DGRAM socket system call for the IPPROTO\_ICMP or
IPPROTO\_ICMPV6 protocol, and then making a connect system call after a
disconnect (bnc#929525).
- CVE-2014-8086: Race condition in the ext4\_file\_write\_iter function in
fs/ext4/file.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service (file unavailability) via a combination of a write action and
an F\_SETFL fcntl operation for the O\_DIRECT flag (bnc#900881).
- CVE-2014-8159: The InfiniBand (IB) implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly restrict use of User Verbs for registration of memory
regions, which allowed local users to access arbitrary physical memory
locations, and consequently cause a denial of service (system crash)
or gain privileges, by leveraging permissions on a uverbs device under
/dev/infiniband/ (bnc#914742).
- CVE-2014-9683: Off-by-one error in the ecryptfs\_decode\_from\_filename
function in fs/ecryptfs/crypto.c in the eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux
kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow
and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted filename
(bnc#918333).
- CVE-2015-2042: net/rds/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel used an incorrect
data type in a sysctl table, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly have
unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry (bnc#919018).
- CVE-2015-1421: Use-after-free vulnerability in the sctp\_assoc\_update
function in net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (slab corruption and panic) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering an INIT collision
that leads to improper handling of shared-key data (bnc#915577).

# USN-2561-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

8 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not

properly sanitize its input parameters while registering memory regions

from userspace. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or to potentially gain administrative privileges.

([CVE-2014-8159](/security/CVE-2014-8159))

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1462-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1462.82](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1462.82)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Debian Bug     : 741667 782515 782561 782698

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2014-8159

    It was found that the Linux kernel's InfiniBand/RDMA subsystem did
    not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory
    regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with
    access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to
    crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
    system.

CVE-2014-9715

    It was found that the netfilter connection tracking subsystem used
    too small a type as an offset within each connection's data
    structure, following a bug fix in Linux 3.2.33 and 3.6.  In some
    configurations, this would lead to memory corruption and crashes
    (even without malicious traffic).  This could potentially also
    result in violation of the netfilter policy or remote code
    execution.

    This can be mitigated by disabling connection tracking accounting:
        sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=0

CVE-2015-2041

    Sasha Levin discovered that the LLC subsystem exposed some variables
    as sysctls with the wrong type.  On a 64-bit kernel, this possibly
    allows privilege escalation from a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability; it also results in a trivial information leak.

CVE-2015-2042

    Sasha Levin discovered that the RDS subsystem exposed some variables
    as sysctls with the wrong type.  On a 64-bit kernel, this results in
    a trivial information leak.

CVE-2015-2150

    Jan Beulich discovered that Xen guests are currently permitted to
    modify all of the (writable) bits in the PCI command register of
    devices passed through to them.  This in particular allows them to
    disable memory and I/O decoding on the device unless the device is
    an SR-IOV virtual function, which can result in denial of service
    to the host.

CVE-2015-2830

    Andrew Lutomirski discovered that when a 64-bit task on an amd64
    kernel makes a fork(2) or clone(2) system call using int $0x80, the
    32-bit compatibility flag is set (correctly) but is not cleared on
    return.  As a result, both seccomp and audit will misinterpret the
    following system call by the task(s), possibly leading to a
    violation of security policy.

CVE-2015-2922

    Modio AB discovered that the IPv6 subsystem would process a router
    advertisement that specifies no route but only a hop limit, which
    would then be applied to the interface that received it.  This can
    result in loss of IPv6 connectivity beyond the local network.

    This may be mitigated by disabling processing of IPv6 router
    advertisements if they are not needed:
        sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0
        sysctl net.ipv6.conf.<interface>.accept_ra=0

CVE-2015-3331

    Stephan Mueller discovered that the optimised implementation of
    RFC4106 GCM for x86 processors that support AESNI miscalculated
    buffer addresses in some cases.  If an IPsec tunnel is configured to
    use this mode (also known as AES-GCM-ESP) this can lead to memory
    corruption and crashes (even without malicious traffic).  This could
    potentially also result in remote code execution.

CVE-2015-3332

    Ben Hutchings discovered that the TCP Fast Open feature regressed
    in Linux 3.16.7-ckt9, resulting in a kernel BUG when it is used.
    This can be used as a local denial of service.

CVE-2015-3339

    It was found that the execve(2) system call can race with inode
    attribute changes made by chown(2).  Although chown(2) clears the
    setuid/setgid bits of a file if it changes the respective owner ID,
    this race condition could result in execve(2) setting effective
    uid/gid to the new owner ID, a privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u1. The linux package in wheezy is not affected
by CVE-2015-3332.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt9-3~deb8u1 or earlier versions. Additionally, this
version fixes a regression in the xen-netfront driver (#782698).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt9-3 or earlier versions.  Additionally, this version
fixes a regression in the xen-netfront driver (#782698).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# CVE-2015-2042

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-2041.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2044.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2042 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2042)

#### Description

net/rds/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19 uses an incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

[CVSS v2 Scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm)
|  | National Vulnerability Database |
| Base Score | 4.6 |

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [919018](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919018) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP

(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

([CVE-2015-1421](/security/CVE-2015-1421))

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets

to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker on the same subnet can exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-1465](/security/CVE-2015-1465))

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

  -
  [3.13.0-49.81](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-49.81)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [926240](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=926240) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x and the Linux kernel through 3.19.1 do not properly restrict access to PCI command registers, which might allow local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device and then accessing the device, which triggers an Unsupported Request (UR) response.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [800280](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=800280) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [919463](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919463) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# USN-2560-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

8 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of

the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this

flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection

mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](/security/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of

userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could

exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](/security/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting

the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit

this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](/security/CVE-2015-2042))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

  -
  [3.2.0-80.116](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-80.116)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE-2015-1805

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1804.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1815.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1805 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1805)

#### Description

The (1) pipe\_read and (2) pipe\_write implementations in fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16 do not properly consider the side effects of failed \_\_copy\_to\_user\_inatomic and \_\_copy\_from\_user\_inatomic calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application, aka an "I/O vector array overrun."

# CVE-2015-2041

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1931.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2042.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2041 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2041)

#### Description

net/llc/sysctl\_net\_llc.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19 uses an incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [919007](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919007) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1195355#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-02-23 16:09:16 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the method that the linux kernel handles userspace tuning of the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) system settings. The incorrect handling allowed a trusted user to set multiple RDS sysctls for RDS with specially formatted data.  Reading from these files also returned data from other sysctl settings that would be exposed via the same permissions to this user.  This bug provides little risk to users as the values that can be modified are exposed via proc sysctls with the same permissions.  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=db27ebb111e9f69efece08e4cb6a34ff980f8896>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1195355#c2)  Wade Mealing    2015-03-04 06:36:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of the kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 . Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1195355#c3)  Wade Mealing    2015-03-06 03:44:53 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1199365](show_bug.cgi?id=1199365 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-2042 kernel: rds: information handling flaw in rds sysctl files.
