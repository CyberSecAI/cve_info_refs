### Relevant Content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) subsystem used an incorrect data type in a sysctl table. Specifically, the `maxlen` parameter for `rds_sysctl_max_unacked_packets` and `rds_sysctl_max_unacked_bytes` sysctl entries was incorrectly set to `sizeof(unsigned long)` instead of `sizeof(int)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The incorrect `maxlen` value led to the leakage of kernel memory to userspace when the sysctl entries were read.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** A local user could potentially read data from other sysctl settings, as the size mismatch allowed for reading beyond the intended boundaries.  The data that could be leaked might include sensitive kernel information.
*   **Unspecified impact**: The incorrect data type could have unspecified other impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local user access through the sysctl interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   A local user with the ability to access sysctl entries.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in `net/rds/sysctl.c` in the Linux kernel.
* The fix involves changing the `maxlen` of the `rds_sysctl_max_unacked_packets` and `rds_sysctl_max_unacked_bytes` sysctl entries from `sizeof(unsigned long)` to `sizeof(int)`.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in the Linux Kernel before version 3.19.
* Several distributions including Ubuntu, Debian and SUSE were affected by this vulnerability.
* Patches were issued by the affected distributions to fix this flaw by updating to the corrected kernel versions.
