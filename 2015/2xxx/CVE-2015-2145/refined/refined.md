Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2145:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a fix for multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues discovered by the vendor of phpBugTracker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple Stored/Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially compromising other users' accounts, including administrator accounts. As noted in the email, if an admin enters XSS intentionally, it can compromise other admin accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the phpBugTracker application, where the vendor introduced a fix for multiple XSS vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application (i.e. gain access to an administrative account)

**Additional Notes:**
- The email discussion highlights a point that an XSS vulnerability between equivalent admin accounts might not typically be considered a CVE unless the vendor acknowledges it as a violation of security policy and provides a fix.
- This CVE is specifically for the XSS vulnerabilities found and fixed by the vendor, not those discovered by external researchers.
