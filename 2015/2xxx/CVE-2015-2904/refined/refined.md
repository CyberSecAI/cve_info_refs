**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Actiontec GT784WN Wireless N DSL Modem contains hard-coded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259): The modem has hard-coded usernames and passwords that allow an attacker to log into the web administration interface with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain complete control of the affected device.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.
- The attacker can perform actions as an authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can use the hardcoded credentials to log in through the web administration interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the device through a network
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated

**Additional notes**
- The document also mentions another vulnerability, CVE-2015-2905, which is a CSRF vulnerability. This vulnerability can be combined with the hard-coded credentials to reliably establish an active session as part of an attack, even without a user logged in
- The vendor provided a firmware update to resolve these issues.
