{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "Unsanitized input in the `catId` parameter of the `/cm/blogrss/feed` servlet allows for SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Time-based SQL injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cm/blogrss/feed` servlet, specifically targeting the `catId` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, but does not require any authentication or specific position on the network."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure implementation of file export functionality via `/cm/newui/blog/export.jsp` that allows traversal using the `filepath` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file read vulnerability",
       "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the web server's installation directory. This can be leveraged to retrieve sensitive information such as database credentials stored in the `cm.xml` file.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `/cm/newui/blog/export.jsp` with a manipulated `filepath` parameter.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have a valid session. However, creating a new user on the system is simple."
