{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not explicitly set a flag to deny connections from hosts other than localhost when calling the Fiddler.FiddlerApplication.Startup() method.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application unintentionally operates as an open proxy due to the lack of explicit configuration to restrict incoming connections.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote third party could use the vulnerable application as a proxy server, potentially misusing it as a stepping stone for attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The application listens on TCP port 37564, which can be exploited by remote attackers if the application is not configured correctly to deny external connections.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the machine running the vulnerable software on port 37564."
