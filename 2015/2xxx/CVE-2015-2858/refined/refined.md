Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in the Datalex airline booking software's error handling routines. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle null values when querying data from the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:** The application allows modification of HTTP POST parameters, which can be manipulated to cause the application to return null values. This leads to a failed state, allowing an attacker to bypass authorization.
- **Inadequate Error Handling:** The application's error handling is insufficient, leading to a bypass when null values are encountered instead of proper error reporting/handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of Confidentiality:**  An attacker could gain access to all user data due to the authorization bypass.
- **Data Modification:**  Unauthenticated remote users could modify arbitrary user data.
- **Account Hijacking:** By modifying the `profileId` parameter, an attacker can hijack an account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP POST parameters to cause the application to return null values during database queries.
- Specifically, manipulating parameters in `ValidateFormAction.do` and `ProfileConfirmEditAddressAction.do`  can cause a bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with modified parameters.

The provided information includes a CVSS score:
- **Base Score:** 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N) indicating a high severity vulnerability with network attack vector, low attack complexity, no authentication, complete confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and no availability impact.
- **Temporal Score:** 6.4 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
- **Environmental Score:** 6.4 (CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

The vulnerability has been addressed by Datalex, and affected airlines have deployed the update.
