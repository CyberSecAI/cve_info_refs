Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided documents related to CVE-2015-2806:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `asn1_der_decoding` function of the libtasn1 library. This occurs when the library processes certain specially crafted DER-encoded data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. This means that by providing specific input, an attacker can write data past the boundary of a buffer located on the stack, overwriting other data or even potentially executing arbitrary code.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The root cause is the library's failure to correctly handle and validate the structure of DER-encoded data during decoding, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact is a crash of applications using the vulnerable `libtasn1` library. This can lead to a denial of service as the application becomes unusable.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Although not explicitly stated as highly likely, the overflow could theoretically be exploited to execute arbitrary code, potentially giving an attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by providing maliciously crafted DER-encoded data to an application that uses the vulnerable `libtasn1` library.
*   **Malicious ASN.1 Objects:** Specifically, the vulnerability occurs while the library decodes ASN.1 objects using the DER encoding method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to send or provide specifically crafted ASN.1 data to an application that uses the vulnerable libtasn1 library. This may involve the attacker having access to the service which makes use of the library.
*   **No Authentication Required**: Many sources state that the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Function:** The vulnerable function is `asn1_der_decoding`, specifically the `_asn1_ltostr` part of the function
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in libtasn1 version 4.4 (or newer) by introducing `LTOSTR_MAX_SIZE` and enforcing bounds checking.
*   **Affected Software:** Libraries like GnuTLS and GNU Shishi use libtasn1 and are affected by this flaw.
*   **Severity:** Red Hat rated this as a "Moderate" security impact, whereas Gentoo classified it as "normal" severity. The CVSS score is not explicitly mentioned, but a "medium" risk was assigned by Red Hat.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to a patched version of libtasn1 is the recommended solution. Patches were also created for older versions of libtasn1.
*   **Reproducer:** A malformed certificate exposing the heap overflow has been identified.
*   **CVE Assignment:** The CVE ID CVE-2015-2806 was assigned for this vulnerability on March 30, 2015.
