Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2661:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability within the client component of Oracle MySQL Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies within the client component of the MySQL server, where a local user could exploit it to cause a partial denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could result in a local user causing a partial denial-of-service (DoS) affecting the MySQL server. The impact is limited to availability, with no mention of confidentiality or integrity compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local; meaning an attacker would need local access to the machine running a vulnerable version of the mysql client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have local access to the system in order to trigger this vulnerability. Authenticated access to the MySQL server is not required.

**Additional notes:**
- Red Hat's analysis of CVE-2015-2661 indicates the attack vector is local and does not require any authentication and it impacts availability only.
- Oracle's advisory indicates it only affects the client side and is triggered by local users, impacting availability.
- SUSE's analysis indicates that the access vector is local and no authentication is required, and impacts availability.
- Gentoo's analysis mentions that the CVE could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information, however, the specific CVE (CVE-2015-2661) is documented as a local vulnerability by other sources.

In summary, the vulnerability in CVE-2015-2661 allows for a local user to potentially cause a partial denial of service on the MySQL server, by exploiting an unspecified issue in the MySQL client. It is not remotely exploitable, and does not grant access to sensitive data.
