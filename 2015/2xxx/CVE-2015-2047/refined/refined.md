Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `rsaauth` extension of TYPO3 CMS. The authentication process can be bypassed because the password is cast to an empty value during the frontend authentication process when `rsaauth` is configured for frontend usage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication Bypass: Frontend users can be authenticated by knowing only their username due to the password being cast to an empty value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to restricted frontend areas of the TYPO3 CMS by bypassing the authentication mechanism. This allows them to impersonate legitimate users.
- Partial Integrity Impact: While not explicitly stated, gaining unauthorized access could lead to potential data manipulation, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Frontend Login: The attack targets the frontend user login functionality of the TYPO3 CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to know a valid username of a TYPO3 frontend user.
-  The attacker does not need to know the user's password, as it is bypassed by this vulnerability.
- The TYPO3 instance must have the `rsaauth` extension loaded and configured for frontend usage, with `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['loginSecurityLevel'] = 'rsa'`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions 4.3.0 to 4.3.14, 4.4.0 to 4.4.15, 4.5.0 to 4.5.39, and 4.6.0 to 4.6.18, when rsaauth is enabled for the frontend.
- The severity of the vulnerability was initially considered critical but was later adjusted to high.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TYPO3 version 4.5.40.
- A patch and a diff file are also available for manual patching.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Pierrick Caillon, and a fix was developed by Nicole Cordes.
- The CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N, with a base score of 2.6(SUSE) and 4.3(NVD).
