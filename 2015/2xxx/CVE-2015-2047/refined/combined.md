# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2015-001: Authentication Bypass in TYPO3 CMS 4.5

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Helmut Hummel

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS 4.5.x is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass.

**Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS

**Vulnerability Types:** Authentication Bypass

**Overall Severity:** High

**Release Date:** February 19, 2015

**Vulnerable subcomponent:** RSA Authentication (ext:rsaauth)

**Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Bypass

**Affected Versions:** Versions 4.3.0 to 4.3.14, 4.4.0 to 4.4.15, 4.5.0 to 4.5.39 and 4.6.0 to 4.6.18

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator?vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C))

**CVE:**  [CVE-2015-2047](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-2047)

**Problem Description:** It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. Frontend users can be authenticated by only knowing their username.

TYPO3 installations are **affected,** if **all** of the following applies:

* TYPO3 Version 4.3.0 to 4.3.14, 4.4.0 to 4.4.15, 4.5.0 to 4.5.39 or 4.6.0 to 4.6.18
* users/access restricted frontend area (frontend login)
* system extension *rsaauth* is **loaded**
* system extension *rsaauth* is **configured** for frontend usage like that:
  ```
     $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['loginSecurityLevel'] = 'rsa'
  ```

TYPO3 installations are **not affected,** if **at least one** of the following applies:

* TYPO3 Version 4.7.0 or higher
* **no** users/access restricted frontend area (TYPO3 Backend authentication is not affected)
* system extension *rsaauth* is **not loaded** (default)
* system extension *rsaauth* is **not configured** for frontend usage like that (default):
  ```
     $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['loginSecurityLevel'] = 'rsa'
  ```

**Solution:** Update to TYPO3 version 4.5.40 that fixes the problem described. Alternatively use the provided <media 2938>shell script</media> to patch all affected TYPO3 versions (all between 4.3 and 4.6) that are found in a specified directory or use the [diff file](https://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git/commitdiff_plain/3fbd91c58baf98bdd8988333d90294cc6dc8f0c7) to patch the installations manually.

**Important Note:** Updating or patching your installations to fix this **CRITICAL** vulnerability is **STRONGLY ADVISED!**

**Credits:** Thanks to Pierrick Caillon who discovered and reported the vulnerability and to Security Team Member Nicole Cordes for developing a fix and providing the shell script.

**General Advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Opens external link in new window"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

**General Note:** All security related code changes are tagged so that you can easily look them up on our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).
