## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3060716)

Published: August 11, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application or convinces a user to open a specially crafted file that invokes a vulnerable sandboxed application, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Windows 10, which is not affected. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Object Manager handles object symbolic links created by a sandbox process, by preventing improper interaction with the registry by sandboxed applications, and by preventing improper interaction with the filesystem by sandboxed applications. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3060716](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3060716).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Object Manager Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2428

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows Object Manager when it fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass impersonation-level security and gain elevated privileges on a targeted system.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, an attacker could use this vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability to effect arbitrary code execution. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Object Manager handles object symbolic links created by a sandbox process.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Windows Registry Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2429

An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft Windows when it improperly allows certain registry interactions from within vulnerable sandboxed applications. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could improperly interact with the registry and attempt to escape the application sandbox.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince the user to open a specially crafted file that would invoke a vulnerable sandboxed application, resulting in a compromise of the sandbox. The attacker could then run programs with the privileges of the logged on user. The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing improper interaction with the registry by sandboxed applications.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Windows Filesystem Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2430

An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft Windows when it improperly allows certain filesystem interactions from within vulnerable sandboxed applications. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could improperly interact with the filesystem and attempt to escape the application sandbox.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince the user to open a specially crafted file that would invoke a vulnerable sandboxed application, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox. The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing improper interaction with the filesystem by sandboxed applications.
