    "summary": "The provided content describes a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler VPX help pages. The vulnerability occurs because the value of the `searchQuery` URL parameter is directly assigned to the `innerHTML` property of a DOM element. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL that injects arbitrary client-side script, leading to the potential for session token theft, arbitrary actions and keystroke logging. The vulnerability is found in Citrix NetScaler VPX version NSVPX-ESX-10.5-50.10 and fixed in NetScaler 10.5 build 52.8nc."
