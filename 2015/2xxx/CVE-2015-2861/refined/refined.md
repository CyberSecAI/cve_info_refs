Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing or insufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in Vesta Control Panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (CWE-352):** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform actions within the Vesta Control Panel with the same privileges as a logged-in victim user. This means an attacker can potentially modify the system configuration, create or delete users, alter DNS records, add firewall rules, etc., all without the user's consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious request (e.g., using a crafted link, form, or JavaScript) that targets a vulnerable function in Vesta Control Panel.
- The attacker relies on a victim user being logged into Vesta Control Panel and tricked into triggering the malicious request (e.g. by clicking a link or visiting a malicious website).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick or induce an authenticated user to interact with the malicious request crafted by the attacker.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The provided GitHub commit shows many changes across different files of Vesta Control Panel.  The changes made in each of the files includes a common fix for the CSRF vulnerability, by adding a token check before processing a POST request. The specific code added to all the files was a check for a token, and redirecting the request if this check fails:
```php
    // Check token
    if ((!isset($_POST['token'])) || ($_SESSION['token'] != $_POST['token'])) {
        header('location: /login/');
        exit();
    }
```
- Vesta Control Panel version 0.9.8-14 addresses this issue, according to the CERT advisory.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ben Khlifa Fahmi and Ben Mn√© Tarek.
- The CVSS score indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
