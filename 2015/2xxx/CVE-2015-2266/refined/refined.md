Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when handling URLs related to user messaging in Moodle. By modifying the URL, a logged-in user could access information intended for another user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The system didn't properly validate the user's permission to access the target user's data, allowing access by simply altering the user ID in the URL.
- **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows one user to view another user's personal contacts, the number of unread messages, and their enrolled courses, which is a breach of privacy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** A logged-in user can gain access to sensitive information of other users, such as their contact lists, unread message counts, and course enrollments.
- **Privacy Violation:** This allows an attacker to learn about the activities and connections of another user, which may compromise their privacy within the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves modifying the URL within the Moodle application to access another user's messaging-related information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user within the Moodle system.
- **Knowledge of URL Structure:**  The attacker needs to be aware of the structure of the URL that allows them to access this information and how to modify it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is classified as "Minor" severity.
-  The fix involves a check to ensure the current user is authorized to view the requested information, as indicated in the commit message "MDL-49204 core_message: Checking current user".
- A workaround is available by disabling messaging on the Moodle site.
- Affected Moodle versions are 2.8 to 2.8.3, 2.7 to 2.7.5, 2.6 to 2.6.8 and earlier unsupported versions
- Versions fixed are 2.8.4, 2.7.6 and 2.6.9
