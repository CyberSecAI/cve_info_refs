Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Navis DocumentCloud WordPress plugin contained a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `js/window.php` file.
- The plugin directly appends the `wpbase` GET parameter to the `$SITEURL` variable without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The unsanitized user-supplied input is reflected back to the user's browser within the HTML context.
- The vulnerability exists in `js/window.php` where `$SITEURL .= $_GET['wpbase'];` directly uses the unsanitized input in a script tag.
- This is a client side vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
- This could result in various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted URL.
- **GET parameter:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `wpbase` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** An attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL and trick a user into visiting it
- The plugin does not need to be active for the vulnerability to be exploited

**Additional details:**
- The plugin was closed due to the vulnerability and guideline violations
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.1.1, however, the plugin is no longer maintained, so users are encouraged to switch to the DocumentCloud plugin
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 (Medium), with the vector string being AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N
- The proof of concept URL is: `http://yourwordpresssite/wp-content/plugins/navis-documentcloud/js/window.php?wpbase=%22%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22`
