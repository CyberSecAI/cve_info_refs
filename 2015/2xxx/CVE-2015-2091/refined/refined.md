Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2091:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `mod_gnutls` module for Apache HTTP Server. Specifically, the authentication hook (`mgs_hook_authz`) did not properly enforce client certificate verification, even when the "GnuTLSClientVerify" option was set to "require". This means the module was not checking if the client certificates were valid before granting access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Client Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the failure to validate client certificates despite the configuration requiring it.
*   **Ignoring Server's Client Verify Mode:** The authentication hook was not considering the server's client verify mode, leading to the acceptance of invalid certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Client Spoofing:** A remote attacker could present a crafted, invalid certificate and gain access to the server, effectively spoofing a legitimate client.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  The attacker can bypass client authentication requirements, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker does not need to be on the local network.
*   **Crafted Certificates:** The attacker needs to generate or obtain a crafted certificate that the module should reject but does not.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   **Certificate Creation:** The attacker must be able to create or obtain a certificate that would be considered invalid by a proper verification process.
*   **No prior authentication is needed**: This vulnerability allows access even when client certificates should be enforced.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Debian bug report provides more technical detail, including the specific code location of the error and a patch to resolve it.
*   The issue was present in multiple versions of the `mod_gnutls` module.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring the authentication hook properly checks the server's client verify mode even if not set for specific directories.
*   Patches were released for multiple distributions including Debian and Gentoo.
