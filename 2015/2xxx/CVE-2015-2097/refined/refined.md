Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2097:

**Multiple Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in WebGate eDVR Manager**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper bounds checking when copying data to fixed-size stack buffers within various ActiveX controls of WebGate eDVR Manager. Specifically, the `LoadImage`, `LoadImageEx`, `ChangePassword` and `Connect` methods of different ActiveX controls are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The core vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow, where more data is written to a stack buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Unsafe ActiveX Controls:** The use of ActiveX controls without proper input validation creates attack surface. The provided exploits use Javascript to interact with the vulnerable ActiveX controls
    *   **Multiple Vulnerable Methods:** The vulnerability is present in different ActiveX controls and their respective methods (LoadImage, LoadImageEx, ChangePassword, and Connect).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the context of the browser. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
    *   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires the victim to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious HTML file.
    *   **Internet Explorer:** The exploits are designed to work with Internet Explorer, leveraging the ActiveX controls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Host Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page containing the exploit code.
    *   **Target Must Visit Malicious Page:** The attacker must entice the target user to visit the malicious page with a vulnerable version of the software installed.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Methods:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable ActiveX controls and their methods.

**Specific Vulnerable Components and Methods:**

*   `WESPMONITORLib.WESPMonitorCtrl`: `LoadImage` method
*   `WESPMONITORLib.WESPMonitorCtrl`: `LoadImageEx` method
*   `WESPCONFIGLib.UserItem`: `ChangePassword` method
*   `WESPSERIALPORTLib.WESPSerialPortCtrl`: `Connect` method
*   `WESPPLAYBACKLib.WESPPlaybackCtrl`: `ConnectEx3` method (mentioned in email, but no specific exploit code provided)

**Mitigation:**

*   **Killbit:** The primary mitigation suggested is setting the killbit for the vulnerable ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer. This prevents the controls from being instantiated within the browser, effectively disabling the attack vector. The registry keys provided in the ZDI advisories are:
    *   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\B19147A0-C2FD-4B1F-BD20-3A3E1ABC4FC3` (for `WESPMonitor.WESPMonitorCtrl`)
        * Set `Compatibility Flags` DWORD to `0x00000400`
    *   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\BAAA6516-267C-466D-93F5-C504EF973837` (for `WESPSerialPort.WESPSerialPortCtrl`)
         * Set `Compatibility Flags` DWORD to `0x00000400`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were disclosed by ZDI after a 120-day deadline passed without a vendor patch.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor but the vendor was unresponsive.
*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to trigger the buffer overflows and achieve remote code execution.
* The vulnerability affects different versions of the software including the version 1, 6, 42, 0.
* The vulnerabilities have been tested on Windows XP SP3 using IE6/7/8.
