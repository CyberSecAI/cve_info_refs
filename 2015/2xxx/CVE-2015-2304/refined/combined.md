# USN-2549-1: libarchive vulnerabilities

25 March 2015

libarchive could be made to crash or overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libarchive](/security/cves?package=libarchive) - Library to read/write archive files

## Details

It was discovered that the libarchive bsdcpio utility extracted absolute

paths by default without using the --insecure flag, contrary to

expectations. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting

cpio archives containing absolute paths, a remote attacker may be able to

write to arbitrary files. ([CVE-2015-2304](/security/CVE-2015-2304))

Fabian Yamaguchi discovered that libarchive incorrectly handled certain

type conversions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

libarchive to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-0211](/security/CVE-2013-0211))

  -
  [3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libarchive/3.0.3-6ubuntu1.1)

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

### @ghedo **[ghedo](/ghedo)** commented [Mar 1, 2015](#issue-59393099)

This fixes a directory traversal issue in the cpio tool that was originally reported by [Alexander Cherepanov](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/libarchive-discuss/dN9y1VvE1Qk/Z9uerigjQn0J).

The patch adds a new option `ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_SECURE_NOABSOLUTEPATHS` that disables extraction of absolute paths. It also provides a test case and updates the documentation.

Note that I only implemented this for posix, because I don't have a windows machine to test this on.

Also, a [CVE id was requested for this issue](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/16/7) but none has been assigned yet.

Sorry, something went wrong.

You should include a check here to verify that /tmp/abs was actually created in this case. I think the following is sufficient:

assert\_file\_exists("/tmp/abs")

It would be better, of course, to generate a filename that does not exist before this test, then check that it does not exist after this test.

| This is a nice start. The tests need a few more checks to verify that the security check really does prevent or not prevent the file creation. (Right now, you're just verifying that the security check returns an error.) |

| Should be fixed now. I use `assertFileExists("/tmp/abs")`, then `unlink("/tmp/abs")` in the test without the flag, and `assertFileNotExists("/tmp/abs")` in the one with the flag.  Not sure if using `unlink()` is ok though. |

| I'm wondering if this fix is correct for the `cpio -dumpl <abspath>` case, used in quite a few scripts (FreeBSD ports's macro ${COPY\_TREE\_SHARE} as a prime example) to hardlink something from place a to b, falling back top copy if no hardlink is possible.  The error is thrown on the path that is the combination of the argument and the relative path provided by stdin. So if input path is verified to be relative and abspath argument is identical to it's realpath, there is no issue and the error thrown is a false positive. Please correct me if I'm missing something here. |

Subject: Directory traversals in cpio and friends?

Hi!

I've taken a look at how dir traversals are dealt with in several
implementations of tar and cpio. The picture is kinda strange.

First of all, I believe it's usually agreed that archivers must not
touch files outside the current directory by default. Is there an
authoritative link for this?

Then, it seems there are 3 main ways to exploit dir traversals in
through archives:

1) via absolute paths, the column 'abs' below;

2) via relative paths with '..', the column 'rel' below;

3) via symlinks to directories, the column 'link' below.

Software:

1) GNU tar and cpio, called 'tar' and 'cpio' below, tested versions from
Debian jessie and git head;

2) BSD tar and cpio (based on libarchive), called 'bsdtar' and 'bsdcpio'
below, tested versions from Debian jessie and git head;

3) OpenBSD-derived(?) pax, with tools called 'paxtar', 'paxcpio' and
'pax' below, tested versions from Debian jessie and FreeBSD
10.0-RELEASE-p12.

The results of tests of tar and cpio archives against various commands
follow. '=' means that the corresponding file is not extracted, 'x'
means that it is extracted. IMHO secure configuration should list three
'=', insecure configuration should list three 'x', everything else is
inconsistent. The list created by the attached scripts.

=== tar ===
abs     rel     link    cmd
=       =       =       tar -x
x       x       x       tar -x -P
=       =       =       bsdtar -x
x       x       x       bsdtar -x -P
=       x       x       paxtar -x
x       x       x       paxtar -x -P
x       x       x       pax -r

=== cpio ===
abs     rel     link    cmd
x       x       x       cpio -i
=       =       x       cpio -i --no-absolute-filenames
x       =       =       bsdcpio -i
x       x       x       bsdcpio -i --insecure
x       x       x       paxcpio -i

tar and bsdtar are ok. Good. But not much.

Question 1. Perhaps there are some reasons why all cpio variants (unlike
tar) extract files with absolute paths by default?

Question 2. BSD folks which are behind pax* tools don't consider
directory traversal a vulnerability, do they?

The only 'x' in the line for `cpio -i --no-absolute-filenames` seems to
be a clear vuln. Reported here: <https://bugs.debian.org/774669> and now
sent to upstream ml.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=800024#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2013-01-23 08:06:20 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED, via private distros list.  However as it seems the overflow only happens when writing files. It is a rather uncommon case to control size arguments there in a service/suid that is using libarchive. Therefore I think its sufficient to fix Factory.  From: Fabian Yamaguchi To: distros   Hello,  I would like to report a buffer overflow in libarchive, which can be triggered on 64 bit systems where sizeof(size_t) is 8. In function archive_write_zip_data in libarchive/archive_write_set_format_zip.c, the parameter "s" of type size_t (64 bit, unsigned) is cast to a signed 64 bit integer before comparing to "zip->remaining_data_bytes" on line 402. If "s" is larger than MAX_INT, "(int64_t)s > zip->remaining_data_bytes)" will always be false. In consequence, "s" will not be set to "zip->remaining_data_bytes" eventhough it is larger than "zip->remaining_data_bytes". This leads to a buffer-overflow when calling "deflate" on line 421.  The relevant code snippet, a small c program to trigger the issue and a debug trace have been attached. Personally, I think this bug is rather moderate in severity since it requires a privileged program using libarchive, which allows negative values to be passed to the library function "archive_write_data". Then again, it's a buffer-overflow, so I have decided not to submit it to the public bug-tracking system.  I hope this information is of use to you. Please put me in CC for replies since I'm not on the list.  Best Regards, Fabian Yamaguchi  - --- Vulnerable Code ---  static ssize_t archive_write_zip_data(struct archive_write *a, const void *buff, size_t s) {         /* ... */          if ((int64_t)s > zip->remaining_data_bytes)    // 402                 s = (size_t)zip->remaining_data_bytes;          if (s == 0) return 0;          switch (zip->compression) {         case COMPRESSION_STORE:                 /* */                 return (s); #if HAVE_ZLIB_H         case COMPRESSION_DEFLATE:                 zip->stream.next_in = (unsigned char*)(uintptr_t)buff;                 zip->stream.avail_in = s;                 do {                         ret = deflate(&zip->stream, Z_NO_FLUSH); // 421                         /* ... */                 } while (zip->stream.avail_in != 0);                 zip->remaining_data_bytes -= s;                 /* If we have it, use zlib's fast crc32() */                 l->crc32 = crc32(l->crc32, buff, s);                 return (s); #endif          default:                 archive_set_error(&a->archive, ARCHIVE_ERRNO_MISC,                     "Invalid ZIP compression type");                 return ARCHIVE_FATAL;         } }  - --- /Vulnerable Code ---   - --- Program to trigger the bug ---  // Compile: gcc ./t.c -o t -g -larchive  #ifdef __linux__ #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64 #endif #include <sys/stat.h> #include <archive.h> #include <archive_entry.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h>  struct mydata {   const char *name;   int fd; };  char *outname = "foo.archive"; char *toPack = "foo";  int myopen(struct archive *a, void *client_data) {         struct mydata *mydata = client_data;          printf("Opening %s for writing\n", mydata->name);         mydata->fd = open(mydata->name, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);         if (mydata->fd >= 0)                 return (ARCHIVE_OK);         else                 return (ARCHIVE_FATAL); }  ssize_t mywrite(struct archive *a, void *client_data, const void *buff, size_t n) {         struct mydata *mydata = client_data;         return (write(mydata->fd, buff, n)); }  int myclose(struct archive *a, void *client_data) {         struct mydata *mydata = client_data;          if (mydata->fd > 0)                 close(mydata->fd);         return (0); }  void write_archive() {         struct mydata *mydata = malloc(sizeof(struct mydata));         struct archive *a;         struct archive_entry *entry;         struct stat st;         char buff[8192];         int len;         int fd;          a = archive_write_new();         mydata->name = outname;         archive_write_set_compression_gzip(a);         archive_write_set_format_zip(a);         archive_write_open(a, mydata, myopen, mywrite, myclose);          stat(toPack, &st);         entry = archive_entry_new();         archive_entry_copy_stat(entry, &st);         archive_entry_set_pathname(entry, toPack);         archive_write_header(a, entry);          fd = open(toPack, O_RDONLY);         len = read(fd, buff, sizeof(buff));          // this is the important call         archive_write_data(a, buff, -1);         //          archive_entry_free(entry);         archive_write_finish(a); }  int main(int argc, const char **argv) {         write_archive();         return 0; }  - --- /Program to trigger the bug ---  - --- Trace ---  (gdb) b archive_write_zip_data Function "archive_write_zip_data" not defined.

Here is his reply.  I tend to agree with his analysis that this is a minor issue as it can only cause the calling process to crash, at best.  Should we just consider this as a normal bugfix?  The proposed fix is not yet committed to any public repository but we plan to do it on Wednesday if nobody objects.  ===  It looks very minor to me, since:    * archive_write_header is declared to take an unsigned size_t      argument.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that gcc -Wall      complains about the signed/unsigned mismatch.      (Passing a literal negative value to an unsigned argument      seems worth at least a warning to me.)    * It's a read buffer overflow, not a write overflow, so I don't      think it's exploitable.    * You can also get a SEGV by calling write(2) with      a size argument of -1.  Here's one possible fix.   Note that archive_write_data() is documented to return the number of bytes actually written, so this just puts a limit on the largest write request.

CVE Name: CVE-2015-2304
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The libarchive(3) library provides a flexible interface for reading and
writing streaming archive files such as tar(1) and cpio(1), and has been the
basis for the FreeBSD implementation of the tar(1) and cpio(1) utilities
since FreeBSD 5.3.
II. Problem Description
The cpio(1) tool from the libarchive(3) bundle is vulnerable to a directory
traversal problem via absolute paths in an archive file.
III. Impact
A malicious archive file being unpacked can overwrite an arbitrary file on
a filesystem, if the owner of the cpio process has write access to it.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Reboot is not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Reboot is not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
