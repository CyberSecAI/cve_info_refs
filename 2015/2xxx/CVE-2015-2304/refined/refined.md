{
  "CVE-2015-2304": {
    "description": "The libarchive bsdcpio utility extracted absolute paths by default without using the --insecure flag, contrary to expectations. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting cpio archives containing absolute paths, a remote attacker may be able to write to arbitrary files.",
    "root_cause": "The bsdcpio utility in libarchive did not properly restrict the extraction of files with absolute paths by default.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the file system by crafting a malicious cpio archive with absolute paths, if the user or process extracting the archive has write access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted cpio archive containing absolute paths"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to create a malicious cpio archive and trick a user or automated system into extracting it."
