- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs when calculating the memory allocation size for a paragraph in a HanWord document. Specifically, the program accepts a maximum paragraph size of 0x7fffffff, and during calculations, this value is multiplied by four. When the size is 0x7fffffff, this multiplication results in an overflow in the 32-bit register, causing a significantly smaller memory allocation than intended.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to heap corruption. The program doesn't properly validate the result of the paragraph size calculation before allocating memory, resulting in a buffer that is smaller than expected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can cause a denial of service or potentially influence program execution flow due to heap corruption. The overwritten instruction pointer shown in the crash details illustrates a possible arbitrary code execution scenario.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted HanWord document with a large paragraph size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a HanWord document with a paragraph size that triggers the integer overflow. The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open the malicious document with a vulnerable version of the HanWord software.
