Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2859

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper certificate validation in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO). Specifically, ePO fails to verify the signing certificate authority (CA) as well as the common name (CN) or domain name (DN) listed in a certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept and manipulate HTTPS traffic between the ePO application and registered servers.
- This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- The attack exploits the lack of proper SSL/TLS certificate validation when communicating with external registered servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the ePO application and registered servers. This typically means being on the same network segment or in a position to route/intercept traffic.
- The attacker must be able to present a forged certificate.

**Affected Software:**
- McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator versions 4.6.8 and earlier, and 5.1.1 and earlier.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator versions 4.6.9 or 5.1.2 or later, which address the vulnerability.
- Refer to McAfee Knowledge Base article KB84628 for additional steps to enforce certificate validation.
