## McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator fails to properly validate SSL/TLS certificates

#### Vulnerability Note VU#264092

Original Release Date: 2015-06-04 | Last Revised: 2015-06-05

---

### Overview

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator versions 4.6.8 and earlier and 5.1.1 and earlier fail to properly validate SSL/TLS certificates.

### Description

| [**CWE-295**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)**: Improper Certificate Validation -**CVE-2015-2859  McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) supports integration with external registered servers for a variety of purposes, such as data collection and aggregation. Optionally, ePO can be configured to use SSL/TLS to encrypt communications with registered servers. McAfee ePO fails to verify the signing certificate authority (CA) as well as the common name (CN) or domain name (DN) listed in a certificate. Consequently, these communication links are susceptible to man-in-the-middle interception and spoofing attacks.For more information, refer to McAfee's [security bulletin SB10120](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10120). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can intercept and manipulate HTTPS traffic between the ePO application and registered servers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**McAfee has released versions 4.6.9 and 5.1.2 to address this and other issues. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version available and should refer to the vendor's [Knowledge Base KB84628](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB84628) article specifying additional steps that are required to enforce certificate validation. |
