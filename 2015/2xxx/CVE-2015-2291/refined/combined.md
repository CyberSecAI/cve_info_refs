Intel is focused on ensuring the security of our customers computing environments. We are committed to rapidly addressing issues as they arise, and providing recommendations through security advisories and security [announcements](/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/default.html).

### Report a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability with an **Intel branded product or technology**, please send an e-mail to secure@intel.com. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP public key](/content/www/us/en/security-center/pgp-public-key.html).

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

* The products and versions affected
* Detailed description of the vulnerability
* Information on known exploits

A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see:

* [Vulnerability handling guidelines](/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html)

For issues related to Intel's external web presence (Intel.com and related subdomains), please contact Intel's External Security Research team.

### Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products. Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues, Intel created its Bug Bounty Program. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability.

Watch this video, [So You Found a Vulnerability](/content/www/us/en/security-center/so-you-found-a-vulnerability.html), to find out what you can expect when participating in the Intel® Bug Bounty Program.

### Intel Security Vulnerability Researcher Community Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](/content/www/us/en/security-center/Code_of_Conduct.html) applies to all interactions among persons reporting or discussing security issues with Intel employees (‘Community Members’). It outlines the expected/acceptable standards of behavior, classifies some unacceptable behaviors, and describes possible enforcement actions for the Community Member interactions if unacceptable behavior arises during crowdsourced security vulnerability research such as the Intel® Bug Bounty Program, Project Circuit Breaker, vulnerability reporting, or any other communications interactions such as slack channels, email communication, or in person communications.

Description:
A vulnerability in iqvw32.sys and iqvw64e.sys drivers has been discovered in Intel Network Adapter Driver.

The vulnerability exists due to insuffiecient input buffer validation when the driver processes IOCTL codes 0x80862013,
0x8086200B, 0x8086200F, 0x80862007 using METHOD_NEITHER and due to insecure permissions allowing everyone read and write
access to privileged use only functionality.

Attackers can exploit this issue to cause a Denial of Service or possibly execute arbitrary code in kernel space.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
