The provided content relates to CVE-2015-2744.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `innerHTML` in the Gaia Search app's code. Specifically, the search app was using `innerHTML` to set the title of search results, allowing for the injection of HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTML injection vulnerability due to the use of `innerHTML` instead of `textContent`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML, including iframes with `mozbrowser` and `mozapp` attributes, into the search results page.
- This could lead to the embedding of other applications (like the FM Radio app) within the Search app's context, potentially leading to further exploitation.
- Could potentially execute scripts within the search app's context, although CSP would mitigate some attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing HTML tags, especially an iframe with `mozbrowser` and `mozapp` attributes.
- The user opens this malicious link using the search app, and the injected HTML is rendered on the search results page.
- When the user re-opens the search app, the injected content persists.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious URL that will be processed by the search app.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, but relies on the applicationâ€™s vulnerability to inject HTML into the search app.
