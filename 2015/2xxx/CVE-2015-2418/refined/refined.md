Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists within the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT). This occurs when the MSRT doesn't properly handle a specific sequence of events related to loading a dynamic link library (.dll).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition when MSRT attempts to load a .dll file. This creates a window where a malicious .dll can be substituted in place of the expected one.
- **DLL Planting:** The attacker leverages the race condition by placing a specially crafted .dll file in a local directory, which is then loaded by MSRT due to the race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges on the target system.
- **System Compromise:** With elevated privileges, an attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Potential for System Unresponsiveness:** Exploitation could cause the operating system or an application to become permanently unresponsive until restarted. An application may also quit unexpectedly without recovering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have prior access to the target system, requiring the ability to log on and place files in a local directory.
- **DLL Planting:** The attacker needs to place a malicious .dll file in a directory where MSRT will look for it.
- **Timing:** The attacker exploits a race condition and needs MSRT to execute after the malicious .dll has been planted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system using a valid account.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to a directory on the system where the malicious .dll can be placed.
- **Awareness of MSRT execution:** The attacker needs to know when the MSRT is likely to be executed (either automatically or by a user) to take advantage of the timing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in MSRT version 5.26 or later.
- Microsoft is releasing an advisory rather than a full security bulletin, emphasizing automatic updates.
- The advisory also emphasizes that no user action is typically required to address this vulnerability, as the update is applied automatically.
