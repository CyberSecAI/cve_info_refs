Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service handles incoming network packets. Specifically, a specially crafted sequence of packets can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of RDP packets within the terminal service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new user accounts with full administrative privileges.
-  While denial of service is the most likely outcome, remote code execution is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted sequence of RDP packets to a system with the RDP server service enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system with the RDP server service enabled. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The RDP server is not enabled by default.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for affected versions of Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.
- Systems without the RDP server service enabled are not vulnerable.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the terminal service processes packets.
