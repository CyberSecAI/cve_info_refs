Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2460:

**1. Verification:**

The provided documents directly mention **CVE-2015-2460** as an "OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability". The vulnerability is described as a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS15-080) due to improper handling of specially crafted OpenType fonts. The exploit-db entry also confirms that CVE-2015-2460 is related to an invalid memory access in the `ATMFD.dll` when handling OpenType fonts, which aligns with the vulnerability description.

**2. Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the improper handling of specially crafted OpenType fonts by the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library (specifically `ATMFD.dll`). This leads to an invalid memory access.
*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `ATMFD.dll` processes the CFF table within OpenType fonts, leading to a use-after-free condition or corruption of a linked list within the code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Invalid Memory Access:** A read operation from an invalid memory location caused by an out-of-bounds or use-after-free scenario while processing the font data.
*   **Improper Handling of Font Data:** The vulnerability highlights an error in how `ATMFD.dll` processes potentially malicious or corrupted font data structures.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Kernel-Level Access:** The exploit may cause a crash in the kernel, and if correctly crafted can lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel security context.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Documents:** An attacker could embed the malicious OpenType font in a document and trick the user into opening it.
*   **Untrusted Webpages:** An attacker could host the malicious font on a webpage and lure a user to visit it, triggering the vulnerability when the font is loaded.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify Font Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify font files to include the malicious font data.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to open a malicious document or visit a malicious webpage.
*   **Remote Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, requiring no prior access to the target system.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a specific crash location (`ATMFD+0x3440b` / `ATMFD+0x3440e`) in the `ATMFD.dll`.
*   It notes that the `ESI` register contains a bad memory address that leads to the crash, due to a use-after-free condition or linked list corruption.
*   It also specifies that the vulnerability is reproducible in Windows 7 and 8.1 and easier to trigger with Special Pools enabled.
*   The exploit-db entry confirms the issue's similarity to another related bug (issue 383), but it's treated separately due to different crash locations.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-2460 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability stemming from improper handling of OpenType fonts by the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library (`ATMFD.dll`). Attackers can exploit this by enticing users to interact with malicious documents or webpages containing specially crafted fonts. Successful exploitation allows complete control over a target system. The exploit-db entry provides technical details and crash locations related to the vulnerability within `ATMFD.dll`, suggesting an invalid memory access due to a use-after-free or corrupted data structure.
