Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way MediaWiki's `Html::expandAttributes` method handles attribute escaping in combination with LanguageConverter substitutions. Specifically, `Html::expandAttributes` was designed to be "cute" and avoid unnecessary escaping of characters like `>`, which, while technically correct in certain HTML contexts, becomes problematic when combined with LanguageConverter. The LanguageConverter performs macro-like substitutions after HTML sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The core issue is that the LanguageConverter performs substitutions *after* HTML sanitization, bypassing the intended security measures of the HTML class.
*   **Inconsistent HTML Escaping:** The `Html::element` and `Html::rawElement` methods attempt to avoid unnecessary escaping (e.g., not escaping `>` inside an attribute enclosed in quotes), which contrasts with the behavior of the sanitizer class and creates an opportunity for exploitation.
*   **Regex Parsing Issues:** The LanguageConverter uses regex to exclude HTML tags from being converted. The regex was not comprehensive and could be bypassed by inserting a tag with an attribute containing a non-escaped `>` character.
*   **Reliance on `preg_match` Return Value:** A related issue, discovered later, was that if `preg_match` hits a recursion limit, it will silently return false.  If the application does not handle this case properly the regex can fail to match and allow the vulnerability to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of other users, steal session cookies, or deface the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting malicious code, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the MediaWiki application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through user-controlled content that is passed through both `Html::element` (or `Html::rawElement`) and then processed by the language converter using macro substitutions.
*   The exploit involves creating wikitext with an attribute containing a non-escaped `>` character. An example is by using the Special:Contributions page to set the target attribute. This can then be combined with a LanguageConverter substitution to inject JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account to create or modify pages with the malicious wikitext.
*   **Language Setting:** The attacker needs to set a language with variants (e.g., 'zh', 'sr') to exploit the LanguageConverter functionality.
*   **Specific Wikitext:** The attacker needs to insert specific wikitext that utilizes `Html::element` or `Html::rawElement` in conjunction with a language conversion string.
*   **Knowledge of Affected Parameters:**  The attacker needs to know what page inputs are sanitized using `Html::element` or `Html::rawElement` in order to exploit them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MediaWiki versions since approximately 1.17.
*   The issue was initially reported by MediaWiki user Bawolff.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the `>` character is encoded in `Html::expandAttributes`. A more robust method using an HTML5 parser was later implemented.
* The content also mentions that this issue can be exploited on wikis with a non-variant language if it is possible to set the page language to be a language with variants.
*   A related issue using a long string with many attributes in combination with the vulnerability could cause a DoS when the recursion limit of preg_match is hit.
* The fix involves changing the `Html::expandAttributes` to escape `>`, along with updating parser tests.
* Related to issue is a similar potential vulnerability where `<` is not escaped in `Html::escape`, although the root issue that was present in the language converter was patched in this CVE.
* This vulnerability is mentioned in later CVEs: CVE-2017-8812 and CVE-2017-8815.
