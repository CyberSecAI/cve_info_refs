Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion error in how Microsoft Office handles the `OLESSDirectyEntry.CreateTime` field within a file. Specifically, the `CreateTime` field is not being processed with the correct type information, leading to memory corruption.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted file with a modified `CreateTime` field is opened.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is that the software interprets the `CreateTime` field as a different type than it actually is. This leads to using a pointer with incorrect type data, and eventually, a corrupted memory address.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  The type confusion leads to dereferencing a corrupted pointer, resulting in the corruption of memory.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The Application Verifier crash reveals an out-of-bounds read where an offset of 0x3f0 is applied to a memory chunk that was only allocated with a size of 0x1b0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the system, including installing software, modifying data, and creating new accounts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The initial crash without Application Verifier shows the program crashing with a corrupted EIP, which in itself could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (e.g., Excel file in the provided proof of concept).
*   **Email/Web:** The attacker can deliver the malicious file via email or by hosting the file on a website and tricking the user into downloading and opening it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted File:** The attacker needs to create a malicious Office file that triggers the type confusion vulnerability by manipulating the `OLESSDirectyEntry.CreateTime` field.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit primarily affects Microsoft Office 2007, as noted in the exploit database entry, while the Microsoft security bulletin indicates that the vulnerability affects multiple versions.
*   The provided exploit-db entry includes a proof-of-concept (POC) file demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a single bit delta in the file that modifies the CreateTime field of an OLESSDirectoryEntry structure.
*   The vulnerability was found by Google Security Research.

The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-099 confirms the existence of memory corruption vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-2521, that could lead to remote code execution, stating that the vulnerability is due to how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.
