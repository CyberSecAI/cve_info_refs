Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2994:

**CVE-2015-2994**

*   **Vulnerability:** File upload via directory traversal
*   **Root cause:** The `ChangePhoto.jsp` endpoint allows uploading files with a predictable temporary filename. By crafting a malicious filename, an attacker can bypass checks and upload a JSP file to an arbitrary location. The application uses a predictable temporary file name, facilitating the execution of the uploaded JSP file.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Directory traversal vulnerability.
    *   Insecure file upload handling.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious JSP file.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/sysaid/ChangePhoto.jsp` with a multipart/form-data payload including a malicious JSP file with a predictable file name.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   A valid administrator account is needed to exploit this vulnerability directly. However, this can be obtained by exploiting CVE-2015-2993
    *  Network access to the vulnerable SysAid server.
*   **Technical Details**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to `/sysaid/ChangePhoto.jsp?isUpload=true` with a multipart form including a jsp file
    *   The response returns a page with the file url, which can then be accessed.
    *   The uploaded file is saved in the `icons/user_photo/` directory.
    *   The attacker can then navigate to the uploaded file to execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability allows for remote code execution which can lead to full system compromise.
