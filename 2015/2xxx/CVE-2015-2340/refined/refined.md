- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how `TPInt.dll` incorrectly handles memory allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory handling leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the Windows OS that runs the affected VMware product (Workstation or Horizon Client).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - For Workstation: A guest operating system may be able to trigger the vulnerability.
    - For Horizon Client: A View desktop may be able to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have some level of access to either the guest OS in Workstation or the View desktop when using the Horizon Client.
