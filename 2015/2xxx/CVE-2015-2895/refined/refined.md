**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The application crashes when an input larger than 1024 bytes is sent.
- Remote code execution is considered likely, though not definitively proven in the report.
- Denial of service can be achieved by causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attackers on the network can send specially crafted commands with an oversized input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the port the Up.time agent is listening on.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Affected Versions:**
- Version 7.4

**Patched Version:**
