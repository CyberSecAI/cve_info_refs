Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper substring check within the `ExportEtherpad.js` file of Etherpad. When exporting a pad using a specific pad ID, the system incorrectly used a substring match instead of an exact match. This caused the system to return all pads where the requested ID was a substring of the actual pad ID, regardless of access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the unintentional exposure of data from multiple pads when exporting a specific pad ID.
- **Incorrect Substring Matching:** The use of a substring check rather than an exact match for pad IDs during export is the direct cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to the content of other pads they were not authorized to view, by crafting a specific substring to get multiple pads. This can result in a significant leak of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection.
- **Manipulated Pad ID:** An attacker would use a crafted pad ID as a substring of other existing pad IDs, when making an export request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Etherpad instance.
- **Knowledge of Pad IDs:** The attacker needs some awareness or the ability to discover pad IDs to formulate the substring attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `src/node/utils/ExportEtherpad.js` file.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 1.5.2 of Etherpad.
- The vulnerability is classified as a high severity issue by the GitHub Advisory Database.
