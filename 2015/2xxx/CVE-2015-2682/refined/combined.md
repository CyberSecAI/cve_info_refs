Abstract

It was discovered that Citrix Command Center stores configuration files containing credentials of managed devices within a folder accessible through the web server. Unauthenticated attackers can download any configuration file stored in this folder, decode passwords stored in these files, and gain privileged access to devices managed by Command Center.

Tested version

This issue was discovered in Citrix Command Center 5.1 build 33.3 (including patch CC_SP_5.2_40_1.exe), other versions may also be vulnerable.

Fix

Citrix reports that this vulnerability is fixed in Command Center 5.2 build 42.7, which can be downloaded from the following location (login required).
https://www.citrix.com/downloads/command-center/product-software/command-center-52-427.html

Citrix assigned BUG0493933 to this issue.

Introduction

Citrix Command Center is a management and monitoring solution for Citrix application networking products. Command Center enables network administrators and operations teams to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot the entire global application delivery infrastructure from a single, unified console.

Citrix Command Center stores configuration files containing credentials of managed devices within a folder accessible through the web server. No access control is enforced on this folder, an unauthenticated attacker can download any configuration file stored in this folder.

Details

Configuration files can be downloaded from the conf web folder. Below is an example of a configuration file that can be obtained this way.

https://<target>:8443/conf/securitydbData.xml

This files contains encoded passwords, for example:

<DATA ownername="NULL" password="C70A0eE9os9T2z" username="root"/>

These passwords can be decoded trivially. The algorithm used can be found in the JAR file NmsServerClasses.jar. For example the encoded password C70A0eE9os9T2z decodes to SECURIFY123. The credentials stored in these files can than be used to gain privileged access to devices managed by Command Center.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Citrix Command Center stores configuration files containing credentials of managed devices within a folder accessible through the web server. No access control is enforced on this folder, an unauthenticated attacker can download any configuration file stored in this folder.

## Details

Configuration files can be downloaded from the `conf` web folder. Below is an example of a configuration file that can be obtained this way.

[https://:8443/conf/securitydbData.xml](https://%3Ctarget%3E:8443/conf/securitydbData.xml)

This files contains encoded passwords, for example:

```
<DATA ownername="NULL" password="**C70A0eE9os9T2z**" username="root"/>

```

These passwords can be decoded trivially. The algorithm used can be found in the JAR file `NmsServerClasses.jar`. For example the encoded password `C70A0eE9os9T2z` decodes to `SECURIFY123`. The credentials stored in these files can than be used to gain privileged access to devices managed by Command Center.
