## Vulnerability Information

## OpenType Font Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2426

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had information to indicate that this vulnerability was public but did not have any information to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers. Our analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Rename ATMFD.DLL**

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (disable ATMFD):**

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key (or create it) and set its DWORD value to 1:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 1
3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

**Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
   "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001

   ```

```
2.  Run **regedit.exe**.
3.  In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
4.  Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
    (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5.  Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

```

**Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will not display properly. Disabling ATMFD.DLL could cause certain applications to stop working properly if they use OpenType fonts. Microsoft Windows does not release any OpenType fonts natively. However, third-party applications could install them and they could be affected by this change.

**How to undo the workaround.**

**For 32-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

   ```
   cd "%windir%\system32"
   rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
   icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
   icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

   ```
2. Restart the system.

**For 64-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

   ```
   cd "%windir%\system32"
   rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
   icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
   icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl
   cd "%windir%\syswow64"
   rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
   icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
   icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

   ```

```
2.  Restart the system.

```

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (enable ATMFD):**

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key and set its DWORD value to 0:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 0

```
3.  Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

```

**Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

   `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

   `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]`

   `"DisableATMFD"=dword:00000000`

```
2.  Run **regedit.exe**.
3.  In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
4.  Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
    (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5.  Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
