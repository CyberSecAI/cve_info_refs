Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the `templates/openid-selector.tmpl` file of ikiwiki. This flaw arises due to the improper handling of the `openid_identifier` parameter when processing a verify action in `ikiwiki.cgi`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically reflected XSS, where user-supplied input is displayed without proper sanitization or encoding.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `openid_identifier` parameter is not being properly sanitized, allowing injection of malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code or HTML into the web page viewed by a user.
- **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal user cookies, leading to session hijacking.
- **Other Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform various other malicious actions depending on the injected script, including redirection, data exfiltration or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `openid_identifier` parameter within an HTTP request to `ikiwiki.cgi`.
- **Specifically `ikiwiki.cgi?action=verify&do=signin&openid_identifier=<payload>`**
- **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user when the page is rendered in the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `openid_identifier` parameter is vulnerable and where to send the malicious payload.
- **Ability to craft malicious payload:** Attacker needs to craft a valid XSS payload using JavaScript or HTML to inject.

**Additional notes:**
-  The vulnerability was publicly reported before a patch was available, but the maintainers have since released a fix.
-  The vulnerability is fixed in ikiwiki versions 3.20150329, 3.20141016.2, and 3.20120629.2.
- Multiple proofs of concepts of how to exploit the vulnerability are provided in the provided content.
