    "relates_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "The `orderby` and `order` GET parameters in `admin/class-bulk-editor-list-table.php` are not sufficiently sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "By enticing an authenticated admin, editor, or author user to click on a specially crafted link or visit a page controlled by the attacker.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (admin, editor, or author) into clicking a malicious link. An unauthenticated remote attacker can leverage CSRF due to the lack of anti-CSRF protection in the vulnerable plugin. The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerable parameter names and the structure of the SQL queries."
