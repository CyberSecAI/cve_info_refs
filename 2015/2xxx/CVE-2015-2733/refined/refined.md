Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2733:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Use-after-free error in the `CanonicalizeXPCOMParticipant` function. This function is related to the handling of XPCOM (Cross Platform Component Object Model) participants within Mozilla's architecture. The vulnerability occurs specifically when an `XMLHttpRequest` object is used in conjunction with a dedicated worker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that memory associated with an `XMLHttpRequest` object is freed while the worker is still attempting to use it.
*   The vulnerability is triggered specifically with dedicated workers and `XMLHttpRequest` objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application (Firefox/Thunderbird).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage.
*   **Web Browser Exploitation**: The attacker would need to serve a malicious web page containing JavaScript code that leverages workers and `XMLHttpRequest` objects to trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a crafted webpage to the user.
*   **JavaScript Proficiency:** The attacker must create JavaScript code that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Mozilla Firefox before version 39.0, Firefox ESR versions 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird before 38.1.
*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of object lifetimes, specifically when workers are involved in the use of `XMLHttpRequest` objects.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSSv2 base score of 10, indicating a critical severity.
*   The use-after-free occurs when a content policy modifies the DOM to remove an object that is still being used by the XMLHttpRequest API within a dedicated worker.

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved changes in the `nsCycleCollector.cpp` file, as well as specific changes to the handling of workers and `XMLHttpRequest` objects in DOM code.

*   Multiple sources confirm the presence of this vulnerability in Firefox and Thunderbird and its resolution in later versions.

*   SUSE, Red Hat, and Ubuntu all issued security advisories to address the vulnerability, affecting multiple versions of their operating systems and other products.
