Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2279

**Root Cause:** OS Command Injection

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **cgi_test.cgi:** The `cgi_test.cgi` binary in AirLive MD-3025, BU-3026, and BU-2015 cameras is vulnerable. It uses the `QUERY_STRING` and checks if it contains certain parameters (write_mac, write_pid, write_msn, write_tan, write_hdv) followed by an ampersand symbol (&). The code then uses `printf` to build a command for the `info_writer` binary, and calls `system()`. By injecting a semicolon (;) after the ampersand, arbitrary OS commands can be executed. There are some length checks on the parameters which limit the injection, but still allows for command execution.
*   **wireless_mft.cgi:** The `wireless_mft.cgi` binary in AirLive WL-2000CAM and POE-200CAM cameras has an OS command injection in the `ap` parameter. It can be exploited using hardcoded credentials ("manufacture":"erutcafunam") of the embedded Boa web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected devices.
*   **Device Compromise:** Complete access to the device, including the ability to read sensitive files such as the user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable CGI files
    *   For `cgi_test.cgi`: No authentication is required unless HTTPS is enabled. The vulnerable parameters can be injected with a semicolon followed by the command.
    *   For `wireless_mft.cgi`: Requires authentication, which can be done with the hardcoded username and password. After authentication, an attacker can inject commands into the `ap` parameter.
*  **Network Access:** Exploitation requires network access to the vulnerable devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable devices on the network.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters and how to structure the injection.
*   **Credentials** for `wireless_mft.cgi` exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability in `cgi_test.cgi` is present in AirLive MD-3025, BU-3026, and BU-2015 cameras.
*   The vulnerability in `wireless_mft.cgi` is present in AirLive WL-2000CAM and POE-200CAM cameras.
*   The vulnerability in `cgi_test.cgi` can be exploited without authentication unless HTTPS is enabled.
*   The vulnerability in `wireless_mft.cgi` requires authentication, which can be bypassed using the hardcoded credentials.
*   The advisory provides Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits for both vulnerabilities.
