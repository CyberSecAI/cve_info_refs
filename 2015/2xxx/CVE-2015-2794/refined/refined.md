{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "DotNetNuke 07.04.00 does not prevent anonymous users from accessing the installation wizard.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted access to the installation wizard, allowing unauthorized users to reinstall the application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can 'reinstall' DNN and gain unauthorized access as a SuperUser.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing the `/Install/InstallWizard.aspx` page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DotNetNuke instance. If the SQL database is not in the default configuration, the attacker may need to know or brute-force the database configuration (server name and filename)."
