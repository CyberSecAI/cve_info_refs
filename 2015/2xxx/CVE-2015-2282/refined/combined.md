SAP <<http://www.sap.com/>>has released the monthly critical patch update
for May 2015. This patch update closes a lot of vulnerabilities in SAP
products, some of them belong in the SAP HANA security area. This month,
three critical vulnerabilities found by ERPScan researchers Dmitry
Chastukhin and Vahagn Vardanyan were closed.
```

*Issues that were patched with the help of ERPScan*

```
The detailed list of corrected vulnerabilities that were found byERPScan
<<http://www.erpscan.com/>>researchers is below.
```

 * A Buffer Overflow vulnerability in SAP Afaria Server (CVSS Base
   Score:7.8). Update is available in SAP Security Note2153690
   <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2153690>>. An attacker can
   use Buffer Overflow to inject specially crafted code into working
   memory. The code will be executed by the vulnerable application
   under the same privileges that the application has. This can lead to
   the attacker taking complete control over the application, denial of
   service, command execution, and other attacks. In case of command
   execution, the attacker can obtain critical technical and
   business-related information stored in the vulnerable SAP system or
   escalate their privileges. As for denial of service, it can
   terminate the process of a vulnerable component. Nobody will be able
   to use this service, which has a negative impact on business
   processes, system downtime, and business reputation.

 * A Missing Authorization Check vulnerability in SAP Afaria (CVSS Base
   Score:7.1). Update is available in SAP Security Note2155690
   <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2155690>>. An attacker can
   use Missing Authorization Checks to access a service without any
   authorization procedures and use the service functionality that has
   restricted access. This can lead to information disclosure,
   privilege escalation, and other attacks.

 * An XML eXternal Entity vulnerability in SAP System Landscape
   Directory (CVSS Base Score:4.9). Update is available in SAP Security
   Note2090851 <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2090851>>. An
   attacker can use XML eXternal Entities to send specially crafted
   unauthorized XML requests, which will be processed by the XML
   parser. The attacker will get unauthorized access to the OS file system.

*The most critical issues found by other researchers*

```
Some of our readers and clients asked us to categorize the most critical
SAP vulnerabilities to patch them first. Companies providing SAP
Security Audit, SAP Security Assessment, or SAP Penetration Testing
services can include these vulnerabilities in their checklists. The most
critical vulnerabilities of this update can be patched by the following
SAP Security Notes:
```

 * 2152278 <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2152278>>: SAP ASE
   Database Platform has an SQL Injection vulnerability (CVSS Base
   Score:8.5). An attacker can use SQL Injection with the help of
   specially crafted SQL queries. They can read and modify sensitive
   information from a database, execute administration operations on a
   database, destroy data or make it unavailable. In some cases, the
   attacker can access system data or execute OS commands. It is
   recommended to install this SAP Security Note to prevent risks.

 * 2121661 <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2121661>>: SAP
   ABAP & Java Server has a Running Process Remote Termination
   vulnerability (CVSS Base Score:8.3). An attacker can use this
   vulnerability to terminate the process of a vulnerable component.
   Nobody will be able to use this service, which has a negative impact
   on business processes, system downtime, and business reputation. It
   is recommended to install this SAP Security Note to prevent risks.

 * 2127995 <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2127995>>: SAP
   Content Server has a Running Process Remote Termination
   vulnerability (CVSS Base Score:8.3). An attacker can use this
   vulnerability to terminate SAP Content Server. Nobody will be able
   to use this service, which has a negative impact on business
   processes, system downtime, and business reputation. It is
   recommended to install this SAP Security Note to prevent risks.

 * 2153892 <<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2153892>>: SAP
   HANA Web-based Development Workbench has an SQL Injection
   vulnerability (CVSS Base Score:6.0). An attacker can use SQL
   Injections with the help of specially crafted SQL queries. They can
   read and modify sensitive information from a database, execute
   administration operations in a database, destroy data or make it
   unavailable. In some cases, the attacker can access system data or
   execute OS commands. It is recommended to install this SAP Security
   Note to prevent risks.

*Remote code execution in SAP applications*

```
Information security researchers have found many vulnerabilities in
LZC/LZH algorithm, using which attackers can execute remote code on
client and server hosts.
```

```
Many server and client SAP applications use the vulnerable compression
algorithm LZC/LZH:
```

 * SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP
 * SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java
 * SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK
 * SAP RFC SDK
 * SAP GUI
 * SAP MaxDB database
 * SAPCAR archive tool

They are also used in the following protocols:

 * Diag
 * RFC
 * MaxDB

Let’s look at the found vulnerabilities in detail.

```
\*1. Stack-based overflow vulnerability CVE-2015-2282 in compression
algorithm LZC\*
```

Vulnerable application code:

|/[..]/
int CsObjectInt::CsDecomprLZC (SAP_BYTE * inbuf,
SAP_INT inlen,
SAP_BYTE * outbuf,
SAP_INT outlen,
SAP_INT option,
SAP_INT * bytes_read,
SAP_INT * bytes_written)
[..]
/* Generate output characters in reverse order ...................*/
while (code >= 256)
{
*stackp++ = TAB_SUFFIXOF(code);
overflow
code = TAB_PREFIXOF(code);
}
[..]|

```
Note that the variable "code" contains an attacker-controlled value,
which results in a stack overflow if the value is greater than 256 and
the value of the code in the prefix table is also greater than 256. It's
possible to fill the stack with arbitrary values by controlling the
values stored in the prefix and suffix tables.
```

*2. Vulnerability CVE-2015-2278 in compression algorithm LZH*

```
Using this vulnerability, an attacker can read data stored outside the
buffer using special package data.
```

Vulnerable code:

|/[..]/
int CsObjectInt::BuildHufTree (
unsigned * b, /* code lengths in bits (all assumed <= BMAX) */
unsigned n, /* number of codes (assumed <= N_MAX) */
unsigned s, /* number of simple-valued codes (0..s-1) */
int * d, /* list of base values for non-simple codes */
int * e, /* list of extra bits for non-simple codes */
HUFTREE **t, /* result: starting table */
int * m) /* maximum lookup bits, returns actual */
[..]
if (p >= v + n)
{
r.e = INVALIDCODE; /* out of values--invalid code */
}
else if (*p < s)
{ /* 256 is end-of-block code */
r.e = (unsigned char)(*p < 256 ? LITCODE : EOBCODE);
r.v.n = (unsigned short) *p; /* simple code is just the value*/
p++;
}
else
{
r.e = (unsigned char) e[*p - s]; /*non-simple,look up in lists*/
r.v.n = (unsigned short) d[*p - s];
p++;
}
[..]|

```
As you can see, arrays 'e' and 'd' are indexed by the values of "\* p -
s". As the value of variables 'p' and 's' are under the attacker’s
control, they also control the values of arrays 'e' and 'd'.
```

*Attack scenarios*

```
As the vulnerability affects a large number of SAP products, there are
multiple attack vectors depending on how the vulnerable code is used in
an SAP program.
```

Examples of vectors:

 * Attack on a server component: SAP NetWeaver services Gateway and
   Dispatcher process compressed data. An attacker can forge requests,
   create a special attack package, and exploit a Remote Code Execution
   vulnerability on the server.

 * Attack on a client component: the attacker can create a special .CAR
   or .SAR package, send it to a client, and when they try to unarchive
   it, the attacker’s commands will be executed on the client's host.

 * MitM attack. As most of the services affected by these issues are
   not encrypted by default, an attacker might be able to perform a
   man-in-the-middle attack and trigger the vulnerabilities by
   injecting malicious packets within the communication.

*Remediation*

```
SAP customers can implement security notes 2124806, 2121661, 2127995,
2125316 at the company's support portal.
```

```
SAP has traditionally issued acknowledgments to the security researchers
on theirwebsite <<http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-8218>>.

---

*From*: CORE Advisories Team <advisories () coresecurity com>

*Date*: Wed, 13 May 2015 13:33:29 -0300

---

```
1. Advisory Information

Title: SAP LZC/LZH Compression Multiple Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0009
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/sap-lzc-lzh-compression-multiple-vulnerabilities>
Date published: 2015-05-12
Date of last update: 2015-05-12
Vendors contacted: SAP
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Out-of-bounds Write [CWE-787], Out-of-bounds Read [CWE-125]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2015-2282, CVE-2015-2278

3. Vulnerability Description

SAP products make use of a proprietary implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Thomas (LZC) adaptive dictionary compression
algorithm and the Lempel-Ziv-Huffman (LZH) compression algorithm [1] . These compression algorithms are used across
several SAP products and programs. Vulnerabilities were found in the decompression routines that could be triggered in
different scenarios, and could lead to execution of arbitrary code and denial of service conditions.

4. Vulnerable Packages

SAP Netweaver Application Server ABAP.
SAP Netweaver Application Server Java.
SAP Netweaver RFC SDK
SAP RFC SDK
SAP GUI
SAP MaxDB database
SAPCAR archive tool
Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

SAP published the following Security Notes:

2124806
2121661
2127995
2125316
They can be accessed by SAP clients in their Support Portal [15].

Developers who used the Open Source versions of MaxDB 7.5 and 7.6 for their tools should contact SAP.

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo from Core Security Consulting Services. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

SAP products make use of LZC and LZH algorithms for compressing in-transit data for different services (Diag protocol,
RFC protocol, MaxDB protocol) and for distributing files (SAPCAR program). The implementation of this algorithm was
also included in Open Source versions of MaxDB 7.5 and 7.6 [2], and used on multiple Open Source security-related
programs [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].

The code that handles the decompression of LZC and LZH compressed data is prone to two memory corruption
vulnerabilities, as described below.

7.1. LZC decompression stack-based buffer overflow

The vulnerability [CVE-2015-2282] is caused by an out-of-bounds write to a stack buffer used by the decompression
routine to write the output characters.

The following snippet of code shows the vulnerable function [file vpa106cslzc.cpp in the MaxDB source code [12]]. This
piece of code can be reached by decompressing a specially crafted buffer.

[..]
int CsObjectInt::CsDecomprLZC (SAP_BYTE * inbuf,
                  SAP_INT    inlen,
                  SAP_BYTE * outbuf,
                  SAP_INT    outlen,
                  SAP_INT    option,
                  SAP_INT *  bytes_read,
                  SAP_INT *  bytes_written)
    [..]
    /* Generate output characters in reverse order ...................*/
    while (code >= 256)
    {
      *stackp++ = TAB_SUFFIXOF(code);
      OVERFLOW_CHECK
      code = TAB_PREFIXOF(code);
    }
[..]
Note that the "code" variable contains an attacker controlled value, resulting in a stack overflow if the value is
greater than 256 and the value for that code in the prefix table is also greater than 256. It's possible to fill in the
stack with arbitrary values by controlling the values stored in the prefix and suffix tables.

It's also worth mentioning that the above code includes a macro for performing some bounds checks on the stack pointer
("OVERFLOW_CHECK"). However, the check implemented by this macro is not sufficient for avoiding this vulnerability and
also could lead to fault conditions when decompressing valid buffers. Moreover, vulnerable products and programs were
built without this macro enabled ("CS_STACK_CHECK" macro not defined at the time of compilation).

7.2. LZH decompression out-of-bounds read

The vulnerability [CVE-2015-2278] is caused by an out-of-bounds read of a buffer used by the decompression routine when
performing look-ups of non-simple codes.

The following piece of code shows the vulnerable function [file vpa108csulzh.cpp in the MaxDB source code [13]]. This
piece of code can be reached by decompressing a specially crafted buffer.

[..]
int CsObjectInt::BuildHufTree (
             unsigned * b,  /* code lengths in bits (all assumed <= BMAX) */
             unsigned   n,  /* number of codes (assumed <= N_MAX) */
             unsigned   s,  /* number of simple-valued codes (0..s-1) */
             int      * d,  /* list of base values for non-simple codes */
             int      * e,  /* list of extra bits for non-simple codes */
             HUFTREE  **t,  /* result: starting table */
             int      * m)  /* maximum lookup bits, returns actual */
    [..]
      if (p >= v + n)
      {
        r.e = INVALIDCODE;             /* out of values--invalid code */
      }
      else if (*p < s)
      {                         /* 256 is end-of-block code */
        r.e = (unsigned char)(*p < 256 ? LITCODE : EOBCODE);
        r.v.n = (unsigned short) *p;  /* simple code is just the value*/
        p++;
      }
      else
      {
        r.e = (unsigned char) e[*p - s]; /*non-simple,look up in lists*/
        r.v.n = (unsigned short) d[*p - s];
        p++;
      }
[..]

The "e" and "d" arrays are indexed with the value of "*p - s" which is an attacker-controlled value. When the code is
reached, this results in an out-of-bounds read access.

7.3. Attack scenarios

The vulnerabilities affect a varied range of products and programs. The attack scenarios differ based on the way each
product makes use of the compression libraries. At very least the following scenarios can be identified:

7.3.1. Attacks against server-side components

SAP Netweaver services like Dispatcher or Gateway handle compressed requests coming from the different clients
connecting to them. A remote unauthenticated attacker might be able to connect to the aforementioned services and
trigger the vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted packets.

7.3.2. Client-side attacks

An attacker might be able to perform client-side attacks against users of the affected programs that handle compressed
data. For instance, an attacker might send a specially crafted .CAR or .SAR archive file aimed at being decompressed
using the SAPCAR tool, or mount a rogue SAP server offering Dispatcher and entice users to connect to this malicious
server using SAP GUI.

7.3.3. Man-in-the-middle attacks

As most of the services affected by these issues are not encrypted by default, an attacker might be able to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack and trigger the vulnerabilities by injecting malicious packets within the communication.

7.4. Looking in binaries for compression routines

The LZC and LZH compression algorithm routines are statically compiled in the different binaries of the affected
products and programs. It's possible to check if a binary includes these functions by looking at whether the
algorithm's constants are used in the program.

The following Radare [14] command can be used to check if a binary file includes the mentioned constants:

$ rafind2 -x fffefcf8f0e0c080 -x 0103070f1f3f7fff <binary_file>

Example output:

$ rafind2 -X -x fffefcf8f0e0c080 -x 0103070f1f3f7fff SAPCAR64

SAPCAR64: 000 @ 0x1082c1
   offset    0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF
