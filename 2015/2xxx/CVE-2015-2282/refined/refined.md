Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Thomas (LZC) adaptive dictionary compression algorithm within SAP products. Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs during the decompression process.

**Vulnerability:**

-   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2015-2282):** The `CsDecomprLZC` function, responsible for LZC decompression, uses a stack buffer to store output characters in reverse order. The `code` variable, which is attacker-controlled, is used in a `while` loop. If the `code` value is greater than or equal to 256, the `TAB_SUFFIXOF(code)` is written to the stack and `code` is set to `TAB_PREFIXOF(code)`. If values in the prefix and suffix tables are also greater than 256, it allows an attacker to fill the stack with arbitrary values, leading to a stack overflow. Although a macro called `OVERFLOW_CHECK` is present to perform bound checks, it is insufficient to prevent the vulnerability and is often disabled during compilation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code by overflowing the stack.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can also lead to the termination of the vulnerable service, impacting business processes, causing downtime and damaging business reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Server-side attacks:** An attacker can send specially crafted compressed packets to SAP NetWeaver services (e.g., Dispatcher, Gateway) to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Client-side attacks:** An attacker can deliver malicious `.CAR` or `.SAR` archive files, which, when decompressed, can execute code on the client's host. A rogue SAP server can also be set up to entice users to connect using SAP GUI.
-   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks:** Due to the lack of default encryption in affected services, an attacker can inject malicious packets during communication and trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests or inject packets.
-   **Knowledge of the vulnerable protocol and data formats:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specially crafted packets or files that trigger the vulnerability when decompressed.
-   **For client-side attack:** Ability to send malicious files to users, or create malicious server to connect to.

**Affected Products:**

-   SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP
-   SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java
-   SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK
-   SAP RFC SDK
-   SAP GUI
-   SAP MaxDB database
-   SAPCAR archive tool
-   Other SAP products that use the LZC compression algorithm.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The advisory also mentions another vulnerability, CVE-2015-2278, which is an out-of-bounds read in the LZH decompression algorithm.
-   The provided content includes the vulnerable code snippets from the MaxDB source code.
-   The advisory suggests a way to identify vulnerable binaries by searching for specific constants in the binary code using `radare2`.
-   The vulnerability is triggered during the decompression process of the LZC algorithm.
