Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2456:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of TrueType fonts by the Windows DirectWrite library and other components like .NET Framework, Office, Lync, and Silverlight. Specifically, a pool-based buffer overflow occurs during font processing.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered at various locations in the `win32k!scl_ApplyTranslation` function.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper memory allocation and handling while parsing TrueType fonts. This leads to writing data outside the intended buffer boundaries.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The overflow can overwrite function pointers within a font's `fnt_GlobalGraphicStateType` structure.
*   **Incorrect Memory Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by the `add dword ptr [edi+eax*4],edx` instruction which reads or writes to invalid system memory addresses.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Kernel Crash:** The vulnerability can lead to kernel crashes, particularly when Special Pools are enabled for `win32k.sys`.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Overwriting function pointers can lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Documents:** Attackers can embed malicious TrueType fonts within documents (e.g., Word, PDF) and trick users into opening them.
*   **Compromised Webpages:** Attackers can embed malicious TrueType fonts on untrusted webpages that users visit.
*   **Font Manipulation:** Malformed font files with specific mutations in the "maxp" and "hmtx" tables can trigger the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious font (either by opening a document or visiting a webpage).
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted font file with malformed data.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication.
*   **Vulnerable System:** The target system must be running a vulnerable version of Windows, .NET Framework, Office, Lync, or Silverlight.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Microsoft products, making it a widespread threat.
*   The exploit can lead to a "pool-based buffer overflow" in the Windows kernel, highlighting the severity of the issue.
*   The vulnerability can cause both direct crashes and memory corruption that can subsequently lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.
*   The provided content from exploit-db includes specific crash details and stack traces, confirming the vulnerability and the overflow in `win32k!scl_ApplyTranslation` function. It also mentions that sometimes the function pointer located in `fnt_GlobalGraphicStateType` is overwritten, leading to invalid EIPs.
