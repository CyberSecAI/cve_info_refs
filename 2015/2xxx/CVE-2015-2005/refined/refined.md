- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM does not enforce session expiry by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to enforce session expiration leads to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could gain access to sensitive information from a previous user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine where the IBM QRadar SIEM is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the machine where a previous user had an active session in the QRadar SIEM interface.
