Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2747 (based on the content provided, the vulnerability is related to Websense Data Security DLP and the description matches the content provided)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper encoding of user-controllable data when rendered in the Forensics Preview Tab of Websense Data Security DLP. Specifically, the application does not sanitize HTML content present in email bodies or HTTP requests, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. This occurs because the application directly renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization in the Forensics Preview Tab.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the output of the application. When an authenticated user (administrator or auditor) views the affected DLP incident, this malicious code executes in the user's browser. This could lead to:

*   Stealing session tokens.
*   Stealing login credentials.
*   Performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim.
*   Logging victims' keystrokes.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through two primary vectors:

1.  **Specially Crafted Emails:** An attacker sends an email message with malicious HTML in its body. This email triggers a DLP policy, and when the incident is viewed in the Forensics Preview Tab, the malicious HTML is executed in the victim's browser.
2.  **Specially Crafted HTTP Requests:** An attacker sends a malicious HTTP request through the Websense proxy. This request contains a Cross-Site Scripting payload that triggers a Web DLP policy. When the resulting incident is viewed, the payload is executed in the victimâ€™s browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send an email or HTTP request that will be processed by Websense Data Security DLP, triggering a relevant DLP policy.
*   The attacker does not need to have administrative access to the Websense system itself but must be able to trigger a data loss prevention (DLP) event.
*   The attacker's payload executes when an authorized user (admin or auditor) views the details of the triggered DLP incident in the Forensics Preview Tab within the Websense application.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability was discovered on Websense Triton v7.8.3 and Websense appliance modules V-Series v7.7. Other versions may be affected as well.
*   **Fix:** A workaround was provided that involves securing forensics with plain text rendering. A permanent fix was scheduled for Websense TRITON APX version 8.1.
*   The provided advisory from securify.nl includes example proof of concept code demonstrating the injection of JavaScript via email and an HTTP request.
