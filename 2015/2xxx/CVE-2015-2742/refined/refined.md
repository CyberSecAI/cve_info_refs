  "CVE-2015-2742": {
    "Description": "Mozilla developer David Parks discovered while reviewing Firefox crash reports that personal data can sometimes be contained in reports from OS X systems. This is because these OS X crash reports will contain the native key that triggered the crash and this can sometimes contain key press information that was being entered when the crash occurred. This issue does not affect Linux or Windows installations of Firefox.",
    "Root cause": "The OS X crash reports included the native key that triggered the crash which can expose key press information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (key press data) in crash reports."
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive information (key press data) to individuals reviewing crash reports.",
    "Attack vectors": "Not applicable, this is an information leak, not an exploitable vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Not applicable. The issue is that the information is included in the crash report itself."
