Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `cpanel` function of the `go_site.php` file. User-supplied parameters, specifically `$action` and `$type`, are directly passed to the PHP `exec` function without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided inputs before they are used in the `exec` function.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerable code directly uses user input to construct a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server process, which can include root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By injecting malicious commands, an attacker could gain full control over the affected system, including the underlying database and infrastructure.
*   **Reverse Shell:** A common attack vector is to execute a reverse shell, allowing the attacker persistent access to the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `cpanel` function in `go_site.php`, by manipulating the $type and/or $action parameters
*   **Base64 Encoding:** The exploit may use base64 encoding to bypass web server encoding and inject commands into the vulnerable `exec` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable GoAutoDial instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URI and parameters (`/index.php/go_site/cpanel/$type/$action`) in order to inject commands.
