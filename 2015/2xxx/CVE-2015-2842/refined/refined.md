  "CVE-2015-2842": {
    "Root cause": "Improper file extension check in the 'audiostore' upload functionality.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The application does not properly validate filename extensions during file uploads, allowing files with double extensions (e.g., 'bogus.wav.php') to bypass checks."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file upload and remote code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Uploading a file with a malicious double extension through the 'audiostore' functionality."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to upload files to the application's 'audiostore' functionality.",
      "Ability to access the uploaded file via browser."
    ],
     "Additional Details": "The uploaded file is moved to a symlinked directory (/var/lib/asterisk/sounds) that is accessible directly from the browser."
  }
