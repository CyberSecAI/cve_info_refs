Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-2546:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the `win32k.sys` driver. Specifically, the driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory corruption vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver (`win32k.sys`).
*   Improper handling of objects in memory leading to the corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Elevation of privilege. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining full control of the affected system. This allows them to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to first log on to the system.
*   Then, they would execute a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker requires valid logon credentials to the target system.
*   They must be able to execute an arbitrary application on the system.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-097.
*   The affected software includes various versions of Windows.
*   The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed and had been exploited at the time the security bulletin was issued.
