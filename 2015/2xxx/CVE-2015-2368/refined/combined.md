## Vulnerabilities in Windows Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3072631)

Published: July 14, 2015 | Updated: July 29, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow Remote Code Execution if an attacker first places a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file in the target userâs current working directory and then convinces the user to open an RTF file or to launch a program that is designed to load a trusted DLL file but instead loads the attackerâs specially crafted DLL file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003 (excluding Itanium), Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 (excluding Itanium), Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 (excluding Itanium), Windows 8.1, Windows 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows loads certain DLL files and how Windows Media Device Manager loads certain binaries. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3072631](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3072631).

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows DLL Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2368

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows improperly handles the loading of dynamic link library (DLL) files. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target userâs current working directory and then convince the user to launch a program that is designed to load a trusted DLL file but instead loads the attackerâs specially crafted DLL file. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles the loading of certain DLL files.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## DLL Planting Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2369

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows Media Device Manager improperly handles the loading of certain specially crafted DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target userâs current working directory and then convince the user to open a specially crafted .RTF file. The attacker would have no way to force users to open the file. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Media Device Manager loads certain binaries.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

**Modify the Registry to prevent Office documents from loading the WMDMCESP.WMDMCESP ActiveX control**

**Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Create a text file named **WMDMCESP-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{067B4B81-B1EC-489f-B111-940EBDC44EBE}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

```

2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu, and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **WMDMCESP-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
   (**Note:** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

**Impact of workaround.** Documents that use the WMDMCESP.WMDMCESP ActiveX control may not work properly.

**How to undo the workaround.**

1. Create a text file named **WMDMCESP-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM Compatibility\{067B4B81-B1EC-489f-B111-940EBDC44EBE}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000000

```

2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu, and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **WMDMCESP-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
   (**Note:** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

## Revisions

* V1.0 (July 14, 2015): Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (July 29, 2015): Bulletin revised to correct the Desktop Experience footnote in the Affected Software section. The footnote had incorrectly applied to update 3070738 on Windows Server 2008 R2 when it should have applied to update 3067903 on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Also added a footnote for the 3070738 update to clarify that only systems with RDP 8.1 installed are affected. These are informational changes only. Customers who have already successfully applied the updates do not need to take any action. Customers who have not already installed the necessary updates should do so to be protected from the vulnerability it addresses.
