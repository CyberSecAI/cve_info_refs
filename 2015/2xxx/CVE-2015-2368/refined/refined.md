- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of the loading of dynamic link library (DLL) files by Microsoft Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in how Windows loads certain DLL files, which allows an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL for a legitimate one.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights. This leads to Remote Code Execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1.  The attacker needs to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target user's current working directory.
    2. The attacker then needs to convince the user to launch a program that is designed to load a trusted DLL but instead loads the attacker's malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a file in the user's current working directory and to trick the user into executing a program that would load the malicious DLL.
