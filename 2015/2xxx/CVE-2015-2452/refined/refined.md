{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view it. They could also inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant message or email, or to open a malicious email attachment. The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious content."
