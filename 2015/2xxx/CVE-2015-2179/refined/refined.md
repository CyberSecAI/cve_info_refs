Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `execute` function in the `dm-rails/storage.rb` file of the `xaviershay-dm-rails` gem handles database credentials. Specifically, it constructs a system command using the `mysql` command-line client and directly passes the username and password as command-line arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Exposure:** The most significant weakness is the exposure of database credentials (username and password) via the process table. When the `system` command is executed, the arguments, including the username and password, are visible in the process list (e.g., when using `ps -ef`). This allows any user with sufficient privileges to view the credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** An attacker who obtains the database credentials could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local System Access:** An attacker would need local system access to view the process list. This could be achieved by an attacker who has shell access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute system commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running.
- The attacker needs to be able to view the process table through commands like `ps -ef`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-rails/storage.rb`
- The vulnerability exists in the `execute` function lines 169-177.
- The `system` function is used to execute the `mysql` client command, and the credentials are passed as command-line options.
- The provided exploit code `while (true) do ps -ef |grep [p]assword; done` can be used to continuously monitor the process table and capture any occurrences of the password being passed as a command-line argument.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory also includes vendor notification details and a reference to the CVE entry on mitre.org
