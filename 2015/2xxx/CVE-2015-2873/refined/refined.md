Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2873:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Trend Micro Deep Discovery Threat Appliance does not properly check authorization for several URLs, including those for system logs, whitelists, and blacklists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**: Several URLs are accessible to a non-administrator user by direct request. The application fails to enforce proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user without administrator privileges may access and modify certain system configuration settings. This could lead to unauthorized changes in the system configuration, possibly disrupting the appliance's operations, exfiltrating sensitive information and/or circumventing security controls.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct request to specific URLs (e.g., system log, whitelist, blacklist pages) by an authenticated user who lacks administrator privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Trend Micro Deep Discovery appliance. They do not require administrator privileges.
