## Vulnerability Information

## Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Netlogon - CVE-2015-2374

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Netlogon that is caused when the service improperly establishes a secure communications channel to a primary domain controller (PDC). To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first need to have access to a PDC on a target network. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could establish a secure channel to the PDC as a replica domain controller and may be able to disclose credentials. Servers configured as domain controllers are at risk from this vulnerability. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Netlogon handles establishing secure channels.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
