- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the Netlogon service improperly establishes a secure communications channel to a primary domain controller (PDC).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper establishment of secure channel in Netlogon service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially elevate privileges and possibly disclose credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a primary domain controller (PDC) on a target network can exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application that establishes a secure channel to the PDC as a replica domain controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) on the target network and be able to run a specially crafted application.
