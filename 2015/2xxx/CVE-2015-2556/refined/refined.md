Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2556:

**CVE-2015-2556: Microsoft SharePoint Information Disclosure Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from SharePoint InfoPath Forms Services improperly parsing the Document Type Definition (DTD) of an XML file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure issue.  SharePoint's improper handling of DTD entities allows an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to browse the contents of arbitrary files on a SharePoint server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, or other confidential information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs write permissions to a SharePoint site.
    *   InfoPath Services must be enabled on the SharePoint server.
    *   The attacker uploads a specially crafted XML file to a web page, and then sends a specially crafted web request to the SharePoint server. This crafted request triggers the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with write permissions on a SharePoint site.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the SharePoint server.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the SharePoint server.
