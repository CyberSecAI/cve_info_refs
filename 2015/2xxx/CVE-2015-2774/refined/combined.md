# [ImperialViolet](https://www.imperialviolet.org)

### [The POODLE bites again](/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html) (08 Dec 2014)

October's [POODLE attack](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html) affected CBC-mode cipher suites in SSLv3 due to SSLv3's under-specification of the contents of the CBC padding bytes. Since SSLv3 didn't say what the padding bytes should be, implementations couldn't check them and that opened SSLv3 up to an oracle attack.

We're done pretty well at killing off SSLv3 in response to that. Chrome 39 (released Nov 18th) removed fallback to SSLv3 and Chrome 40 [is scheduled](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/security-dev/Vnhy9aKM_l4) to remove SSLv3 completely. Firefox 34 (released Dec 1st) has already [removed SSLv3 support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/34.0/releasenotes/).

We're removing SSLv3 in favour of TLS because TLS fully specifies the contents of the padding bytes and thus stops the attack. However, TLS's padding is a *subset* of SSLv3's padding so, technically, you could use an SSLv3 decoding function with TLS and it would still work fine. It wouldn't check the padding bytes but that wouldn't cause any problems in normal operation. However, if an SSLv3 decoding function was used with TLS, then the POODLE attack would work, even against TLS connections.

This was noted by, at least, Brian Smith on the TLS list ([[1](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14058.html)][[2](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14072.html)]) and I was sufficiently cynical to assume that there were probably more instances of this than the old versions of NSS that Brian cited, and so wrote a scanner for the issue.

Unfortunately, I found a number of major sites that had this problem. At least one of whom I had good enough contacts at to quickly find that they used an F5 device to terminate connections. I contacted F5 on October 21st and they started working on a fix. Yngve Pettersen also [independently found](https://vivaldi.net/blogs/entry/not-out-of-the-woods-yet-there-are-more-poodles) this issue and contacted me about it around this time.

F5 reported that some of the affected sites weren't customers of theirs, which meant that there was (at least) a second vendor with the same issue. After more digging, I found that some A10 devices also have this problem. I emailed a number of contacts at A10 on October 30th but sadly didn't get a reply from any of them. It wasn't until November 13th that I found the right person at A10 to deal with this.

F5 and A10 have posted patches for their products (F5's are [here](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/15000/800/sol15882.html) and A10's are [here](https://www.a10networks.com/support-axseries/downloads/downloads.php) and they have an advisory [here](https://www.a10networks.com/support/advisories/A10-RapidResponse_CVE-2014-8730.pdf)). I'm not completely sure that I've found every affected vendor but, now that this issue is public, any other affected products should quickly come to light. (Citrix devices have an odd behaviour in this area in that they'll accept padding bytes that are all zeros, but not random padding. That's unexpected but I can't make an attack out of it.)

(**Update**: since posting this, it appears that products from Fortinet, [Cisco](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2014-8730), IBM ([WebSphere](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692552), [Domino](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21693142), [Tivoli](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692802)) and [Juniper](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=TSB16579&actp=RSS) may also be affected.)

Ivan Ristić has added a test for this issue to his excellent scanner at [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). Affected sites will have their grade set to F and will report “This server is vulnerable to the POODLE attack against TLS servers”.

This seems like a good moment to reiterate that *everything* less than TLS 1.2 with an AEAD cipher suite is cryptographically broken. An IETF [draft to prohibit RC4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4/) is in Last Call at the moment but it would be wrong to believe that RC4 is uniquely bad. While RC4 is fundamentally broken and no implementation can save it, attacks against MtE-CBC ciphers have repeatedly been shown to be far more practical. Thankfully, TLS 1.2 support is [about to hit](https://www.trustworthyinternet.org/ssl-pulse/) 50% at the time of writing.

### NEWS

[ANN] Erlang/OTP 18.0-rc1 is available for testing.

*Written by [Kenneth](/web/20150905124006/http%3A//www.erlang.org/news/user/Kenneth), 26 Mar 2015*

## Erlang/OTP 18.0-rc1 is available for testing.

This is an alpha release, which will be followed by a planned beta release in May and a final OTP 18.0 product release in June 2015.

Between the alpha and beta and final release there will be new updates of the master branch with corrections and minor new features. Occasionally there might be new tags which we in that case will communicate and ask you to test.

Erlang/OTP 18.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as a few incompatibilities.

See the Release Notes and the documentation for more details.

We would like to ask you to build and test the alpha release and send us your feedback as soon as possible, so that we can make the necessary corrections before OTP 18.0-rc2 and OTP 18.0, respectively.

The release contains many changes; thus, some unexpected incompatibilities or issues may have slipped through our tests. Please try to build and run your current products/applications and let us know about any problems.

**IMPORTANT INFO when building your own code with this OTP release**

Since erlang:now is deprecated your build might stop if you are using "warnings as errors".

To let the build through you can turn of warnings for deprecated functions by setting an environment variable like this:

export ERL\_COMPILER\_OPTIONS=nowarn\_deprecated\_function

Some highlights of the release are:

* dialyzer: The -dialyzer() attribute can be used for suppressing warnings in a module by specifying functions or warning options. It can also be used for requesting warnings in a module.
* erts: The time functionality has been extended. This includes a new API for time, as well as "time warp" modes which alters the behavior when system time changes. You are strongly encouraged to use the new API instead of the old API based on erlang:now/0. erlang:now/0 has been deprecated since it will always be a scalability bottleneck. For more information see the Time and Time Correction chapter of the ERTS User's Guide. Here is a link [http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/erts-7.0/doc/html/time\_correction.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905124006/http%3A//www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-7.0-rc1/erts-7.0/doc/html/time_correction.html)
* erts: Beside the API changes and time warp modes a lot of scalability and performance improvements regarding time management has been made. Examples are:
  + scheduler specific timer wheels,
  + scheduler specific BIF timer management,
  + parallel retrieval of monotonic time and system time on OS:es that support it.
* erts: The previously introduced "eager check I/O" feature is now enabled by default.
* erts/compiler: enhanced support for maps. Big maps new uses a HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie) representation internally which makes them more efficient. There is now also support for variables as map keys.
* ssl: Remove default support for SSL-3.0 and added padding check for TLS-1.0 due to the Poodle vulnerability.
* ssl: Remove default support for RC4 cipher suites, as they are consider too weak.
* stdlib: Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs

You can find the Release Notes with more detailed info at [http://www.erlang.org/download/otp18rc1\_relnotes.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905124006/http%3A//www.erlang.org/download/otp18rc1_relnotes.pdf)

You find the source code at github.com in the official Erlang repository.

Git tag OTP-18.0-rc1

[https://github.com/erlang/otp/tree/OTP-18.0-rc1](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905124006/https%3A//github.com/erlang/otp/tree/OTP-18.0-rc1)

You can also read the documentation on-line here: (see the Release Notes mentioned above for release notes which are not updated in the doc, but the new functionality is)

Subject: CVE request: Erlang POODLE TLS vulnerability

Hi,

From the release notes of Erlang 18.0-rc1:
<http://www.erlang.org/news/85>
"ssl: Remove default support for SSL-3.0 and added padding check for
TLS-1.0 due to the Poodle vulnerability."

This indicates that Erlang was vulnerable to the TLS-variant of the
poodle vulnerability due to missing padding checks (see [1]).

While disabling old protocols is maybe not something covered by CVEs,
this clearly is an implementation error and thus should be considered a
vuln.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
