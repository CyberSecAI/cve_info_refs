Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Quassel, an IRC client, splits messages that are too long to be sent in a single IRC message. The old code used a recursive approach that could lead to a stack overflow, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  Specifically, the issue occurred when the message contained multibyte characters. The old code used byte indices, while the splitting logic required character indices. The new code uses QTextBoundaryFinder which splits on character and word boundaries to avoid the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Recursion:** The old message splitting algorithm was recursive, potentially leading to stack exhaustion when processing very long messages.
*   **Incorrect String Handling**: The old code split strings based on byte indices instead of character indices. This was problematic when dealing with multibyte characters since a split could happen in the middle of the character sequence, potentially causing the message to be misinterpreted or cause a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful attack would cause the Quassel core to crash or hang due to a stack overflow or other error. This would disrupt service for all connected clients.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted CTCP Queries:** An attacker could send an overlength CTCP query containing only multibyte characters to trigger the vulnerability in the old code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a connected and authenticated user of the Quassel core to send the crafted messages.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is addressed in commit `b5e38970ffd55e2dd9f706ce75af9a8d7730b1b8`, which replaced the old recursive algorithm with one based on QTextBoundaryFinder. This new algorithm is iterative, non-recursive, and splits on character boundaries instead of byte boundaries.
*   The fix also includes a fallback to grapheme boundaries if word boundaries cannot be found for splitting. The new code also gracefully gives up instead of crashing if it's unable to split a string.
*  The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 0.12-rc1.
*  The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
