Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit 5b77de6ea77e0eff2aa726d9722d64fb4964b985 in the `kzar/watchadblock` repository:

**Vulnerability:**

The commit includes a fix for an issue where the request URL didn't contain a ".". This indicates a potential vulnerability related to how the AdBlock extension was processing URLs, especially when trying to determine the type of resource being requested.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability was a flaw in the logic for determining resource types based on the URL. Specifically, the code was using the last occurrence of a "." in the URL's pathname to extract the file extension. If a URL did not contain any ".", the code would not handle it and potentially misclassify or fail to process the resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

The primary weakness was the lack of proper handling for URLs without a ".". This could lead to:
*   Incorrect categorization of resources (e.g., treating an image as an object)
*   Potential bypass of the ad-blocking rules if the resource type is misidentified.
*   Unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker might be able to bypass the ad blocker if they use URLs without the "." or exploit the misclassification of the resource.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector would involve a webpage using URLs for resources that do not include any ".".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker would need to be able to serve content through URLs that do not contain a ".". The attacker would likely be the operator of the webpage which includes the malicious resources.

**Technical Details:**

The commit includes the following change in `src/background.js` that addresses the issue:

This change ensures that if there is not a '.' character in the URL path, then a default type is returned, instead of trying to perform substring operations on the '.' which don't exist in the URL path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This commit also includes other changes, such as removing the Norwegian filter list, adding last update timestamps to subscribed filter lists, adding malware notification settings to debug data, and other minor UI fixes. However, the most relevant change to a potential vulnerability is the URL processing fix.
* The code changes also include the addition of a user confirmation prompt when subscribing to a new filter lists using the ABP syntax.
