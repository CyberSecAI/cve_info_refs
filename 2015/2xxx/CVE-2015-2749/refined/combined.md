Hash: SHA1

>> Open redirect (Several vectors including the "destination" URL
>> parameter - Drupal 6 and 7)

We feel that, for purposes of CVE, this is best represented as two
distinct problems.

First, "destination" is essentially a reserved keyword, and both
Drupal 6 and 7 lacked pre-processing of the original input to
eliminate unintended uses of this keyword. As mentioned on the
<https://www.drupal.org/node/2455007> page, 'Many areas of Drupal use a
"destination" query string parameter for built-in redirect
functionality.' Because "destination" was intended only for this
"built-in" use, we feel that it is roughly like a Technology-Specific
Special Element in the <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/169.html>
sense.

Use CVE-2015-2749.

> That issue affected differently to
> distinct Drupal versions; for example all confirmation forms in Drupal
> 7 could be redirected to an external page via the 'destination'
> parameter directly, but in Drupal 6 only if the code that builds the
> confirmation form uses the parameter (and there are only a few).
> The destination parameter was being trusted in multiple places

We do not feel that this difference between 6 and 7 requires separate
CVE IDs.

Second, there were these separate changes:

> <http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/commit/includes/menu.inc?h=6.x&id=8ffc5db3c0ab926f3d4b2cf8bc51714c8c0f3c93>
> <http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/commit/includes/common.inc?h=7.x&id=b44056d2f8e8c71d35c85ec5c2fb8f7c8a02d8a8>

Here, the underlying problem is lack of checks for the special "//"
initial sequence, which is associated with an external resource. This
is roughly like an Input Leader in the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/148.html> sense. Because of the
code reorganization between 6 and 7, the code changes are not
identical but apparently the goal is to prevent only the "//" attack
approach, not other attack approaches. Accordingly, it can be
considered the same problem, and the same CVE ID is applicable to both
6 and 7.

Use CVE-2015-2750.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204753#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-23 13:05:43 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in Drupal:  Drupal core and contributed modules frequently use a "destination" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.  In addition, several URL-related API functions in Drupal 6 and 7 can be tricked into passing through external URLs when not intending to, potentially leading to additional open redirect vulnerabilities.  This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that many common uses of the "destination" parameter are not susceptible to the attack. However, all confirmation forms built using Drupal 7's form API are vulnerable via the Cancel action that appears at the bottom of the form, and some Drupal 6 confirmation forms are vulnerable too.
