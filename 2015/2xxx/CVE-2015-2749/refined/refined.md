Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the "destination" query string parameter in Drupal 6 and 7. This parameter is used for redirecting users after completing an action. The core issue is that the application was not processing the original input to eliminate unintended uses of the "destination" keyword, leading to potential misuse.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. By manipulating the "destination" parameter, an attacker could redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system lacked sufficient checks and preprocessing of the "destination" parameter. This allowed attackers to inject malicious URLs into the parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Social Engineering Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.
*   **Reputation Damage:** If exploited, this vulnerability could damage the reputation of websites using the vulnerable Drupal versions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** Attackers construct malicious URLs containing the "destination" parameter pointing to their chosen external site.
*   **User Interaction:** Attackers trick users into clicking on these manipulated links through various methods (e.g., email, social media, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with the vulnerable "destination" parameter.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs a way to entice the victim to click on the crafted malicious URL. This could be through phishing emails, social media posts, or other forms of social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in both Drupal 6 and 7, with some differences in how easily it could be exploited in various parts of the system.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a "Technology-Specific Special Element," where the "destination" parameter was intended for a specific internal use but lacked proper restrictions.
*   The fix for this issue was included in Drupal 6.35 and 7.35, as well as various Linux distribution updates.

This vulnerability is related to open redirects through the "destination" query parameter, and CVE-2015-2750 relates to open redirects through "//" initial sequence in URLs, thus this content is relevant to CVE-2015-2749.
