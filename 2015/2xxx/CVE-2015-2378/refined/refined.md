  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Excel improperly handles the loading of dynamic link library (DLL) files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of DLL loading"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. The attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target userâ€™s current working directory.",
      "The attacker needs to convince the user to launch a program that loads a trusted DLL but mistakenly loads the attacker's malicious DLL instead."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the victim's application will load it and also convince the user to execute an application that triggers the loading of the malicious DLL."
