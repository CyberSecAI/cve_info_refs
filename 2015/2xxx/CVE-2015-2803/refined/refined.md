Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the TYPO3 extension "Akronymmanager". The extension's `mod1/index.php` file uses a user-supplied HTTP GET parameter ('id') directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Leakage: An attacker can read sensitive data from the TYPO3 database, including user credentials (usernames and password hashes).
- Privilege Escalation: By obtaining user credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, leading to privilege escalation.
- Potential Command Execution: Depending on the database configuration, it might be possible to execute arbitrary commands on the database host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameter: The attack is carried out by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL used to access the `mod1/index.php` file of the TYPO3 extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated backend user: The attacker must have access to the backend part of the TYPO3 Akronymmanager extension, implying they need to be an authenticated backend user.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `mod1/index.php` is:
```php
$pageID = t3lib_div::_GET("id");
if ($pageID) $where = "uid='$pageID' AND ";
$result = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTquery('title,uid', 'pages',
    $where.'hidden="0" AND deleted="0"','sorting');
```
- A sample exploit URL is provided:
```
http://www.example.org/typo3conf/ext/sb_akronymmanager/mod1/index.php?id=379%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20(SELECT%20group_concat(username,%27:%27,password)%20FROM%20be_users),2%20--%20
```
This URL injects a SQL UNION statement to extract usernames and password hashes from the `be_users` table.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected versions of the extension are <=0.5.0
- Fixed version is 7.0.0
- The vulnerability is rated as a medium security risk.
