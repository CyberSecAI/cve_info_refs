  "CVE-2015-2741": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird before 38.1 do not enforce key pinning upon encountering an X.509 certificate problem that generates a user dialog, which allows user-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by triggering a (1) expired certificate or (2) mismatched hostname for a domain with pinning enabled.",
    "root_cause": "The applications do not enforce key pinning when an X.509 certificate problem arises that prompts a user dialog.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of key pinning"
    ],
    "impact": "User-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers can bypass intended access restrictions for pinned domains.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "User interaction"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Man-in-the-middle position on the network",
        "Ability to present a (1) expired certificate or (2) a mismatched hostname"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability requires user interaction to accept/bypass the certificate errors. This issue does not allow third parties to cause a certificate to be overridden."
