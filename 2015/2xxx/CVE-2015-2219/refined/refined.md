The provided content includes information about CVE-2015-2219.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Lenovo System Update service (SUService.exe) uses a predictable security token for authenticating commands sent via a named pipe from the unprivileged System Update client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Predictable security token: The token used for authenticating commands sent to the privileged service can be easily generated by any user without requiring elevated permissions.
- Insecure inter-process communication: The communication between the unprivileged System Update and the privileged service relies on a named pipe with inadequate authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation: An unprivileged user can send arbitrary commands to the privileged service, which will be executed as the SYSTEM user, effectively gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine to exploit the vulnerability.
- Named pipe communication: The attacker sends commands with a generated, but predictable, security token through the named pipe to the privileged SUService.exe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user of the machine and have the ability to interact with the named pipe. No elevated privileges are required for the attack to be performed.
