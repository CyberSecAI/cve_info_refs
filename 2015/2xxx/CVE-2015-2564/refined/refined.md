Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2564

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `client-edit.php` file of ProjectSend r561.
*   The `id` parameter passed through the GET request is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly embeds user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization. Although the code uses `mysql_real_escape_string`, this function is used on a check with `client_exists_id()` and not on the vulnerable `SELECT` query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails, other user information).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system depending on database permissions and application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted GET request to `client-edit.php`.
*   The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ProjectSend application.
*   No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement for exploiting this specific vulnerability, but access to the users-edit.php page is needed.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
*   The attacker does not need to have prior access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
