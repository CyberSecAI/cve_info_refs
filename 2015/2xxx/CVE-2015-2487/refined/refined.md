*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They could also leverage compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content by injecting malicious content. The attacker must convince the user to view the malicious content (e.g., through a link or by opening a malicious attachment).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to access that content via Internet Explorer.
