{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Windows when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerabilities are caused by how Windows Journal parses Journal files.",
     "Specially crafted journal file can cause arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Journal file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. In an email attack scenario, this could be done via malicious attachment.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Journal file, deliver it to the target user, and convince them to open it."
