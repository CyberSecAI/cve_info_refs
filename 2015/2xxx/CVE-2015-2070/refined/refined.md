Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Time-based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability arises from improper handling of user-supplied input within the `catId` parameter of the `/cm/blogrss/feed` servlet. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code, specifically time-based blind SQL injection.

*   **Arbitrary File Read:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `filepath` parameter of the `/cm/newui/blog/export.jsp` endpoint, allowing an authenticated user to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `/cm/blogrss/feed` servlet is vulnerable to unauthenticated time-based SQL injection. The application does not sanitize the `catId` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The `/cm/newui/blog/export.jsp` endpoint is vulnerable to arbitrary file read. The application does not sanitize the `filepath` parameter and allows directory traversal using `../`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, table structure, and data.
    *   The attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:**
    *   An attacker can read sensitive configuration files like `cm.xml`, which contains database credentials.
    *   This could lead to further compromise of the system by using the obtained credentials to access the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cm/blogrss/feed` servlet with a malicious `catId` parameter.
    *   The exploitation is through the web interface of the application.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:**
    *   The attacker must first create an account on the system (easy to do through the sign-up page).
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/cm/newui/blog/export.jsp` with a malicious `filepath` parameter.
    *   The exploitation is through the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable eTouch SamePage application.
    *   No prior authentication is needed.
*    **Arbitrary File Read:**
     *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable eTouch SamePage application.
     *   The attacker needs to be able to create an account through the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes successful exploitation examples using `sqlmap` for SQL injection and crafted HTTP requests for arbitrary file read.
*   The vulnerable software is identified as eTouch SamePage v4.4.0.0.239
*   The web application is identified as using JSP and the back-end DBMS as MySQL.
