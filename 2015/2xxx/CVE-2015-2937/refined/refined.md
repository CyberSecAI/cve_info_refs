Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's use of `xml_parse` to process XML data, specifically when the data is buffered (as done in `XmlTypeCheck` and `XMPReader`). When processing XML with many nested entities, the expansion of these entities can lead to a "quadratic blowup." This occurs because the parser keeps expanding the entities in the XML body, which can exhaust memory up to PHP's configured `memory_limit`.  If the memory limit is not set low enough, the PHP process may encounter a string length limit overflow, or if there's ample memory, zend will bail with a heap corruption error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Entity Expansion:** The core issue is that `xml_parse` does not limit entity expansion, leading to a denial of service due to excessive resource consumption (memory, CPU).
*   **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** When processing a maliciously crafted XML document with many entities the XML parser will expand these entities which leads to uncontrolled memory allocation.
*   **Lack of Resource Limits:** Insufficient checks and enforcement of memory limits and max execution time during XML parsing, mainly when handling user-provided data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS, where an attacker can cause the MediaWiki server to become unresponsive by exhausting its resources. This can result in the service being unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The attack causes excessive memory consumption, potentially leading to a server crash or performance degradation.
*   **CPU Exhaustion:** The excessive processing also utilizes CPU resources, exacerbating the DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a crafted SVG file or any file containing XMP metadata that includes a malicious doctype declaration with deeply nested entities.
*   **XML Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the MediaWiki software parses the malicious XML content using `xml_parse`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the MediaWiki server.
*   **Malicious XML Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a specially crafted XML document with deeply nested entities.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** There's no indication that the vulnerability requires authenticated access, so it could be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details (From Phabricator):**

*   **HHVM and Zend PHP Affected:** The vulnerability affects both HHVM and Zend PHP environments, though the method of exploitation and the specific error might vary.
*   **String Overflow and Heap Corruption:** Under certain circumstances, the string growth can overflow the string length limit, and if there is still sufficient available memory, zend may bail with zend\_mm\_heap corrupted.
*   **Fix:** The fix involved the introduction of a `SafeXmlParser` class to handle XML parsing more securely. It limits entity expansion by using `XMLReader` instead of `xml_parse` whenever possible, particularly when parsing XMP metadata and checking XML file types.
*   **Workaround:** In situations where XML parsing must be done with `xml_parse`, the code checks for the presence of a DOCTYPE declaration and aborts if one is detected.

In short, CVE-2015-2937 is a DoS vulnerability caused by unbounded entity expansion during XML parsing within MediaWiki, exploitable by uploading crafted XML documents.
