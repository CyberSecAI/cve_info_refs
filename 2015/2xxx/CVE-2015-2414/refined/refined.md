Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2414:

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-2414 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Internet Explorer. It occurs due to improper handling of cached image information, potentially allowing an attacker to access information about the user's browsing history.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's improper handling of cached image data, potentially exposing browsing history information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive user data, specifically their browsing history.
*   **Improper Cache Handling:** The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer manages cached image information, which is not correctly secured against unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Browsing History Exposure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to learn about a user's browsing activity. This information can be used for further targeted attacks, social engineering, or other malicious activities.
*   **Limited Direct Impact:** This vulnerability does not directly lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. However, the disclosed information could be used as a stepping stone for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into legitimate websites or advertisements.
*   **User Interaction Required:**  The attacker would have to convince a user to visit the malicious site or view the compromised content.  This could be achieved by social engineering tactics such as sending phishing emails or using other methods that entice the user to click a link leading to the attacker's malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hosting or Compromising a Website:** The attacker needs to control the content of a website.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to visit the malicious site, so they must use social engineering or other methods to get the user to interact with their malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Important" on Windows clients and "Low" on Windows Servers.
*   **Mitigation:** The update addresses the vulnerability by properly enforcing cross-domain policies in Internet Explorer.

In essence, CVE-2015-2414 is an information disclosure vulnerability that, while not providing direct access to system control, can expose sensitive browsing data which could be further exploited. The vulnerability exists in how Internet Explorer manages cached images and is mitigated by correctly implementing cross-domain policies.
