Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-2443:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within Internet Explorer's handling of the accessor function for the stack trace property descriptor. Specifically, the browser fails to validate if the 'this' parameter is an object, and not a native integer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core issue is the improper handling of the 'this' parameter type, leading to a type confusion vulnerability.
*   **Memory Corruption:** This type confusion can result in memory corruption, allowing attackers to potentially overwrite critical data structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains full control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host specially crafted web pages designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, leveraging user traffic to initiate the attack.
*   **Malicious Files:** Opening a malicious file can also trigger this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not require local access to the victim's machine.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs to understand the specific memory corruption vulnerability to craft the exploit.
