Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2191:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) dissector in Wireshark. This dissector is responsible for parsing and interpreting TNEF data, often found in email attachments. A flaw in the dissector's logic can lead to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is that the TNEF dissector can enter an infinite loop when processing specifically crafted or malformed TNEF data. This is due to an error in how the dissector parses attribute values and checksums within the TNEF structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. When Wireshark encounters a crafted TNEF packet/file, the TNEF dissector enters an infinite loop consuming excessive CPU resources and preventing further processing. This effectively makes the software unresponsive and unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Network Packets:** An attacker can inject a malformed TNEF packet onto the network traffic being captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture Files:**  An attacker can trick a user into opening a malformed pcap/pcapng capture file containing malicious TNEF data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access (for live capture):** If exploiting via network packets, the attacker needs to be positioned to send packets to a system running Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering (for capture files):** If exploiting by a malformed capture file, the attacker needs to convince the victim to open the file in Wireshark.
- **Knowledge of TNEF Format:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the TNEF format to craft the malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.10.0 to 1.10.12 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.3 and is fixed in 1.10.13 and 1.12.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vlad Tsyrklevich.
- Some reports suggest this vulnerability is more easily triggered on 32-bit architectures.

The provided documents offer more details than the official CVE description, as they specify the affected versions, provide the technical details of the infinite loop, explain how an attacker could trigger this vulnerability and detail the resolution of the problem.
