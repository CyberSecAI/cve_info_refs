Discovered by Vlad Tsyrklevich. Impact: It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1199167#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-05 14:50:05 UTC  ```  Created wireshark tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1199173](show_bug.cgi?id=1199173 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-2192 CVE-2015-2191 CVE-2015-2190 CVE-2015-2188 CVE-2015-2189 CVE-2015-2187 wireshark: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1199167#c3)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-04-01 10:13:55 UTC  ``` Patch =====  <https://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=patch;h=44a46a1fe55872237e206d6bb4aa046f2797d1ba>  POC ===  <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=13484>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1199167#c4)  Martin Žember    2015-04-23 23:31:37 UTC  ``` Hi Siddharth,  I have troubles with reproducing the issue on RHEL-6. I seem to not meet the code path that is being patched, look:  The vulnerable code is present: (gdb) l packet-tnef.c:624 619			    proto_tree_add_item(attr_tree, hf_tnef_attribute_value, tvb, offset, length, ENC_NA); 620			    break; 621		    } 622	    } 623	 624	    offset += length; 625	 626	    proto_tree_add_item(attr_tree, hf_tnef_attribute_checksum, tvb, offset, 2, ENC_LITTLE_ENDIAN); 627	    offset += 2; 628	  I set a breakpoint there: (gdb) b packet-tnef.c:624 Note: breakpoint 6 (disabled) also set at pc 0x7ffff55a03f8. Breakpoint 7 at 0x7ffff55a03f8: file packet-tnef.c, line 624.  I read the file (renamed to CVE-2015-2191-tnef-dos.pcap) and nothing happens: (gdb) r -nr CVE-2015-2191-tnef-dos.pcap &>/dev/null Starting program: /usr/sbin/tshark -nr CVE-2015-2191-tnef-dos.pcap &>/dev/null [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]  Program exited normally.

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer,
which is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer
network.

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2014-8714, CVE-2014-8712, CVE-2014-8713,
CVE-2014-8711, CVE-2014-8710, CVE-2015-0562, CVE-2015-0564, CVE-2015-2189,
CVE-2015-2191)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the Wireshark tool did not support Advanced Encryption

Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cryptographic algorithm. As a
consequence, AES-GCM was not decrypted. Support for AES-GCM has been added
to Wireshark, and AES-GCM is now correctly decrypted. (BZ#1095065)

* Previously, when installing the system using the kickstart method, a

dependency on the shadow-utils packages was missing from the wireshark
packages, which could cause the installation to fail with a "bad scriptlet"
error message. With this update, shadow-utils are listed as required in the
wireshark packages spec file, and kickstart installation no longer fails.
(BZ#1121275)

* Prior to this update, the Wireshark tool could not decode types of

elliptic curves in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Client Hello.
Consequently, Wireshark incorrectly displayed elliptic curves types as
data. A patch has been applied to address this bug, and Wireshark now
decodes elliptic curves types properly. (BZ#1131203)

* Previously, a dependency on the gtk2 packages was missing from the

wireshark packages. As a consequence, the Wireshark tool failed to start
under certain circumstances due to an unresolved symbol,
"gtk\_combo\_box\_text\_new\_with\_entry", which was added in gtk version 2.24.
With this update, a dependency on gtk2 has been added, and Wireshark now
always starts as expected. (BZ#1160388)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* With this update, the Wireshark tool supports process substitution, which

feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the standard input of
another process using the "<(command\_list)" syntax. When using process
substitution with large files as input, Wireshark failed to decode such
input. (BZ#1104210)

* Wireshark has been enhanced to enable capturing packets with nanosecond

time stamp precision, which allows better analysis of recorded network
traffic. (BZ#1146578)

All wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

**Date:** March 4, 2015

**Affected versions:** 1.12.0 to 1.12.3, 1.10.0 to 1.10.10

**Fixed versions:** 1.12.4, 1.10.13

**References:**

[Wireshark issue 11023](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/11023).

[CVE-2015-2191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2191).

## Details

### Description

The TNEF dissector could go into an infinite loop. Discovered by Vlad Tsyrklevich.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark

consume excessive CPU resources
by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or
by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.12.4, 1.10.13 or later.
