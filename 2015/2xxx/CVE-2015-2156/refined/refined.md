Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Netty's `CookieDecoder` method not strictly validating cookie name and value characters according to RFC6265. This lax validation allowed for the injection of characters that could bypass the `HttpOnly` flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `CookieDecoder` was too lenient in accepting characters in cookie names and values, deviating from the RFC6265 specification.
*   **HttpOnly Bypass:** This lax validation could be exploited to bypass the `HttpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Cookie Access:** By bypassing the `HttpOnly` flag, attackers could potentially access sensitive cookies via client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript).
*   **CSRF Token Exposure:** Applications reflecting cookie values back into the response body could expose CSRF tokens if the token is stored in a cookie rather than the session. This is specifically called out in the Play Framework advisory as an example.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Cookie Injection:** An attacker could inject specially crafted cookies with invalid characters to bypass the `HttpOnly` restriction.
*   **Reflected Cookie Values:** Applications that reflect cookie values back into the body of the response, especially when using cookies to store CSRF tokens, are vulnerable to this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or manipulate HTTP cookies, typically through a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The target application must rely on the vulnerable Netty library for cookie parsing and potentially reflect the cookie values in a response or rely on the HttpOnly flag to protect session or security-related cookies.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the LinkedIn Security Team.
*   The fix involves updating the `CookieDecoder` to strictly adhere to RFC6265 guidelines when validating cookie names and values.
*   The issue was addressed in Netty versions 3.9.8.Final, 3.10.3.Final, 4.0.28.Final and 4.1.0.Beta5.
*   Play Framework versions 2.0 to 2.3.8 were also vulnerable and were fixed in 2.3.9.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a result of Netty's lax cookie parsing, allowing attackers to bypass the HttpOnly security measure and potentially expose sensitive cookie data if the cookie is used for session management or reflects the cookie into response bodies.
