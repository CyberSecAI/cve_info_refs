An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the httpOnly flag on sensitive cookies.

Use of Netty in a unsupported way, such as parsing HTTP cookie headers could cause you to be vulnerable to this flaw.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1222923#c14)  Horia Chiorean    2015-06-19 11:35:22 UTC  ``` ModeShape does not use Netty in JDV.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1222923#c17)  Jason Shepherd    2015-08-04 00:46:36 UTC  ``` Most of the products that include Netty use it for TCP connection management for HornetQ messaging. We don't use it for parsing HTTP headers, so we won't fix this issue.  We will upgrade the Netty package in Fedora in an upcoming release.   ``` |  |

# Play Framework Security Advisory

## [Http only cookie bypass](#http-only-cookie-bypass)

### [CVE ID](#cve-id)

CVE-2015-2156

### [Date](#date)

09 May 2015

### [Description](#description)

A vulnerability has been found in Play’s cookie handling code that could allow an attacker to bypass the `httpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies.

### [Impact](#impact)

Any Play apps that reflect cookie values back into the body of a response are vulnerable to this. One example of when this might be a case is if using Play’s CSRF support with `csrf.cookie.name` configured, such that Play stores the csrf token in a cookie rather than the default of storing it in the session.

### [Affected Versions](#affected-versions)

* Play 2.0 - 2.3.8

### [Workarounds](#workarounds)

Upgrade to netty 3.9.8. For example:

```
libraryDependencies += "io.netty" % "netty" % "3.9.8.Final"

```
### [Fixes](#fixes)

The issue has been fixed in Play 2.3.9.

### CVSS metrics ([more info](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide))

### @slandelle **[slandelle](/slandelle)** commented [May 7, 2015](#issue-73910249)

Motivation:

RFC6265 specifies which characters are allowed in a cookie name and value.

Netty is currently too lax, which can used for HttpOnly escaping.

Modification:

Backport new RFC6265 compliant Cookie parsers in cookie subpackage.

Deprecate old Cookie encoders and decoders that will be dropped in 5.0.

Result:

The problem described in the motivation section is fixed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Date: Sat, 16 May 2015 17:08:22 -0700
From: Luca Carettoni <luca.carettoni@...isoft.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Netty/Play's Security Updates (CVE­-2015­-2156)

During a recent assessment, we discovered a security flaw within Netty’s
cookie parsing code which leads to a universal HttpOnly bypass in Play
Framework and potentially other frameworks using Netty as a dependency.

The issue has been fixed in Netty 3.9.8.Final, 3.10.3.Final, Netty
4.1.0.Beta5, Netty 4.0.28.Final and Play Framework 2.3.9.

<http://netty.io/news/2015/05/08/3-9-8-Final-and-3.html>
<https://www.playframework.com/security/vulnerability/CVE-2015-2156-HttpOnlyBypass>

Technical details of the vulnerability:
<http://engineering.linkedin.com/security/look-netty%E2%80%99s-recent-security-update-cve%C2%AD-2015%C2%AD-2156>

Many other projects using Netty may be vulnerable to similar
"side­-effects" of the incorrect cookies parsing routine. We recommend that
every project relying on Netty’s CookieDecoder method should mitigate the
potential risk by upgrading to the latest version.

Cheers,
Luca

# Netty 3.9.8.Final and 3.10.3.Final released

by
[normanmaurer](https://github.com/normanmaurer)

on
08-May-2015

I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 3.9.8.Final and 3.10.3.Final.

These releases contain a possible security fix and a few minor changes.

* Validate cookie name and value characters ([#3754](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3754))

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

## Special notes

### Validate cookie name and value characters

This problem was discovered by the [LinkedIn Security Team](https://www.linkedin.com) and could lead to security
problems due the improper parsing of Cookies (without strict validating).

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.

A special thank you to the [LinkedIn Security Team](https://www.linkedin.com) for reporting the possible security bug.
