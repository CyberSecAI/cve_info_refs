Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-2369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Windows Media Device Manager improperly handles the loading of specifically crafted DLL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Planting:** The core issue is a DLL planting vulnerability. The system is tricked into loading a malicious DLL from the user's working directory instead of the intended, legitimate one.
- **Improper DLL loading:** Windows Media Device Manager fails to validate the DLL before loading, allowing malicious code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** With complete control, the attacker can perform several actions, including:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DLL Placement:** The attacker must first place a specially crafted DLL in the target user's current working directory.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to open a specially crafted Rich Text Format (.RTF) file, which triggers the loading of the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file within the target user's working directory.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a crafted .RTF file.
- **No direct network access needed:** The vulnerability does not require direct network access for exploitation; it relies on a malicious file being present locally and user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is triggered when the Windows Media Device Manager is invoked (through opening the .RTF file).
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in severity.
- Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation when the bulletin was released.
- The provided document suggests a workaround by disabling the WMDMCESP.WMDMCESP ActiveX control, which is leveraged by the vulnerability.
