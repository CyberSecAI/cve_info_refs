Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper bounds checking on incoming data within specific API functions of the Medicomp MEDCIN Engine. Specifically, the API functions `GetProperty`'s `info_getproperty` and `UdfCodeList` are vulnerable. These functions do not validate the size of input, leading to buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:**  The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. When a crafted input is provided to the vulnerable functions (`info_getproperty` and `UdfCodeList`), it can overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow could also cause the software to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability could lead to the software leaking sensitive information to the attacker.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The attacker can overwrite data in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitable:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Specially Crafted Packets:** The attacker sends specially crafted packets to the vulnerable service over port 8190, targeting the `info_getproperty` and `UdfCodeList` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable MEDCIN Engine.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required for successful exploitation.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious network packets tailored to exploit the buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Medicomp MEDCIN Engine version 2.22.20142.166.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Medicomp MEDCIN Engine version 2.22.20153.226.
* The vulnerable functions are called through the API of the MEDCIN Engine.
* The affected products include: Allscripts Touchworks, AthenaHealth, Pulse Complete EHR, Greenway Health’s Vitera, Greenway Health’s Success EHS, Integreat MED3000, and DoD’s Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), and accompanied CD with Textbooks.
