- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to:
    - Installation of programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires an attacker to log on to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid logon credentials to the system and the ability to execute a specially crafted application.
