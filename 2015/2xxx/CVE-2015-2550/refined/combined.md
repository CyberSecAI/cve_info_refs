## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.

| **Vulnerability Title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

| Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2550](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2550) | No | No |
| Windows Object Reference Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2554](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2554) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit CVE-2015-2554.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Trusted Boot Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2552

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Windows fails to properly enforce the Windows [Trusted Boot](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) policy. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could disable code integrity checks, allowing test-signed executables and drivers to be loaded on a target device. Furthermore, an attacker could bypass Trusted Boot integrity validation for BitLocker and Device Encryption security features.

An attacker who has gained administrative privileges or who has physical access to a target device could exploit the vulnerability by applying a maliciously crafted Boot Configuration Data (BCD) setting. The security update addresses the vulnerability by improving how Windows parses BCD.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2015-2552](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2552). At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have administrative privileges or physical access to the target device.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

## Windows Mount Point Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2553

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows improperly validates junctions in certain scenarios in which mount points are being created. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially run arbitrary code in the security context of the user running a compromised application.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would most likely have to leverage another vulnerability that allows them to run arbitrary code in a sandboxed application. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles certain scenarios involving junction and mount-point creation.
