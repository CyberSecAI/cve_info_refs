- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Windows Hyper-V due to the way it handles packet size memory initialization in guest virtual machines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in Hyper-V.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution in the host context.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted application run by an authenticated and privileged user on a guest virtual machine hosted by Hyper-V.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid logon credentials for a guest virtual machine.
