## Vulnerabilities in Windows Hyper-V Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3072000)

Published: July 14, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution in a host context if a specially crafted application is run by an authenticated and privileged user on a guest virtual machine hosted by Hyper-V. An attacker must have valid logon credentials for a guest virtual machine to exploit this vulnerability.

This security update is rated Critical for Windows Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Hyper-V initializes system data structures in guest virtual machines. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3072000](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3072000).

## Vulnerability Information

## Hyper-V Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2361

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Hyper-V in a host context if an authenticated and privileged user on a guest virtual machine hosted by Hyper-V runs a specially crafted application.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid logon credentials for a guest virtual machine. Systems where Windows Hyper-V is installed are primarily at risk. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V handles packet size memory initialization in guest virtual machines.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
