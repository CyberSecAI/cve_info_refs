Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `win32k!itrp_IUP` function, which handles the IUP[] (Interpolate Untouched Points) instruction in TrueType fonts. The function does not properly validate the zone pointer, specifically a corner case mentioned in the TrueType specification where applying IUP to zone 0 is an error. This lack of validation allows the function to operate on memory outside of the allocated buffers leading to a pool-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `win32k!itrp_IUP` function reads from and writes to memory beyond the allocated buffer boundaries. This is caused by using an invalid zone pointer that isn't properly checked.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There's a lack of validation for the zone pointer used by the IUP instruction. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where zone pointer 0 is used, which is explicitly stated as an error in the TrueType spec.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Windows kernel. This effectively gives the attacker complete control of the system.
*   **System Compromise:** With kernel-level access, the attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full system privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause system crashes due to memory corruption. The provided crash logs in the Exploit-DB content show page faults, indicating a denial-of-service impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Font File:** An attacker can craft a malicious TrueType font file containing a specific sequence of instructions, namely `SZP2[0]` followed by `IUP[]`.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malformed font file, either through a document or by browsing a webpage that uses the font.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create or obtain a malformed TrueType font.
*   The attacker requires a means to deliver the malicious font file to the target system. This can be through social engineering, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or embedding the font in a document or webpage.
* No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the Windows kernel (`win32k.sys`) within the `itrp_IUP` function
*   Crashes occur at various locations within the `itrp_IUP` function, indicating that the specific memory corruption behavior varies slightly depending on the malicious font.
*   The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1, with Special Pools enabled making it easier to trigger a crash. However, crashes can also be observed on default Windows installations.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered through multiple vectors, including opening documents or browsing web pages with the crafted font.

The provided content gives a good overview of the technical details, including:
*   Specific code locations within the `win32k!itrp_IUP` function where crashes occur.
*   An explanation of the root cause related to a missing corner case in the TrueType instruction processing.
*  Sample malformed font files and associated crash logs
*   Exploitation is possible on default windows systems, but is easier to reproduce with special pools enabled for `win32k.sys`.

This is significantly more detail than the standard CVE description, and it provides a solid understanding of the technical nature of the vulnerability.
