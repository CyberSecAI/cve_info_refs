Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-2517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure in the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically, `Win32k.sys`) to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The exploit-db entry specifically mentions a use-after-free condition related to a global cursor object (`_gpqCursor`).
- **Memory Corruption:** The Microsoft bulletin describes the vulnerability as a "Win32k Memory Corruption Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability." The root cause is that the kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory, leading to corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to full system control.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service:**  The exploit-db entry indicates the vulnerability can lead to a crash, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access required:** The attacker must first log on to the target system.
- **Specially crafted application:** An attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker requires valid logon credentials on the targeted system.
- **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a specifically crafted program on the target machine.
