  "CVE-2015-2714": {
    "description": "Security researcher **Muneaki Nishimura** reported that Firefox for Android would write potentially sensitive data to the Android `logcat` that was encoded as part of logged URL strings. On Android 4.0 or earlier systems, `logcat` data is available to any application having `READ_LOGS` permission, leading to potential privacy violations. This does not affect non-Android versions of Firefox and is mitigated in versions of Android higher than 4.0.",
    "root_cause": "Firefox for Android was logging URL strings with query parameters and fragments to the Android logcat. On Android 4.0 and lower, any app with the `READ_LOGS` permission can read this log data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information disclosure",
      "Logging of sensitive data"
     ],
    "impact": "Exposure of potentially sensitive URL data, including query strings and fragments, to other applications on Android 4.0 and lower, due to the lack of restrictions on logcat access on those Android versions.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious application with READ_LOGS permission could access the logcat and extract the sensitive data from the logged URLs.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an application with `READ_LOGS` permission installed on an Android device running 4.0 or lower."
