  "CVE-2015-2151": {
    "description": "The x86 emulator in Xen 3.2.x through 4.5.x does not properly ignore segment overrides for instructions with register operands, which allows local guest users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
    "affected_versions": "Xen 3.2.x through 4.5.x",
    "root_cause": "The x86 emulator in Xen does not properly handle segment overrides for instructions with register operands.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of segment overrides",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A local guest user can potentially obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local guest user execution of crafted instructions",
      "Abuse of improper segment override handling"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access to a guest VM",
