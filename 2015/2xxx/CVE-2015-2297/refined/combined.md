> * Remote null pointer dereference

Use CVE-2015-2297 for (only) this null pointer dereference.

> * Remote buffer overflow
> If the server is misconfigured, a remote user can trigger a buffer
> overflow by requesting a resource of a certain length.
> <http://patrick.ld.net.au/libcsoap/nanohttp-buffer-1.patch>

First, this doesn't seem to be a new discovery.
<http://csoap.sourceforge.net/downloads.php> links to
<http://csoap.sourceforge.net/downloads/libsoap-snapshot.tar.gz> and
this contains a libsoap-20070125 top-level directory with a
nanohttp/nanohttp-server.c file dated 2007-01-01. This file apparently
has the bug fixed in a (very) slightly different way:

   char buffer[256];
   snprintf(buffer, 256, "service '%s' is not registered properly (service function is NULL)", req->path);

More importantly, we haven't been able to find any indication that
this issue is within the scope of CVE. As far as we can tell, building
libcsoap does not create a sample HTTP server. If someone writes their
own application to create an HTTP server, the "else" code path after
"if (service->func != NULL)" should always be unreachable. If this
code path is reachable, that's a bug in their application and
therefore a site-specific problem. Unless the upstream vendor has
stated something else, the behavior of the library is undefined if the
application is wrong. If the actual behavior is a remote buffer
overflow, that's within the bounds of undefined behavior. We don't
feel that there are required security properties for a code path
that's not reachable in any supported or reasonable use of a library.

Also, we don't think it's especially likely that someone would write
an application in which service->func can ever be NULL. For example,
libsoap-20070125 has a nanohttp-admin.c file in which service->func is
always the _httpd_admin_entry function.
