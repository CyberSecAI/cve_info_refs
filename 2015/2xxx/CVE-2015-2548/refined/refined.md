Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-2548:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Tablet Input Band failing to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the Microsoft Tablet Input Band.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, enabling them to:
* Install programs
* View, change, or delete data
* Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that host user-provided content or advertisements.
*  **Email/Instant message:** An attacker could convince the user to click a link in an email/instant message, or to open a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visit a website or open an attachment). The attacker cannot force users to view the attacker-controlled content.
*  The attacker needs to craft malicious content designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the Microsoft Tablet Input Band handles objects in memory.
* The provided content also includes a workaround involving denying access to `TipBand.dll`.
* The affected systems and severity are outlined in the bulletin. Notably, the update is only offered to Windows 7 systems with Tablet PC Components enabled.
