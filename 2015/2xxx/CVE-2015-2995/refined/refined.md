{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way, specifically by not properly handling null bytes in file names.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated file upload",
    "Insecure handling of zip file contents",
    "Null byte injection vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution can be achieved by uploading a malicious WAR file that gets deployed on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted POST request to the /sysaid/rdslogs endpoint with a ZIP archive containing a malicious WAR file and a null byte injected into the filename.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. Target Java version must be Java 6 or Java 7 up to 7u25."
