(CVE) ID: CVE-2015-2249
```
The provided content contains multiple bug reports and security advisories related to Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Some of them are related to CVE-2015-2249. Below are the relevant extractions:

**Bug 98216:**

*   **Root cause:** Unsafe content was not being filtered by the defanger. Specifically, the bug was related to the processing of SVG tags, including `<use>`, `<animate>`, `<foreignobject>`, and `<embed>` tags. The vulnerability allowed for JavaScript execution via SVG tags inside `application/xml` files.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Persistent XSS vulnerability due to improper filtering of user-supplied content. The defanger was not effectively blocking certain SVG tags which could lead to script execution.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when a user views content containing the injected SVG code.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through specially crafted email messages or files containing the malicious SVG code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious SVG code into an email message or a file that will be viewed by another user.

**Bug 96973:**

*   **Root cause:**  XSS vulnerability in the "Find Shares" dialog due to a lack of sanitization of shared folder names.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application was not encoding HTML characters when creating the tree item text in the "Find Shares" dialog, leading to potential XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a shared folder name, which would then be executed when a user views the "Find Shares" dialog.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be able to create a shared folder with a malicious name.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create shared folders with arbitrary names.

**Bug 99914:**

*   **Root cause:**  Potential XSS vulnerability in `FileUploadServlet.java` due to insufficient restrictions on characters allowed for the `requestId` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `FileUploadServlet` was not properly validating or sanitizing the `requestId`, which allowed an attacker to inject potentially malicious characters.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious script through the `requestId` parameter leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.
*  **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through a crafted request with a malicious `requestId` sent to the `FileUploadServlet`
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the FileUploadServlet.

**Bug 98215:**

*   **Root cause:** The defanger was not properly blocking VBScript and could be bypassed using tabs and other character encoding.
*  **Weaknesses:**  Persistent XSS due to the ability to bypass the defanger. Specifically, VBScript was not being blocked, and tabs and encoded characters were not being stripped from attributes such as `href` and `action`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute when a user views the crafted content.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted emails or files containing malicious vbscript and javascript code with tab characters and other encodings.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to inject such content into an email or file.
