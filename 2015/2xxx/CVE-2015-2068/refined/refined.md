Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies within the Magento MAGMI plugin. Specifically, the `ajax_pluginconf.php` file is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and the `magmi.php` and `magmi_import_run.php` files are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `ajax_pluginconf.php` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input via the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `magmi.php` and `magmi_import_run.php` scripts are vulnerable to XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts through the `profile` parameter in `magmi.php` and through the request parameters in `magmi_import_run.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** Successful exploitation of the LFI vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files or system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). This can lead to further compromise of the server and the Magento application.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirection of the victim to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a manipulated `file` parameter in the `ajax_pluginconf.php` to access sensitive files on the server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `profile` parameter in `magmi.php` and through the request parameters in `magmi_import_run.php`. This could be achieved by sending crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server running the vulnerable MAGMI plugin.
*   For the LFI, the attacker needs to know the path to a file they wish to access on the server and must have network access to the target server.
*   For the XSS, the attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the crafted link, or access a vulnerable page with the crafted malicious payload in the URL.
