Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2853:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Session Fixation vulnerability. The user's session ID is set before authentication and remains unchanged after successful login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session ID is set prior to authentication.
- The session ID is not invalidated or changed upon successful authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can hijack a victim's session, granting the attacker the same access and permissions as the victim user. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the appliance's interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to obtain or set a session ID before the victim logs in. This could be achieved via network sniffing (if session IDs are not transmitted over secure channels) or by directly setting the session ID (likely by exploiting some other vulnerability).
- Once the attacker obtains or sets a valid session ID they must then induce the victim user to log in with that specific session id.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to obtain or set a session ID before the user logs into the Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim user to login with that specific session id. This may or may not require network sniffing capabilities, depending on how the session ids are transferred and whether the attacker can set arbitrary session ids.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance versions 3.6.x to 3.8.3.
- The provided text specifies that the session ID is set *prior* to authentication and is *not* changed at the time of authentication, which clearly describes the session fixation vulnerability.
- The fix is to update to Blue Coat SSL Visibility version 3.8.4.
- The provided text has a reference to CWE-384 which directly relates to session fixation.
