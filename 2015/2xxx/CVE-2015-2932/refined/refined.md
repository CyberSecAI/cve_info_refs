Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incomplete blacklist of dangerous parts of HTML5 used in SVG filtering within MediaWiki. Specifically, the filter to prevent injecting JavaScript using `animate` elements was incorrect. It failed to account for all variations of the `animate` tag with the `attributeName="xlink:href"` attribute, which can be used to execute JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete input sanitization/validation
- Insufficient filtering of SVG elements, specifically the `animate` element and its `attributeName="xlink:href"` attribute.
- Lack of proper blacklisting for `animate` tags leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a MediaWiki user's browser.
- This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies/session information, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious SVG file containing the vulnerable `animate` tag with the `attributeName="xlink:href"` attribute.
- This malicious SVG file is uploaded and displayed on a MediaWiki page.
- When a user views the page, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within the SVG is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload or insert SVG files into the MediaWiki instance. This usually requires an account, and depending on the MediaWiki setup, potentially certain user rights.
- No other special position is required. The attack occurs client-side.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The initial fix attempted to blacklist certain tags and attributes, but this fix was incomplete. The vulnerability was bypassed using an alternate namespace prefix.
- The vulnerability existed due to an incomplete fix for [T71008](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T71008) in MediaWiki versions 1.19.19, 1.22.11 and 1.23.4.
