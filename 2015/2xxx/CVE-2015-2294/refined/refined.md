Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in various PHP scripts within the pfSense web interface. Specifically, multiple GET parameters are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input from HTTP GET parameters before rendering it within the HTML page. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within a user's browser.
   - The vulnerable parameters are:
      - `"zone"` in `/status_captiveportal.php`
      - `"if"` and `"dragtable"` in `/firewall_rules.php`
      - `"queue"` in `/firewall_shaper.php`
      - `"id"` in `/services_unbound_acls.php`
      - `"filterlogentries_time"`, `"filterlogentries_sourceipaddress"`, `"filterlogentries_sourceport"`, `"filterlogentries_destinationipaddress"`, `"filterlogentries_interfaces"`, `"filterlogentries_destinationport"`, `"filterlogentries_protocolflags"`, and `"filterlogentries_qty"` in `/diag_logs_filter.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the logged-in administrator's browser. This could lead to:
    - Stealing administrator's session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the administrator (e.g. changing settings).
    - Gaining complete control over the web application and potentially the entire system, as pfSense runs with root privileges and allows OS command execution through the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code. This can be done through:
    - Phishing attacks (emailing a malicious link)
    - Social engineering attacks (placing a malicious link on a forum or other web resource)
    - Compromising a trusted website to host the malicious link

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the web interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in pfSense administrator to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions a separate CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2015-2295), which is not the focus of this analysis.
- The advisory provides proof-of-concept (PoC) code snippets for each vulnerable parameter which use the javascript `alert()` function.
- The advisory states that pfSense runs with root privileges which increases the potential severity of an exploit
- The advisory recommends updating to pfSense 2.2.1.
