Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SAP Mobile Platform's XML parser, which validates incoming XML requests using a user-specified DTD. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML, leading to an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of external entities in XML processing. The application parses XML documents that include references to external entities, which can be controlled by the attacker.
- **Unvalidated User-Specified DTD:** The system uses a DTD specified by the user without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a specific XML request with a malicious DTD.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting an XML Entity Expansion attack, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
- **SMB Relay Attack (Indirect):** Although not directly an XXE issue, the advisory also mentions SMB relay attacks as a potential consequence where an attacker can relay authentication information after a user authenticates into the attacker's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network.
- **XML Request Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious XML request with a crafted DTD to the `/scc/messagebroker/http` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected SAP Mobile Platform instance.
- **Knowledge of SAP Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint, in this case `/scc/messagebroker/http`.
- **XML Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to create XML payloads with external entities and DTDs.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions SAP Mobile Platform 2.2 and 2.3 are affected and that other versions are probably affected.
- SAP Security Note 2125358 provides a solution to this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported to SAP on November 6, 2014.
