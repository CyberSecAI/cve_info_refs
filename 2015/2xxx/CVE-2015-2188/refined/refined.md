Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2188:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-2188, and describes a crash vulnerability in Wireshark's WCP dissector, which matches the vulnerability described in the Wireshark advisory.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the WCP dissector when decompressing data.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The WCP dissector has a flaw that can lead to a crash when processing compressed data.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- A successful attack can cause Wireshark to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- This can occur by injecting a malformed WCP packet onto the network or by opening a malicious packet capture file.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Network injection:** An attacker could inject a malformed WCP packet into a network traffic stream being captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious capture file:** An attacker can create a malicious capture file containing malformed WCP data and trick a user into opening the file with Wireshark.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to either inject traffic on a network being monitored by Wireshark or be able to get a victim to open a crafted capture file.
- **Malicious WCP Data:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or obtain a packet with malformed compressed WCP data that triggers the vulnerability.

**Summary of extracted information:**

The vulnerability is a crash in Wireshark's WCP dissector that occurs during decompression of malformed data. An attacker can trigger this crash by injecting malformed WCP packets into a network stream or by getting a user to open a malformed capture file. This vulnerability results in denial of service.
