##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3089664)

Published: September 8, 2015 | Updated: November 10, 2015

**Version:** 5.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Office 2007
* Microsoft Office 2010
* Microsoft Office 2013
* Microsoft Office 2013 RT
* Microsoft Office 2016

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of the following software:

* Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011
* Microsoft Excel 2016 for Mac
* Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory and by modifying how SharePoint validates web requests. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3089664](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3089664).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2520](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2520) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2521](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2521) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2523) | No | No |

## Microsoft SharePoint XSS Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2522

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which could result in spoofing, exists when SharePoint fails to properly sanitize user-supplied web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks and run script (in the security context of the logged-on user) with malicious content that appears authentic. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, including authentication cookies and recently submitted data.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted content to a target site. Because of the vulnerability, in specific situations specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script to be run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content. For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted a specially crafted web request to a target site, any webpage on that site that contains the specially crafted content is a potential vector for cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a webpage that contains the specially crafted content, the script could be run in the security context of the user.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how SharePoint validates web requests.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Microsoft Office Malformed EPS File Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2545

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office that could be exploited when a user opens a file containing a malformed graphics image or when a user inserts a malformed graphics image into an Office file. Such a file could also be included in an email attachment. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted EPS file that could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system.

This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker could host a specially crafted website containing an Office file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

If Microsoft Word is the selected email reader, which is the default setting, then an attacker could leverage Outlook for an email-based attack by sending a specially crafted file, containing an EPS image binary, to the targeted user. In this scenario this attack vector requires minimal user action (as in viewing a specially crafted email through the preview pane in Outlook) to be exploited.

Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Office installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had received reports of limited targeted attacks using this vulnerability.

### Mitigations

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a website that contains an Office file containing a specially crafted EPS image that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Modify the Access Control List to deny access to EPSIMP32.FLT for ALL USERS**

  There are two ways to implement this workaround. You can manually apply the workaround by using either the Registry Method or the Script Method to deny access to EPSIMP32.FLT for ALL USERS. Alternatively, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3092845](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3092845) to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solutions.

| Note: |
| --- |
| See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3092845](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3092845)to use automated Microsoft Fix it Solution 51037 to deny access to EPSIMP32.FLT. |

**Registry Method**

**Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit.exe**, and then click **OK**.
2. Navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Graphics Filters\Import\EPS**
3. Take note of the value of **Path**. In explorer, navigate to the **EPSIMP32.FLT** file at the location listed as the value of **Path**.
4. Right click on **EPSIMP32.FLT** file and select **Properties**.
5. On the **Security** tab, click **Advanced**.
6. Clear the **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate to this object**â¦ checkbox and click **Remove**.
7. Click **OK**, **Yes**, and then **OK.**

**Script Method**

**For all supported 32-bit editions of OS**

Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

`takeown /f "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" /save %TEMP%\ EPSIMP32 _ACL.TXT icacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" /deny everyone:(F)`

**For all supported x64-based editions of OS**

Run the following commands from a command prompt as an administrator:

`takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" /save %TEMP%\ EPSIMP32 _ACL.TXT icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP32.FLT" /deny everyone:(F)`

**Impact of workaround**: This workaround prevents EPS files from loading in Office, which may prevent certain images from displaying properly in Office. This setting must be reverted before installing future security updates.

**How to undo the workaround**

You can undo the workaround by running the commands from a command prompt as shown here. Alternatively, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3092845 to use the automated Microsoft Fix to undo the workaround.

| Note: |
