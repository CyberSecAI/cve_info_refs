Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-2520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs when Microsoft Office fails to properly handle objects in memory. Specifically, it appears to involve a freed heap allocation being accessed. The exploit-db entry indicates that the vulnerability is triggered by specific modifications to BIFF record lengths within an Excel file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is that a memory location is freed, and subsequently, the program attempts to access this freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control over the system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Office Files:** The attack vector involves an attacker creating a malicious Microsoft Office file (specifically an Excel file in the provided exploit). This file contains the crafted BIFF record lengths designed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Email or Web-Based Attacks:**
    *   **Email:** An attacker can send the malicious file as an email attachment, attempting to trick the user into opening it.
    *   **Web-Based:** An attacker could host the file on a website or use a compromised website to host the file. Users would need to be tricked into visiting this website or opening the file.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction to open the malicious file for exploitation to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious File:** The attacker needs the technical skills to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (in this case Excel file) that triggers the memory corruption.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the file through email, web links, or other deceptive means.
*   **No Special System Access:** The attacker does not require any specific access rights or privileges on the victim machine prior to the exploitation attempt.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to older versions of Microsoft Office, notably Office 2007. It is listed as "Important" in Microsoft's security bulletin for affected versions of Excel 2007, 2010 and 2011 for Mac, and is listed as "Critical" for Office suites 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016.
*   The provided exploit database entry provides a crash log and further details on the specific code location. This information goes beyond the high-level description in the Microsoft security bulletin.
* The exploit-db entry includes proof of concept files.
