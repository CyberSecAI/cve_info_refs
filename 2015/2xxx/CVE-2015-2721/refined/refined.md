## Analysis of CVE-2015-2721

The provided documents discuss CVE-2015-2721 and its impact on various software products.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect state transition handling within the TLS state machine in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). Specifically, the client improperly allows an ECDHE_ECDSA exchange where the server omits the ServerKeyExchange message. The NSS client will then incorrectly use the EC key from the ECDSA certificate rather than aborting the handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- NSS incorrectly permits skipping of ServerKeyExchange messages in ECDHE_ECDSA exchanges.
- NSS clients do not verify that the key exchange algorithm requires a peer's public key, leading to use of certificate's long-term key.
- Vulnerable TLS implementations use the same code base, meaning that a vulnerability in the original code can amplify the same vulnerability across many pieces of code that uses it as a baseline.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can bypass forward secrecy by skipping the ServerKeyExchange message in an ECDHE_ECDSA exchange resulting in downgrade to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange.
- A malicious server can trick a browser into engaging in an insecure connection by silently downgrading the connection from an ECDHE exchange to a non-forward-secret one. 
- If False Start is enabled, the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys.
- Potential compromise of ECDSA private key and the possibility to impersonate the server.
-  A possibility of the server sending a ClientHello, which then cause the client to switch roles or cause edge case problems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Tampering with handshake messages, especially DNS information.
- Tricking users into opening malicious websites that trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- In some attack scenarios, the attacker might need a privileged position within the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the client-side implementation of NSS allowing the server to omit the "ServerKeyExchange" message.
*   The client uses the public key from server's certificate when the "ServerKeyExchange" is missing, which is not part of the TLS protocol.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple products and systems using NSS, including Firefox, Thunderbird, and various Linux distributions.
*   Patches involve updating the NSS library to a version that enforces proper state transition handling and rejects DHE key sizes below 768 or 1024 bits.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited silently, downgrading the connection to a less secure cipher suite.
*   The SMACK-TLS paper explains how this issue can cause problems for cookie disclosure + false start, which is a high-severity issue.

In summary, the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2721 is caused by a flaw in NSS that allows the skipping of the ServerKeyExchange message, leading to a downgrade of TLS connections and potentially to exposure of user data. The vulnerability can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attacker capable of manipulating network traffic. The provided documents also detail the specific patches and updates needed to fix this issue in various software products.
