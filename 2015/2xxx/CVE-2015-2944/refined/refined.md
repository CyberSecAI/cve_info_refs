Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2944:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `HtmlResponse` output in Apache Sling API and Servlets Post components does not properly escape URLs in HTML. This lack of proper escaping allows for the injection of malicious scripts within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability exists because the malicious script is injected through the URL and reflected back in the error page or job completion output.
- Improper Input Sanitization/Escaping: The core issue is the failure to sanitize or escape URLs before including them in HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's web browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously Crafted URLs: The attack vector involves crafting a URL that contains JavaScript code.  This URL is then processed by the vulnerable component, and the injected script is executed when the generated output (e.g., an error page) is rendered in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send requests with crafted URLs to the affected server.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both `org/apache/sling/api/servlets/HtmlResponse` and `org/apache/sling/servlets/post/HtmlResponse`.
- A POST request with a `<script>` tag in the URL can trigger the vulnerability.
- Example URL:  `http://localhost:4502/does/not/exist.html/%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(29679)%3c/script%3e`

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Sling API 2.2.0 and earlier
- Apache Sling Servlets Post 2.1.0 and earlier

**Fixed Versions:**
- Apache Sling API 2.2.2
- Apache Sling Servlets Post 2.1.2
