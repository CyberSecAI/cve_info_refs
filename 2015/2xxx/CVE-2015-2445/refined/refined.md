The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS15-079) detailing multiple vulnerabilities addressed in a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer. It includes details for CVE-2015-2445.

**CVE-2015-2445**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer failing to properly use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This makes it easier for attackers to predict memory offsets.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** ASLR bypass. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass ASLR.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Bypassing ASLR doesn't allow for arbitrary code execution on its own but makes it easier for an attacker to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution vulnerabilities. By bypassing ASLR, an attacker can more reliably execute code on the target system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to convince a user running an affected version of Internet Explorer to browse a malicious website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a malicious site.
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious site using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
    *   The attacker needs to exploit another vulnerability in conjunction with this ASLR bypass to gain code execution.

This document provides more detailed information than the basic CVE description, including the specific nature of the ASLR bypass vulnerability and its impact when combined with other vulnerabilities.
