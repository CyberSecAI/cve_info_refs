Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `InvertibleRWFunction::CalculateInverse` function within the `rw.cpp` file of the libcrypto++ library. This function, responsible for implementing the Rabin-Williams digital signature algorithm, did not properly implement blinding techniques to mask private key operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper blinding: The core issue is the lack of proper blinding of private key operations in the Rabin-Williams signature algorithm implementation, specifically within the `CalculateInverse` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Private key retrieval: Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve a user's private key by mounting a timing attack. The timing of the cryptographic operations was not sufficiently randomized, leading to information leakage.
- Remote Timing Attack: The vulnerability could be exploited remotely through timing analysis of the cryptographic operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by measuring the time it takes for the server to perform cryptographic operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system to perform timing attacks by interacting with the service that uses the vulnerable cryptographic operations.
- Timing Measurement: The attacker requires the capability to precisely measure the execution time of the cryptographic operations performed by the vulnerable server.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix implemented involved squaring the random number `r` to satisfy Jacobi requirements before calculating the inverse. This change is intended to prevent the timing information leakage.
- The vulnerability affects libcrypt++ version 5.6.2 and prior versions.

In summary, CVE-2015-2141 is a timing side-channel attack vulnerability in libcrypto++'s Rabin-Williams digital signature implementation due to improper blinding of private key operations. It allows remote attackers to potentially recover private keys by timing the cryptographic operations.
