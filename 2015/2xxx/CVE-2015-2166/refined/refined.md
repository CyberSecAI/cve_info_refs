  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Instance Monitor component of Ericsson Drutt MSDP, which allows an attacker to perform directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability",
    "Arbitrary file access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can access arbitrary files on the file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via HTTP GET requests with crafted URLs containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`).",
