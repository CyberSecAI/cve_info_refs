Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from the way Microsoft Office applications are instantiated via a COM control within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it's related to how Internet Explorer handles the instantiation of these Office applications via COM controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can exploit this to gain higher privileges than they would normally have in the context of Internet Explorer. It allows bypassing the Internet Explorer sandbox.
- **COM Object Instantiation:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to instantiate affected Office applications through a COM control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevated Privileges:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges, gaining the ability to run code with the permissions of the current user, which could be higher than the restricted permissions imposed by the Internet Explorer sandbox.
- **Sandbox Escape:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to break out of the Internet Explorer sandbox, potentially giving them access to more system resources.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The vulnerability is often used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allows remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit an RCE to execute code with low integrity, then use this vulnerability to elevate those processes to a medium integrity level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Internet Explorer:** The attacker would need to use Internet Explorer to exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into downloading a specially crafted application
- **COM Control:** The attack vector involves instantiating an affected Office application via a COM control in Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Existing IE Vulnerability:** The attacker would most likely need to chain this with an existing vulnerability in Internet Explorer that they can use to trick the user into downloading a malicious application.
- **Ability to Create a Malicious File/Website:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious file or host a website that can trigger the vulnerable code path in Internet Explorer.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into performing some action, such as downloading and opening a specially crafted application or visiting a malicious website, for the exploit to work.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text explicitly states that this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
- The security update addresses this vulnerability by preventing Internet Explorer from instantiating the affected Office applications via COM control.
- Microsoft was not aware of any attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability at the time the security bulletin was released.

The provided content gives more detail than the description in the CVE, including the fact that this vulnerability is related to COM objects being instantiated from within IE.
