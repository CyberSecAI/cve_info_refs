- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance does not enforce same-origin policy in X-Frame-Options response headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to lack of enforcement of the same-origin policy.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can conduct clickjacking attacks by embedding the vulnerable application in a crafted web page. This can trick users into performing unintended actions on the appliance.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted web page controlled by the attacker that includes the vulnerable application in an iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage, and to trick the user into visiting it while the user is logged into the vulnerable appliance.
