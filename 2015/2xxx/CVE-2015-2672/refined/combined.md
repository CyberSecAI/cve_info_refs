x86/fpu/xsaves: Fix improper uses of \_\_ex\_tableCommit:
f31a9f7c7169 ("x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area")
introduced alternative instructions for XSAVES/XRSTORS and commit:
adb9d526e982 ("x86/xsaves: Add xsaves and xrstors support for booting time")
added support for the XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions at boot time.
Unfortunately both failed to properly protect them against faulting:
The 'xstate\_fault' macro will use the closest label named '1'
backward and that ends up in the .altinstr\_replacement section
rather than in .text. This means that the kernel will never find
in the \_\_ex\_table the .text address where this instruction might
fault, leading to serious problems if userspace manages to
trigger the fault.

This reverts commit abc86d0f99242b7f142b7cb8f90e30081dd3c256 as it is
broken in 3.19 and is easier to revert here than try to fix it.

cxl: Add missing return statement after handling AFU errror
commit a6130ed253a931d2169c26ab0958d81b0dce4d6e upstream.
We were missing a return statement in the PSL interrupt handler in the
case of an AFU error, which would trigger an "Unhandled CXL PSL IRQ"
warning. We do actually handle these type of errors (by notifying
userspace), so add the missing return IRQ\_HANDLED so we don't throw
unecessary warnings.

call of\_node\_get() otherwise np's reference count isn't incremented and
it might go away. Rename pnv\_pci\_to\_phb\_node() to pnv\_pci\_get\_phb\_node()

cxl: Use image state defaults for reloading FPGA
commit 4beb5421babee1204757b877622830c6aa31be6d upstream.
Select defaults such that a PERST causes flash image reload. Select which
image based on what the card is set up to load.
CXL\_VSEC\_PERST\_LOADS\_IMAGE selects whether PERST assertion causes flash image
load.
CXL\_VSEC\_PERST\_SELECT\_USER selects which image is loaded on the next PERST.

sched/autogroup: Fix failure to set cpu.rt\_runtime\_us
commit 1fe89e1b6d270aa0d3452c60d38461ea589594e3 upstream.
Because task\_group() uses a cache of autogroup\_task\_group(), whose
output depends on sched\_class, switching classes can generate
problems.
In particular, when started as fair, the cache points to the
autogroup, so when switching to RT the tg\_rt\_schedulable() test fails
for every cpu.rt\_{runtime,period}\_us change because now the autogroup
has tasks and no runtime.
Furthermore, going back to the previous semantics of varying
task\_group() with sched\_class has the down-side that the sched\_debug
output varies as well, even though the task really is in the
autogroup.
Therefore add an autogroup exception to tg\_has\_rt\_tasks() -- such that
both (all) task\_group() usages in sched/core now have one. And remove
all the remnants of the variable task\_group() output.

vmstat: do not use deferrable delayed work for vmstat\_update
commit ba4877b9ca51f80b5d30f304a46762f0509e1635 upstream.
Vinayak Menon has reported that an excessive number of tasks was throttled
in the direct reclaim inside too\_many\_isolated() because NR\_ISOLATED\_FILE
was relatively high compared to NR\_INACTIVE\_FILE. However it turned out
that the real number of NR\_ISOLATED\_FILE was 0 and the per-cpu
vm\_stat\_diff wasn't transferred into the global counter.
vmstat\_work which is responsible for the sync is defined as deferrable
delayed work which means that the defined timeout doesn't wake up an idle
CPU. A CPU might stay in an idle state for a long time and general effort
is to keep such a CPU in this state as long as possible which might lead
to all sorts of troubles for vmstat consumers as can be seen with the
excessive direct reclaim throttling.
This patch basically reverts 39bf6270f524 ("VM statistics: Make timer
deferrable") but it shouldn't cause any problems for idle CPUs because
only CPUs with an active per-cpu drift are woken up since 7cc36bbddde5
("vmstat: on-demand vmstat workers v8") and CPUs which are idle for a
longer time shouldn't have per-cpu drift.

pinctrl: imx25: fix numbering for pins
commit 34027ca2bbc6043fea8fc5c4a82670518b6be7df upstream.
The pin id for a given tuple listed in a fsl,pins property is calculated

As the first available register is at offset 0x8 and configures the pad
MX25\_PAD\_A10 the right id for this pin is 2. All other pins are off by
one, too.
This patch drops the definition MX25\_PAD\_RESERVE1 (together with its
only use) and decrements all following values by 1.

ath5k: fix spontaneus AR5312 freezes
commit 8bfae4f9938b6c1f033a5159febe97e441d6d526 upstream.
Sometimes while CPU have some load and ath5k doing the wireless
interface reset the whole WiSoC completely freezes. Set of tests shows
that using atomic delay function while we wait interface reset helps to
avoid such freezes.
The easiest way to reproduce this issue: create a station interface,
start continous scan with wpa\_supplicant and load CPU by something. Or
just create multiple station interfaces and put them all in continous
scan.
This patch partially reverts the commit 1846ac3dbec0 ("ath5k: Use
usleep\_range where possible"), which replaces initial udelay()
by usleep\_range().
I do not know actual source of this issue, but all looks like that HW
freeze is caused by transaction on internal SoC bus, while wireless
block is in reset state.
Also I should note that I do not know how many chips are affected, but I
did not see this issue with chips, other than AR5312.

NFS: Don't invalidate a submounted dentry in nfs\_prime\_dcache()
commit 6c441c254eea2354d686be7f5544bcd79fb6a61f upstream.
If we're traversing a directory which contains a submounted filesystem,
or one that has a referral, the NFS server that is processing the READDIR
request will often return information for the underlying (mounted-on)
directory. It may, or may not, also return filehandle information.
If this happens, and the lookup in nfs\_prime\_dcache() returns the
dentry for the submounted directory, the filehandle comparison will
fail, and we call d\_invalidate(). Post-commit 8ed936b5671bf
("vfs: Lazily remove mounts on unlinked files and directories."), this
means the entire subtree is unmounted.
The following minimal patch addresses this problem by punting on
the invalidation if there is a submount.
Kudos to Neil Brown  for having tracked down this
issue (see link).

eCryptfs: don't pass fs-specific ioctl commands through
commit 6d65261a09adaa374c05de807f73a144d783669e upstream.
eCryptfs can't be aware of what to expect when after passing an
arbitrary ioctl command through to the lower filesystem. The ioctl
command may trigger an action in the lower filesystem that is
incompatible with eCryptfs.
One specific example is when one attempts to use the Btrfs clone
ioctl command when the source file is in the Btrfs filesystem that
eCryptfs is mounted on top of and the destination fd is from a new file
created in the eCryptfs mount. The ioctl syscall incorrectly returns
success because the command is passed down to Btrfs which thinks that it
was able to do the clone operation. However, the result is an empty
eCryptfs file.
This patch allows the trim, {g,s}etflags, and {g,s}etversion ioctl
commands through and then copies up the inode metadata from the lower
inode to the eCryptfs inode to catch any changes made to the lower
inode's metadata. Those five ioctl commands are mostly common across all
filesystems but the whitelist may need to be further pruned in the
future.

efi/libstub: Fix boundary checking in efi\_high\_alloc()
commit 7ed620bb343f434f8a85f830020c04988df2a140 upstream.
While adding support loading kernel and initrd above 4G to grub2 in legacy
mode, I was referring to efi\_high\_alloc().
That will allocate buffer for kernel and then initrd, and initrd will
use kernel buffer start as limit.
During testing found two buffers will be overlapped when initrd size is
very big like 400M.
It turns out efi\_high\_alloc() boundary checking is not right.
end - size will be the new start, and should not compare new
start with max, we need to make sure end is smaller than max.
[ Basically, with the current efi\_high\_alloc() code it's possible to
allocate memory above 'max', because efi\_high\_alloc() doesn't check
that the tail of the allocation is below 'max'.
If you have an EFI memory map with a single entry that looks like so,
[0xc0000000-0xc0004000]
And want to allocate 0x3000 bytes below 0xc0003000 the current code
will allocate [0xc0001000-0xc0004000], not [0xc0000000-0xc0003000]
like you would expect. - Matt ]

drm/i915: Check for driver readyness before handling an underrun interrupt
commit 54fc7c1c961cb39edfe31f8a3f5ba6414e134b37 upstream.
When we takeover from the BIOS and install our interrupt handler, the
BIOS may have left us a few surprises in the form of spontaneous
interrupts. (This is especially likely on hardware like 965gm where
display fifo underruns are continuous and the GMCH cannot filter that
interrupt souce.) As we enable our IRQ early so that we can use it
during hardware probing, our interrupt handler must be prepared to
handle a few sources prior to being fully configured. As such, we need
to add a simple is-ready check prior to dereferencing our KMS state for
reporting underruns.

drm/i915: avoid processing spurious/shared interrupts in low-power states
commit 2dd2a883aad7c852400027c2261bcab69d9e238e upstream.
Atm, it's possible that the interrupt handler is called when the device
is in D3 or some other low-power state. It can be due to another device
that is still in D0 state and shares the interrupt line with i915, or on
some platforms there could be spurious interrupts even without sharing
the interrupt line. The latter case was reported by Klaus Ethgen using a
Lenovo x61p machine (gen 4). He noticed this issue via a system
suspend/resume hang and bisected it to the following commit:

drm/i915: use runtime irq suspend/resume in freeze/thaw
This is a problem, since in low-power states IIR will always read
0xffffffff resulting in an endless IRQ servicing loop.
Fix this by handling interrupts only when the driver explicitly enables
them and so it's guaranteed that the interrupt registers return a valid
value.
Note that this issue existed even before the above commit, since during
runtime suspend/resume we never unregistered the handler.
v2:
- clarify the purpose of smp\_mb() vs. synchronize\_irq() in the
code comment (Chris)
v3:

HID: wacom: Report ABS\_MISC event for Cintiq Companion Hybrid
commit 33e5df0e0e32027866e9fb00451952998fc957f2 upstream.
It appears that the Cintiq Companion Hybrid does not send an ABS\_MISC event to
userspace when any of its ExpressKeys are pressed. This is not strictly
necessary now that the pad exists on its own device, but should be fixed for
consistency's sake.
Traditionally both the stylus and pad shared the same device node, and
xf86-input-wacom would use ABS\_MISC for disambiguation. Not sending this causes
the Hybrid to behave incorrectly with xf86-input-wacom beginning with its
8f44f3 commit.

HID: input: fix confusion on conflicting mappings
commit 6ce901eb61aa30ba8565c62049ee80c90728ef14 upstream.
On an PC-101/103/104 keyboard (American layout) the 'Enter' key and its
neighbours look like this:
+---+ +---+ +-------+
| 1 | | 2 | | 5 |
+---+ +---+ +-------+
+---+ +-----------+
| 3 | | 4 |
+---+ +-----------+
On a PC-102/105 keyboard (European layout) it looks like this:
+---+ +---+ +-------+
| 1 | | 2 | | |
+---+ +---+ +-+ 4 |
+---+ +---+ | |
| 3 | | 5 | | |
+---+ +---+ +-----+
(Note that the number of keys is the same, but key '5' is moved down and
the shape of key '4' is changed. Keys '1' to '3' are exactly the same.)
The keys 1-4 report the same scan-code in HID in both layouts, even though
the keysym they produce is usually different depending on the XKB-keymap
used by user-space.
However, key '5' (US 'backslash'/'pipe') reports 0x31 for the upper layout
and 0x32 for the lower layout, as defined by the HID spec. This is highly
confusing as the linux-input API uses a single keycode for both.
So far, this was never a problem as there never has been a keyboard with
both of those keys present at the same time. It would have to look
something like this:
+---+ +---+ +-------+
| 1 | | 2 | | x31 |
+---+ +---+ +-------+
+---+ +---+ +-----+
| 3 | |x32| | 4 |
+---+ +---+ +-----+
HID can represent such a keyboard, but the linux-input API cannot.
Furthermore, any user-space mapping would be confused by this and,
luckily, no-one ever produced such hardware.
Now, the HID input layer fixed this mess by mapping both 0x31 and 0x32 to
the same keycode (KEY\_BACKSLASH==0x2b). As only one of both physical keys
is present on a hardware, this works just fine.
Lets introduce hardware-vendors into this:
------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, it seems way to expensive to produce a different device for
American and European layouts. Therefore, hardware-vendors put both keys,
(0x31 and 0x32) on the same keyboard, but only one of them is hooked up
to the physical button, the other one is 'dead'.
This means, they can use the same hardware, with a different button-layout
and automatically produce the correct HID events for American \*and\*
European layouts. This is unproblematic for normal keyboards, as the
'dead' key will never report any KEY-DOWN events. But RollOver keyboards
send the whole matrix on each key-event, allowing n-key roll-over mode.
This means, we get a 0x31 and 0x32 event on each key-press. One of them
will always be 0, the other reports the real state. As we map both to the
same keycode, we will get spurious key-events, even though the real
key-state never changed.
The easiest way would be to blacklist 'dead' keys and never handle those.
We could simply read the 'country' tag of USB devices and blacklist either
key according to the layout. But... hardware vendors... want the same
device for all countries and thus many of them set 'country' to 0 for all
devices. Meh..
So we have to deal with this properly. As we cannot know which of the keys
is 'dead', we either need a heuristic and track those keys, or we simply
make use of our value-tracking for HID fields. We simply ignore HID events
for absolute data if the data didn't change. As HID tracks events on the
HID level, we haven't done the keycode translation, yet. Therefore, the
'dead' key is tracked independently of the real key, therefore, any events
on it will be ignored.
This patch simply discards any HID events for absolute data if it didn't
change compared to the last report. We need to ignore relative and
buffered-byte reports for obvious reasons. But those cannot be affected by
this bug, so we're fine.
Preferably, we'd do this filtering on the HID-core level. But this might
break a lot of custom drivers, if they do not follow the HID specs.
Therefore, we do this late in hid-input just before we inject it into the
input layer (which does the exact same filtering, but on the keycode
level).
If this turns out to break some devices, we might have to limit filtering
to EV\_KEY events. But lets try to do the Right Thing first, and properly
filter any absolute data that didn't change.
This patch is tagged for 'stable' as it fixes a lot of n-key RollOver
hardware. We might wanna wait with backporting for a while, before we know
it doesn't break anything else, though.

staging: comedi: cb\_pcidas64: fix incorrect AI range code handling
commit be8e89087ec2d2c8a1ad1e3db64bf4efdfc3c298 upstream.
The hardware range code values and list of valid ranges for the AI
subdevice is incorrect for several supported boards. The hardware range
code values for all boards except PCI-DAS4020/12 is determined by
calling `ai\_range\_bits\_6xxx()` based on the maximum voltage of the range
and whether it is bipolar or unipolar, however it only returns the
correct hardware range code for the PCI-DAS60xx boards. For
PCI-DAS6402/16 (and /12) it returns the wrong code for the unipolar
ranges. For PCI-DAS64/Mx/16 it returns the wrong code for all the
ranges and the comedi range table is incorrect.
Change `ai\_range\_bits\_6xxx()` to use a look-up table pointed to by new
member `ai\_range\_codes` of `struct pcidas64\_board` to map the comedi
range table indices to the hardware range codes. Use a new comedi range
table for the PCI-DAS64/Mx/16 boards (and the commented out variants).

firmware: dmi\_scan: Fix dmi scan to handle "End of Table" structure
commit ce204e9a4bd82e9e6e7479bca8057e45aaac5c42 upstream.
The dmi-sysfs should create "End of Table" entry, that is type 127. But
after adding initial SMBIOS v3 support fc43026278b2 ("dmi: add support
for SMBIOS 3.0 64-bit entry point") the 127-0 entry is not handled any
more, as result it's not created in dmi sysfs for instance. This is
important because the size of whole DMI table must correspond to sum of
all DMI entry sizes.
So move the end-of-table check after it's handled by dmi\_table.

According to SMBIOSv3 specification the length of DMI table can be

It's obvious that dmi\_num theoretically can be more than u16 also,
so it's can be changed to u32 or at least it's better to use int
instead of u16, but on that moment I cannot imagine dmi structure

dm snapshot: fix a possible invalid memory access on unload
commit 22aa66a3ee5b61e0f4a0bfeabcaa567861109ec3 upstream.
When the snapshot target is unloaded, snapshot\_dtr() waits until
pending\_exceptions\_count drops to zero. Then, it destroys the snapshot.
Therefore, the function that decrements pending\_exceptions\_count
should not touch the snapshot structure after the decrement.
pending\_complete() calls free\_pending\_exception(), which decrements
pending\_exceptions\_count, and then it performs up\_write(&s->lock) and it
calls retry\_origin\_bios() which dereferences s->origin. These two
memory accesses to the fields of the snapshot may touch the dm\_snapshot
struture after it is freed.
This patch moves the call to free\_pending\_exception() to the end of
pending\_complete(), so that the snapshot will not be destroyed while
pending\_complete() is in progress.

dm: fix a race condition in dm\_get\_md
commit 2bec1f4a8832e74ebbe859f176d8a9cb20dd97f4 upstream.
The function dm\_get\_md finds a device mapper device with a given dev\_t,
increases the reference count and returns the pointer.
dm\_get\_md calls dm\_find\_md, dm\_find\_md takes \_minor\_lock, finds the
device, tests that the device doesn't have DMF\_DELETING or DMF\_FREEING
flag, drops \_minor\_lock and returns pointer to the device. dm\_get\_md then
calls dm\_get. dm\_get calls BUG if the device has the DMF\_FREEING flag,
otherwise it increments the reference count.
There is a possible race condition - after dm\_find\_md exits and before
dm\_get is called, there are no locks held, so the device may disappear or
DMF\_FREEING flag may be set, which results in BUG.
To fix this bug, we need to call dm\_get while we hold \_minor\_lock. This
patch renames dm\_find\_md to dm\_get\_md and changes it so that it calls
dm\_get while holding the lock.

dm io: reject unsupported DISCARD requests with EOPNOTSUPP
commit 37527b869207ad4c208b1e13967d69b8bba1fbf9 upstream.
I created a dm-raid1 device backed by a device that supports DISCARD
and another device that does NOT support DISCARD with the following
dm configuration:
# echo '0 2048 mirror core 1 512 2 /dev/sda 0 /dev/sdb 0' | dmsetup create moo
# lsblk -D
NAME DISC-ALN DISC-GRAN DISC-MAX DISC-ZERO
sda 0 4K 1G 0
`-moo (dm-0) 0 4K 1G 0
sdb 0 0B 0B 0
`-moo (dm-0) 0 4K 1G 0
Notice that the mirror device /dev/mapper/moo advertises DISCARD
support even though one of the mirror halves doesn't.
If I issue a DISCARD request (via fstrim, mount -o discard, or ioctl
BLKDISCARD) through the mirror, kmirrord gets stuck in an infinite
loop in do\_region() when it tries to issue a DISCARD request to sdb.
The problem is that when we call do\_region() against sdb, num\_sectors
is set to zero because q->limits.max\_discard\_sectors is zero.
Therefore, "remaining" never decreases and the loop never terminates.
To fix this: before entering the loop, check for the combination of
REQ\_DISCARD and no discard and return -EOPNOTSUPP to avoid hanging up
the mirror device.
This bug was found by the unfortunate coincidence of pvmove and a
discard operation in the RHEL 6.5 kernel; upstream is also affected.

It may be possible that a device claims discard support but it rejects
discards with -EOPNOTSUPP. It happens when using loopback on ext2/ext3

If discard error happens, we reject the bio with -EOPNOTSUPP, but we do
not degrade the array.

staging: comedi: comedi\_compat32.c: fix COMEDI\_CMD copy back
commit 42b8ce6f55facfa101462e694d33fc6bca471138 upstream.
`do\_cmd\_ioctl()` in "comedi\_fops.c" handles the `COMEDI\_CMD` ioctl.
This returns `-EAGAIN` if it has copied a modified `struct comedi\_cmd`
back to user-space. (This occurs when the low-level Comedi driver's
`do\_cmdtest()` handler returns non-zero to indicate a problem with the
contents of the `struct comedi\_cmd`, or when the `struct comedi\_cmd` has
the `CMDF\_BOGUS` flag set.)
`compat\_cmd()` in "comedi\_compat32.c" handles the 32-bit compatible
version of the `COMEDI\_CMD` ioctl. Currently, it never copies a 32-bit
compatible version of `struct comedi\_cmd` back to user-space, which is
at odds with the way the regular `COMEDI\_CMD` ioctl is handled. To fix
it, change `compat\_cmd()` to copy a 32-bit compatible version of the
`struct comedi\_cmd` back to user-space when the main ioctl handler
returns `-EAGAIN`.

clk: Fix debugfs clk removal before inited
commit 52bba9809a954d72bc77773bd560b9724b495eb7 upstream.
Some of the clks can be registered & unregistered before the clk related debugfs
entries are initialized at late\_initcall. In the unregister path checking for only
dentry before clk\_debug\_init() would lead dangling pointers in the debug clk list,
because the list is already populated in register path and the clk pointer freed in
unregister path.
The side effect of not removing it from the list is either a null pointer
dereference or if lucky to boot the system, the number of clk entries in
debugfs disappear.
We could add more checks like if (inited && !clk->dentry) but just removing
the check for dentry made more sense as debugfs\_remove\_recursive() seems to be
safe with null pointers. This will ensure that the unregistering clk would be
removed from the debug list in all the code paths.
Without this patch kernel would crash with log:

nilfs2: fix potential memory overrun on inode
commit 957ed60b53b519064a54988c4e31e0087e47d091 upstream.
Each inode of nilfs2 stores a root node of a b-tree, and it turned out to
have a memory overrun issue:
Each b-tree node of nilfs2 stores a set of key-value pairs and the number
of them (in "bn\_nchildren" member of nilfs\_btree\_node struct), as well as
a few other "bn\_\*" members.
Since the value of "bn\_nchildren" is used for operations on the key-values
within the b-tree node, it can cause memory access overrun if a large
number is incorrectly set to "bn\_nchildren".
For instance, nilfs\_btree\_node\_lookup() function determines the range of
binary search with it, and too large "bn\_nchildren" leads
nilfs\_btree\_node\_get\_key() in that function to overrun.
As for intermediate b-tree nodes, this is prevented by a sanity check
performed when each node is read from a drive, however, no sanity check
has been done for root nodes stored in inodes.
This patch fixes the issue by adding missing sanity check against b-tree
root nodes so that it's called when on-memory inodes are read from ifile,
inode metadata file.

IB/core: Properly handle registration of on-demand paging MRs after dereg
commit 4fc701ead77ede96df3e8b3de13fdf2b1326ee5b upstream.
When the last on-demand paging MR is released the notifier count is
left non-zero so that concurrent page faults will have to abort. If a
new MR is then registered, the counter is reset. However, the decision
is made to put the new MR in the list waiting for the notifier count
to reach zero, before the counter is reset. An invalidation or another
MR registration can release the MR to handle page faults, but without
such an event the MR can wait forever.
The patch fixes this issue by adding a check whether the MR is the
first on-demand paging MR when deciding whether it is ready to handle
page faults. If it is the first MR, we know that there are no mmu
notifiers running in parallel to the registration.

When teardown process starts during live IO, we need to keep the
memory regions pool (frmr/fmr) until all in-flight tasks are properly
released, since each task may return a memory region to the pool. In
order to do this, we pass a destroy flag to iser\_free\_ib\_conn\_res to
indicate we can destroy the device and the memory regions
pool. iser\_conn\_release will pass it as true and also DEVICE\_REMOVAL
event (we need to let the device to properly remove).
Also, Since we conditionally call iser\_free\_rx\_descriptors,
remove the extra check on iser\_conn->rx\_descs.

locking/rtmutex: Avoid a NULL pointer dereference on deadlock
commit 8d1e5a1a1ccf5ae9d8a5a0ee7960202ccb0c5429 upstream.
With task\_blocks\_on\_rt\_mutex() returning early -EDEADLK we never
add the waiter to the waitqueue. Later, we try to remove it via
remove\_waiter() and go boom in rt\_mutex\_top\_waiter() because
rb\_entry() gives a NULL pointer.
( Tested on v3.18-RT where rtmutex is used for regular mutex and I
tried to get one twice in a row. )
Not sure when this started but I guess 397335f004f4 ("rtmutex: Fix

ALSA: fireworks/bebob/dice/oxfw: allow stream destructor after releasing runtime
commit d23c2cc4485d10f0cedfef99dd2961d9652b1b3f upstream.
Currently stream destructor in each driver has a problem to be called in
a context in which sound card object is released, because the destructors
call amdtp\_stream\_pcm\_abort() and touch PCM runtime data.
The PCM runtime data is destroyed in application's context with
snd\_pcm\_close(), on the other hand PCM substream data is destroyed after
sound card object is released, in most case after all of ALSA character
devices are released. When PCM runtime is destroyed and PCM substream is
remained, amdtp\_stream\_pcm\_abort() touches PCM runtime data and causes
Null-pointer-dereference.
This commit changes stream destructors and allows each driver to call
it after releasing runtime.

commit 12ed719291a953d443921f9cdb0ffee41066c340 upstream.
Fireworks and Dice drivers try to touch instances of FireWire unit after
sound card object is released, while references to the unit is decremented
in .remove(). When unplugging during streaming, sound card object is
released after .remove(), thus Fireworks and Dice drivers causes GPF or
Null-pointer-dereferencing to application processes because an instance of
FireWire unit was already released.
This commit adds reference-counting for FireWire unit in drivers to allow
them to touch an instance of FireWire unit after .remove(). In most case,
any operations after .remove() may be failed safely.

tty: fix up atime/mtime mess, take four
commit f0bf0bd07943bfde8f5ac39a32664810a379c7d3 upstream.
This problem was taken care of three times already in
\* b0de59b5733d18b0d1974a060860a8b5c1b36a2e (TTY: do not update
atime/mtime on read/write),
\* 37b7f3c76595e23257f61bd80b223de8658617ee (TTY: fix atime/mtime
regression), and
\* b0b885657b6c8ef63a46bc9299b2a7715d19acde (tty: fix up atime/mtime
mess, take three)
But it still misses one point. As John Paul correctly points out, we
do not care about setting date. If somebody ever changes wall
time backwards (by mistake for example), tty timestamps are never
updated until the original wall time passes.
So check the absolute difference of times and if it large than "8
seconds or so", always update the time. That means we will update
immediatelly when changing time. Ergo, CAP\_SYS\_TIME can foul the
check, but it was always that way.
Thanks John for serving me this so nicely debugged.

ARC: Fix KSTK\_ESP()
commit 13648b0118a24f4fc76c34e6c7b6ccf447e46a2a upstream.
/proc//maps currently don't annotate stack vma with "[stack]"
This is because KSTK\_ESP ie expected to return usermode SP of tsk while
currently it returns the kernel mode SP of a sleeping tsk.
While the fix is trivial, we also need to adjust the ARC kernel stack

TTY: fix tty\_wait\_until\_sent on 64-bit machines
commit 79fbf4a550ed6a22e1ae1516113e6c7fa5d56a53 upstream.
Fix overflow bug in tty\_wait\_until\_sent on 64-bit machines, where an
infinite timeout (0) would be passed to the underlying tty-driver's
wait\_until\_sent-operation as a negative timeout (-1), causing it to
return immediately.
This manifests itself for example as tcdrain() returning immediately,
drivers not honouring the drain flags when setting terminal attributes,
or even dropped data on close as a requested infinite closing-wait
timeout would be ignored.
The first symptom was reported by Asier LLANO who noted that tcdrain()
returned prematurely when using the ftdi\_sio usb-serial driver.
Fix this by passing 0 rather than MAX\_SCHEDULE\_TIMEOUT (LONG\_MAX) to the
underlying tty driver.
Note that the serial-core wait\_until\_sent-implementation is not affected
by this bug due to a lucky chance (comparison to an unsigned maximum
timeout), and neither is the cyclades one that had an explicit check for
negative timeouts, but all other tty drivers appear to be affected.

mac80211: Send EAPOL frames at lowest rate
commit 9c1c98a3bb7b7593b60264b9a07e001e68b46697 upstream.
The current minstrel\_ht rate control behavior is somewhat optimistic in
trying to find optimum TX rate. While this is usually fine for normal
Data frames, there are cases where a more conservative set of retry
parameters would be beneficial to make the connection more robust.
EAPOL frames are critical to the authentication and especially the
EAPOL-Key message 4/4 (the last message in the 4-way handshake) is
important to get through to the AP. If that message is lost, the only
recovery mechanism in many cases is to reassociate with the AP and start
from scratch. This can often be avoided by trying to send the frame with
more conservative rate and/or with more link layer retries.
In most cases, minstrel\_ht is currently using the initial EAPOL-Key
frames for probing higher rates and this results in only five link layer
transmission attempts (one at high(ish) MCS and four at MCS0). While
this works with most APs, it looks like there are some deployed APs that
may have issues with the EAPOL frames using HT MCS immediately after
association. Similarly, there may be issues in cases where the signal
strength or radio environment is not good enough to be able to get
frames through even at couple of MCS 0 tries.
The best approach for this would likely to be to reduce the TX rate for
the last rate (3rd rate parameter in the set) to a low basic rate (say,
6 Mbps on 5 GHz and 2 or 5.5 Mbps on 2.4 GHz), but doing that cleanly
requires some more effort. For now, we can start with a simple one-liner
that forces the minimum rate to be used for EAPOL frames similarly how
the TX rate is selected for the IEEE 802.11 Management frames. This does
result in a small extra latency added to the cases where the AP would be
able to receive the higher rate, but taken into account how small number
of EAPOL frames are used, this is likely to be insignificant. A future
optimization in the minstrel\_ht design can also allow this patch to be
reverted to get back to the more optimized initial TX rate.
It should also be noted that many drivers that do not use minstrel as
the rate control algorithm are already doing similar workarounds by
forcing the lowest TX rate to be used for EAPOL frames.

xhci: Workaround for PME stuck issues in Intel xhci
commit b8cb91e058cd0c0f02059c1207293c5b31d350fa upstream.
The xhci in Intel Sunrisepoint and Cherryview platforms need a driver
workaround for a Stuck PME that might either block PME events in suspend,
or create spurious PME events preventing runtime suspend.
Workaround is to clear a internal PME flag, BIT(28) in a vendor specific
PMCTRL register at offset 0x80a4, in both suspend resume callbacks
Without this, xhci connected usb devices might never be able to wake up the
system from suspend, or prevent device from going to suspend (xhci d3)

xhci: fix reporting of 0-sized URBs in control endpoint
commit 45ba2154d12fc43b70312198ec47085f10be801a upstream.
When a control transfer has a short data stage, the xHCI controller generates
two transfer events: a COMP\_SHORT\_TX event that specifies the untransferred
amount, and a COMP\_SUCCESS event. But when the data stage is not short, only the
COMP\_SUCCESS event occurs. Therefore, xhci-hcd must set urb->actual\_length to
urb->transfer\_buffer\_length while processing the COMP\_SUCCESS event, unless
urb->actual\_length was set already by a previous COMP\_SHORT\_TX event.
The driver checks this by seeing whether urb->actual\_length == 0, but this alone
is the wrong test, as it is entirely possible for a short transfer to have an
urb->actual\_length = 0.
This patch changes the xhci driver to rely on a new td->urb\_length\_set flag,
which is set to true when a COMP\_SHORT\_TX event is received and the URB length
updated at that stage.
This fixes a bug which affected the HSO plugin, which relies on URBs with
urb->actual\_length == 0 to halt re-submitting the RX URB in the control
endpoint.

usb: XHCI: platform: Move the Marvell quirks after the enabling the clocks
commit 1e7e4fb66489cc84366656ca5318f1cb61afd4ba upstream.
The commit 973747928514 ("usb: host: xhci-plat: add support for the Armada
375/38x XHCI controllers") extended the xhci-plat driver to support the Armada
375/38x SoCs, mostly by adding a quirk configuring the MBUS window.
However, that quirk was run before the clock the controllers needs has been
enabled. This usually worked because the clock was first enabled by the
bootloader, and left as such until the driver is probe, where it tries to
access the MBUS configuration registers before enabling the clock.
Things get messy when EPROBE\_DEFER is involved during the probe, since as part
of its error path, the driver will rightfully disable the clock. When the
driver will be reprobed, it will retry to access the MBUS registers, but this
time with the clock disabled, which hangs forever.
Fix this by running the quirks after the clock has been enabled by the driver.

usb: gadget: configfs: don't NUL-terminate (sub)compatible ids
commit a0456399fb07155637a2b597b91cc1c63bc25141 upstream.
The "Extended Compat ID OS Feature Descriptor Specification" does not
require the (sub)compatible ids to be NUL-terminated, because they
are placed in a fixed-size buffer and only unused parts of it should
contain NULs. If the buffer is fully utilized, there is no place for NULs.
Consequently, the code which uses desc->ext\_compat\_id never expects the
data contained to be NUL terminated.
If the compatible id is stored after sub-compatible id, and the compatible
id is full length (8 bytes), the (useless) NUL terminator overwrites the
first byte of the sub-compatible id.
If the sub-compatible id is full length (8 bytes), the (useless) NUL
terminator ends up out of the buffer. The situation can happen in the RNDIS
function, where the buffer is a part of struct f\_rndis\_opts. The next
member of struct f\_rndis\_opts is a mutex, so its first byte gets
overwritten. The said byte is a part of a mutex'es member which contains
the information on whether the muext is locked or not. This can lead to a
deadlock, because, in a configfs-composed gadget when a function is linked
into a configuration with config\_usb\_cfg\_link(), usb\_get\_function()
is called, which then calls rndis\_alloc(), which tries locking the same
mutex and (wrongly) finds it already locked.
This patch eliminates NUL terminating of the (sub)compatible id.

KVM: MIPS: Fix trace event to save PC directly
commit b3cffac04eca9af46e1e23560a8ee22b1bd36d43 upstream.
Currently the guest exit trace event saves the VCPU pointer to the
structure, and the guest PC is retrieved by dereferencing it when the
event is printed rather than directly from the trace record. This isn't
safe as the printing may occur long afterwards, after the PC has changed
and potentially after the VCPU has been freed. Usually this results in
the same (wrong) PC being printed for multiple trace events. It also
isn't portable as userland has no way to access the VCPU data structure
when interpreting the trace record itself.
Lets save the actual PC in the structure so that the correct value is
accessible later.

KVM: emulate: fix CMPXCHG8B on 32-bit hosts
commit 4ff6f8e61eb7f96d3ca535c6d240f863ccd6fb7d upstream.
This has been broken for a long time: it broke first in 2.6.35, then was
almost fixed in 2.6.36 but this one-liner slipped through the cracks.
The bug shows up as an infinite loop in Windows 7 (and newer) boot on
32-bit hosts without EPT.
Windows uses CMPXCHG8B to write to page tables, which causes a
page fault if running without EPT; the emulator is then called from
kvm\_mmu\_page\_fault. The loop then happens if the higher 4 bytes are
not 0; the common case for this is that the NX bit (bit 63) is 1.

Btrfs: fix data loss in the fast fsync path
commit 3a8b36f378060d20062a0918e99fae39ff077bf0 upstream.
When using the fast file fsync code path we can miss the fact that new
writes happened since the last file fsync and therefore return without
waiting for the IO to finish and write the new extents to the fsync log.
Here's an example scenario where the fsync will miss the fact that new
file data exists that wasn't yet durably persisted:
1. fs\_info->last\_trans\_committed == N - 1 and current transaction is
transaction N (fs\_info->generation == N);
2. do a buffered write;
3. fsync our inode, this clears our inode's full sync flag, starts
an ordered extent and waits for it to complete - when it completes
at btrfs\_finish\_ordered\_io(), the inode's last\_trans is set to the
value N (via btrfs\_update\_inode\_fallback -> btrfs\_update\_inode ->
btrfs\_set\_inode\_last\_trans);
4. transaction N is committed, so fs\_info->last\_trans\_committed is now
set to the value N and fs\_info->generation remains with the value N;
5. do another buffered write, when this happens btrfs\_file\_write\_iter
sets our inode's last\_trans to the value N + 1 (that is
fs\_info->generation + 1 == N + 1);
6. transaction N + 1 is started and fs\_info->generation now has the
value N + 1;
7. transaction N + 1 is committed, so fs\_info->last\_trans\_committed
is set to the value N + 1;
8. fsync our inode - because it doesn't have the full sync flag set,
we only start the ordered extent, we don't wait for it to complete
(only in a later phase) therefore its last\_trans field has the
value N + 1 set previously by btrfs\_file\_write\_iter(), and so we
have:
inode->last\_trans <= fs\_info->last\_trans\_committed
(N + 1) (N + 1)
Which made us not log the last buffered write and exit the fsync
handler immediately, returning success (0) to user space and resulting
in data loss after a crash.
This can actually be triggered deterministically and the following excerpt
from a testcase I made for xfstests triggers the issue. It moves a dummy
file across directories and then fsyncs the old parent directory - this
is just to trigger a transaction commit, so moving files around isn't
directly related to the issue but it was chosen because running 'sync' for
example does more than just committing the current transaction, as it
flushes/waits for all file data to be persisted. The issue can also happen
at random periods, since the transaction kthread periodicaly commits the
current transaction (about every 30 seconds by default).
The body of the test is:
\_scratch\_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
\_init\_flakey
\_mount\_flakey
# Create our main test file 'foo', the one we check for data loss.
# By doing an fsync against our file, it makes btrfs clear the 'needs\_full\_sync'
# bit from its flags (btrfs inode specific flags).
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 0 8K" \
-c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Now create one other file and 2 directories. We will move this second file
# from one directory to the other later because it forces btrfs to commit its
# currently open transaction if we fsync the old parent directory. This is
# necessary to trigger the data loss bug that affected btrfs.
mkdir $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_1
touch $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_1/bar
mkdir $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_2
# Make sure everything is durably persisted.
sync
# Write more 8Kb of data to our file.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xbb 8K 8K" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Move our 'bar' file into a new directory.
mv $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_1/bar $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_2/bar
# Fsync our first directory. Because it had a file moved into some other
# directory, this made btrfs commit the currently open transaction. This is
# a condition necessary to trigger the data loss bug.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/testdir\_1
# Now fsync our main test file. If the fsync succeeds, we expect the 8Kb of
# data we wrote previously to be persisted and available if a crash happens.
# This did not happen with btrfs, because of the transaction commit that
# happened when we fsynced the parent directory.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
# Simulate a crash/power loss.
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_DROP\_WRITES
\_unmount\_flakey
\_load\_flakey\_table $FLAKEY\_ALLOW\_WRITES
\_mount\_flakey
# Now check that all data we wrote before are available.
echo "File content after log replay:"
od -t x1 $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
status=0
exit
The expected golden output for the test, which is what we get with this
fix applied (or when running against ext3/4 and xfs), is:
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 0
XXX Bytes, X ops; XX:XX:XX.X (XXX YYY/sec and XXX ops/sec)
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 8192
XXX Bytes, X ops; XX:XX:XX.X (XXX YYY/sec and XXX ops/sec)
File content after log replay:
0000000 aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
\*
0020000 bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb
\*
0040000
Without this fix applied, the output shows the test file does not have
the second 8Kb extent that we successfully fsynced:
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 0
XXX Bytes, X ops; XX:XX:XX.X (XXX YYY/sec and XXX ops/sec)
wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 8192
XXX Bytes, X ops; XX:XX:XX.X (XXX YYY/sec and XXX ops/sec)
File content after log replay:
0000000 aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa
\*
0020000
So fix this by skipping the fsync only if we're doing a full sync and
if the inode's last\_trans is <= fs\_info->last\_trans\_committed, or if
the inode is already in the log. Also remove setting the inode's
last\_trans in btrfs\_file\_write\_iter since it's useless/unreliable.
Also because btrfs\_file\_write\_iter no longer sets inode->last\_trans to
fs\_info->generation + 1, don't set last\_trans to 0 if we bail out and don't
bail out if last\_trans is 0, otherwise something as simple as the following
example wouldn't log the second write on the last fsync:
1. write to file
2. fsync file
3. fsync file
|--> btrfs\_inode\_in\_log() returns true and it set last\_trans to 0
4. write to file
|--> btrfs\_file\_write\_iter() no longers sets last\_trans, so it
remained with a value of 0
5. fsync
|--> inode->last\_trans == 0, so it bails out without logging the
second write
A test case for xfstests will be sent soon.

Btrfs: fix fsync race leading to ordered extent memory leaks
commit 4d884fceaa2c838abb598778813e93f6d9fea723 upstream.
We can have multiple fsync operations against the same file during the
same transaction and they can collect the same ordered extents while they
don't complete (still accessible from the inode's ordered tree). If this
happens, those ordered extents will never get their reference counts
decremented to 0, leading to memory leaks and inode leaks (an iput for an
ordered extent's inode is scheduled only when the ordered extent's refcount
drops to 0). The following sequence diagram explains this race:
CPU 1 CPU 2
btrfs\_sync\_file()
btrfs\_sync\_file()
mutex\_lock(inode->i\_mutex)
btrfs\_log\_inode()
btrfs\_get\_logged\_extents()
--> collects ordered extent X
--> increments ordered
extent X's refcount
btrfs\_submit\_logged\_extents()
mutex\_unlock(inode->i\_mutex)
mutex\_lock(inode->i\_mutex)
btrfs\_sync\_log()
btrfs\_wait\_logged\_extents()
--> list\_del\_init(&ordered->log\_list)
btrfs\_log\_inode()
btrfs\_get\_logged\_extents()
--> Adds ordered extent X
to logged\_list because
at this point:
list\_empty(&ordered->log\_list)
&& test\_bit(BTRFS\_ORDERED\_LOGGED,
&ordered->flags) == 0
--> Increments ordered extent
X's refcount
--> check if ordered extent's io is
finished or not, start it if
necessary and wait for it to finish
--> sets bit BTRFS\_ORDERED\_LOGGED
on ordered extent X's flags
and adds it to trans->ordered
btrfs\_sync\_log() finishes
btrfs\_submit\_logged\_extents()
btrfs\_log\_inode() finishes
mutex\_unlock(inode->i\_mutex)
btrfs\_sync\_file() finishes
btrfs\_sync\_log()
btrfs\_wait\_logged\_extents()
--> Sees ordered extent X has the
bit BTRFS\_ORDERED\_LOGGED set in
its flags
--> X's refcount is untouched
btrfs\_sync\_log() finishes
btrfs\_sync\_file() finishes
btrfs\_commit\_transaction()
--> called by transaction kthread for e.g.
btrfs\_wait\_pending\_ordered()
--> waits for ordered extent X to
complete
--> decrements ordered extent X's
refcount by 1 only, corresponding
to the increment done by the fsync
task ran by CPU 1
In the scenario of the above diagram, after the transaction commit,
the ordered extent will remain with a refcount of 1 forever, leaking
the ordered extent structure and preventing the i\_count of its inode
from ever decreasing to 0, since the delayed iput is scheduled only
when the ordered extent's refcount drops to 0, preventing the inode
from ever being evicted by the VFS.
Fix this by using the flag BTRFS\_ORDERED\_LOGGED differently. Use it to
mean that an ordered extent is already being processed by an fsync call,
which will attach it to the current transaction, preventing it from being
collected by subsequent fsync operations against the same inode.
This race was introduced with the following change (added in 3.19 and
backported to stable 3.18 and 3.17):

commit e765537add38cf7967efa11999bb5daf84a6517d upstream.
This reverts commit e0922e5e3ccb78aa0152e93dfbd1755ac39c8582.
Requested by Andrey Smirnov.
It incorrectly assumes that the level of indirection is not needed
which is not true(probably because the driver incorrectly allocates
sizeof(\*client) instead of sizeof(\*data) via devm\_iio\_device\_alloc).
If you look at the code of the probe function(see below) it is easy to
see that what is being stored in the private memory of the IIO device
instance is not a copy of a 'struct i2c\_client' but a pointer to an
instance passed as an argument to the probe function.
struct i2c\_client \*\*data;
int ret;
< Some code skipped >
indio\_dev = devm\_iio\_device\_alloc(&client->dev, sizeof(\*client));
if (!indio\_dev)
return -ENOMEM;
data = iio\_priv(indio\_dev);
\*data = client;
Without reverting this change any read of a raw value of this sensor
leads to a kernel oops due to a NULL pointer de-reference on my
hardware setup.

IIO: si7020: Allocate correct amount of memory in devm\_iio\_device\_alloc
commit e01becbad300712a28f29b666e685536f45e83bc upstream.
Since only a pointer to struct i2c\_client is stored in a private area
of IIO device created by the driver there's no need to allocate
sizeof(struct i2c\_client) worth of storage.
Pushed to stable as this is linked to the revert patch previously.
Without this followup the original patch looks sensible.

iio: mxs-lradc: only update the buffer when its conversions have finished
commit 89bb35e200bee745c539a96666e0792301ca40f1 upstream.
Using the touchscreen while running buffered capture results in the
buffer reporting lots of wrong values, often just zeros. This is because
we push readings to the buffer every time a touchscreen interrupt
arrives, including when the buffer's own conversions have not yet
finished. So let's only push to the buffer when its conversions are
ready.

iio: mxs-lradc: make ADC reads not unschedule touchscreen conversions
commit 6abe0300a1d5242f4ff89257197f284679af1a06 upstream.
Reading a channel through sysfs, or starting a buffered capture, can
occasionally turn off the touchscreen.
This is because the read\_raw() and buffer preenable()/postdisable()
callbacks unschedule current conversions on all channels. If a delay
channel happens to schedule a touchscreen conversion at the same time,
the conversion gets cancelled and the touchscreen sequence stops.
This is probably related to this note from the reference manual:
"If a delay group schedules channels to be sampled and a manual
write to the schedule field in CTRL0 occurs while the block is
discarding samples, the LRADC will switch to the new schedule
and will not sample the channels that were previously scheduled.
The time window for this to happen is very small and lasts only
while the LRADC is discarding samples."
So make the callbacks only unschedule conversions for the channels they
use. This means channel 0 for read\_raw() and channels 0-5 for the buffer
(if the touchscreen is enabled). Since the touchscreen uses different
channels (6 and 7), it no longer gets turned off.
This is tested and fixes the issue on i.MX28, but hasn't been tested on
i.MX23.

iio: mxs-lradc: separate touchscreen and buffer virtual channels
commit f81197b8a31b8fb287ae57f597b5b6841e1ece92 upstream.
The touchscreen was initially designed [1] to map all of its physical
channels to one virtual channel, leaving buffered capture to use the
remaining 7 virtual channels. When the touchscreen was reimplemented
[2], it was made to use four virtual channels, which overlap and
conflict with the channels the buffer uses.
As a result, when the buffer is enabled, the touchscreen's virtual
channels are remapped to whichever physical channels the buffer was
configured with, causing the touchscreen to read those instead of the
touch measurement channels. Effectively the touchscreen stops working.
So here we separate the channels again, giving the touchscreen 2 virtual
channels and the buffer 6. We can't give the touchscreen just 1 channel
as before, as the current pressure calculation requires 2 channels to be
read at the same time.
This makes the touchscreen continue to work during buffered capture. It
has been tested on i.MX28, but not on i.MX23.

Commit:
f31a9f7c7169 ("x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area")

adb9d526e982 ("x86/xsaves: Add xsaves and xrstors support for booting time")

Unfortunately both failed to properly protect them against faulting:
The 'xstate\_fault' macro will use the closest label named '1'
backward and that ends up in the .altinstr\_replacement section
rather than in .text. This means that the kernel will never find
in the \_\_ex\_table the .text address where this instruction might
fault, leading to serious problems if userspace manages to
trigger the fault.

It changes core\_scsi3\_update\_and\_write\_aptpl() to use vzalloc'ed

It also adds logic in core\_scsi3\_update\_and\_write\_aptpl() to double
the original length upon core\_scsi3\_update\_aptpl\_buf() failure, and
retries until the vzalloc'ed buffer is large enough to accommodate
the outgoing APTPL metadata.

drm/i915: Correct the IOSF Dev\_FN field for IOSF transfers
commit d180d2bbb66579e3bf449642b8ec2a76f4014fcd upstream.
As per the specififcation, the SB\_DevFn is the PCI\_DEVFN of the target
device and not the source. So PCI\_DEVFN(2,0) is not correct. Further the
port ID should be enough to identify devices unless they are MFD. The
SB\_DevFn was intended to remove ambiguity in case of these MFD devices.
For non MFD devices the recommendation for the target device IP was to
ignore these fields, but not all of them followed the recommendation.
Some like CCK ignore these fields and hence PCI\_DEVFN(2, 0) works and so
does PCI\_DEVFN(0, 0) as it works for DPIO. The issue came to light because
of GPIONC which was not getting programmed correctly with PCI\_DEVFN(2, 0).
It turned out that this did not follow the recommendation and expected 0
in this field.
In general the recommendation is to use SB\_DevFn as PCI\_DEVFN(0, 0) for
all devices except target PCI devices.

mm: page\_alloc: revert inadvertent !\_\_GFP\_FS retry behavior change
commit cc87317726f851531ae8422e0c2d3d6e2d7b1955 upstream.
Historically, !\_\_GFP\_FS allocations were not allowed to invoke the OOM
killer once reclaim had failed, but nevertheless kept looping in the
allocator.
Commit 9879de7373fc ("mm: page\_alloc: embed OOM killing naturally into
allocation slowpath"), which should have been a simple cleanup patch,
accidentally changed the behavior to aborting the allocation at that
point. This creates problems with filesystem callers (?) that currently
rely on the allocator waiting for other tasks to intervene.
Revert the behavior as it shouldn't have been changed as part of a
cleanup patch.

mm/nommu: fix memory leak
commit da616534ed7f6e8ffaab699258b55c8d78d0b4ea upstream.
Maxime reported the following memory leak regression due to commit
dbc8358c7237 ("mm/nommu: use alloc\_pages\_exact() rather than its own
implementation").
On v3.19, I am facing a memory leak. Each time I run a command one page
is lost. Here an example with busybox's free command:

Unable to allocate RAM for process text/data, errno 12 SEGV
This problem happens because we allocate ordered page through
\_\_get\_free\_pages() in do\_mmap\_private() in some cases and we try to free
individual pages rather than ordered page in free\_page\_series(). In
this case, freeing pages whose refcount is not 0 won't be freed to the
page allocator so memory leak happens.
To fix the problem, this patch changes \_\_get\_free\_pages() to
alloc\_pages\_exact() since alloc\_pages\_exact() returns
physically-contiguous pages but each pages are refcounted.

mm: fix negative nr\_isolated counts
commit ff59909a077b3c51c168cb658601c6b63136a347 upstream.
The vmstat interfaces are good at hiding negative counts (at least when
CONFIG\_SMP); but if you peer behind the curtain, you find that
nr\_isolated\_anon and nr\_isolated\_file soon go negative, and grow ever
more negative: so they can absorb larger and larger numbers of isolated
pages, yet still appear to be zero.
I'm happy to avoid a congestion\_wait() when too\_many\_isolated() myself;
but I guess it's there for a good reason, in which case we ought to get
too\_many\_isolated() working again.
The imbalance comes from isolate\_migratepages()'s ISOLATE\_ABORT case:
putback\_movable\_pages() decrements the NR\_ISOLATED counts, but we forgot
to call acct\_isolated() to increment them.
It is possible that the bug whcih this patch fixes could cause OOM kills
when the system still has a lot of reclaimable page cache.

mm: hwpoison: drop lru\_add\_drain\_all() in \_\_soft\_offline\_page()
commit 9ab3b598d2dfbdb0153ffa7e4b1456bbff59a25d upstream.
A race condition starts to be visible in recent mmotm, where a PG\_hwpoison
flag is set on a migration source page \*before\* it's back in buddy page
poo= l.
This is problematic because no page flag is supposed to be set when
freeing (see \_\_free\_one\_page().) So the user-visible effect of this race
is that it could trigger the BUG\_ON() when soft-offlining is called.
The root cause is that we call lru\_add\_drain\_all() to make sure that the
page is in buddy, but that doesn't work because this function just
schedule= s a work item and doesn't wait its completion.
drain\_all\_pages() does drainin= g directly, so simply dropping
lru\_add\_drain\_all() solves this problem.

For whatever reason, generic\_access\_phys() only remaps one page, but
actually allows to access arbitrary size. It's quite easy to trigger
large reads, like printing out large structure with gdb, which leads to a
crash. Fix it by remapping correct size.

mm/compaction: fix wrong order check in compact\_finished()
commit 372549c2a3778fd3df445819811c944ad54609ca upstream.
What we want to check here is whether there is highorder freepage in buddy
list of other migratetype in order to steal it without fragmentation.
But, current code just checks cc->order which means allocation request
order. So, this is wrong.
Without this fix, non-movable synchronous compaction below pageblock order
would not stopped until compaction is complete, because migratetype of
most pageblocks are movable and high order freepage made by compaction is
usually on movable type buddy list.
There is some report related to this bug. See below link.
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mm/msg81666.html
Although the issued system still has load spike comes from compaction,
this makes that system completely stable and responsive according to his
report.
stress-highalloc test in mmtests with non movable order 7 allocation
doesn't show any notable difference in allocation success rate, but, it
shows more compaction success rate.
Compaction success rate (Compaction success \* 100 / Compaction stalls, %)

mm/nommu.c: fix arithmetic overflow in \_\_vm\_enough\_memory()
commit 8138a67a5557ffea3a21dfd6f037842d4e748513 upstream.
I noticed that "allowed" can easily overflow by falling below 0, because
(total\_vm / 32) can be larger than "allowed". The problem occurs in
OVERCOMMIT\_NONE mode.
In this case, a huge allocation can success and overcommit the system
(despite OVERCOMMIT\_NONE mode). All subsequent allocations will fall
(system-wide), so system become unusable.
The problem was masked out by commit c9b1d0981fcc
("mm: limit growth of 3% hardcoded other user reserve"),
but it's easy to reproduce it on older kernels:
1) set overcommit\_memory sysctl to 2
2) mmap() large file multiple times (with VM\_SHARED flag)
3) try to malloc() large amount of memory
It also can be reproduced on newer kernels, but miss-configured
sysctl\_user\_reserve\_kbytes is required.
Fix this issue by switching to signed arithmetic here.

mm: when stealing freepages, also take pages created by splitting buddy page
commit 99592d598eca62bdbbf62b59941c189176dfc614 upstream.
When studying page stealing, I noticed some weird looking decisions in
try\_to\_steal\_freepages(). The first I assume is a bug (Patch 1), the
following two patches were driven by evaluation.
Testing was done with stress-highalloc of mmtests, using the
mm\_page\_alloc\_extfrag tracepoint and postprocessing to get counts of how
often page stealing occurs for individual migratetypes, and what
migratetypes are used for fallbacks. Arguably, the worst case of page
stealing is when UNMOVABLE allocation steals from MOVABLE pageblock.
RECLAIMABLE allocation stealing from MOVABLE allocation is also not ideal,
so the goal is to minimize these two cases.
The evaluation of v2 wasn't always clear win and Joonsoo questioned the
results. Here I used different baseline which includes RFC compaction
improvements from [1]. I found that the compaction improvements reduce
variability of stress-highalloc, so there's less noise in the data.
First, let's look at stress-highalloc configured to do sync compaction,
and how these patches reduce page stealing events during the test. First
column is after fresh reboot, other two are reiterations of test without
reboot. That was all accumulater over 5 re-iterations (so the benchmark
was run 5x3 times with 5 fresh restarts).

In v2 we've seen apparent regression with Patch 1 for unmovable events,
this is now gone, suggesting it was indeed noise. Here, each patch
improves the situation for unmovable events. Reclaimable is improved by
patch 1 and then either the same modulo noise, or perhaps sligtly worse -
a small price for unmovable improvements, IMHO. The number of movable
allocations falling back to other migratetypes is most noisy, but it's
reduced to half at Patch 2 nevertheless. These are least critical as
compaction can move them around.
If we look at success rates, the patches don't affect them, that didn't change.

As with v2, /proc/pagetypeinfo appears unaffected with respect to numbers
of unmovable and reclaimable pageblocks.
Configuring the benchmark to allocate like THP page fault (i.e. no sync
compaction) gives much noisier results for iterations 2 and 3 after
reboot. This is not so surprising given how [1] offers lower improvements
in this scenario due to less restarts after deferred compaction which
would change compaction pivot.

The improvements for first iteration are clear, the rest is much noisier
and can appear like regression for Patch 1. Anyway, patch 2 rectifies it.
Allocation success rates are again unaffected so there's no point in
making this e-mail any longer.
[1] http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=142166196321125&w=2
This patch (of 3):
When \_\_rmqueue\_fallback() is called to allocate a page of order X, it will
find a page of order Y >= X of a fallback migratetype, which is different
from the desired migratetype. With the help of try\_to\_steal\_freepages(),
it may change the migratetype (to the desired one) also of:
1) all currently free pages in the pageblock containing the fallback page
2) the fallback pageblock itself
3) buddy pages created by splitting the fallback page (when Y > X)
These decisions take the order Y into account, as well as the desired
migratetype, with the goal of preventing multiple fallback allocations
that could e.g. distribute UNMOVABLE allocations among multiple
pageblocks.
Originally, decision for 1) has implied the decision for 3). Commit
47118af076f6 ("mm: mmzone: MIGRATE\_CMA migration type added") changed that
(probably unintentionally) so that the buddy pages in case 3) are always
changed to the desired migratetype, except for CMA pageblocks.
Commit fef903efcf0c ("mm/page\_allo.c: restructure free-page stealing code
and fix a bug") did some refactoring and added a comment that the case of
3) is intended. Commit 0cbef29a7821 ("mm: \_\_rmqueue\_fallback() should
respect pageblock type") removed the comment and tried to restore the
original behavior where 1) implies 3), but due to the previous
refactoring, the result is instead that only 2) implies 3) - and the
conditions for 2) are less frequently met than conditions for 1). This
may increase fragmentation in situations where the code decides to steal
all free pages from the pageblock (case 1)), but then gives back the buddy
pages produced by splitting.
This patch restores the original intended logic where 1) implies 3).
During testing with stress-highalloc from mmtests, this has shown to
decrease the number of events where UNMOVABLE and RECLAIMABLE allocations
steal from MOVABLE pageblocks, which can lead to permanent fragmentation.
In some cases it has increased the number of events when MOVABLE
allocations steal from UNMOVABLE or RECLAIMABLE pageblocks, but these are
fixable by sync compaction and thus less harmful.
Note that evaluation has shown that the behavior introduced by
47118af076f6 for buddy pages in case 3) is actually even better than the
original logic, so the following patch will introduce it properly once
again. For stable backports of this patch it makes thus sense to only fix
versions containing 0cbef29a7821.

Commit ed4d4902ebdd ("mm, hugetlb: remove hugetlb\_zero and

leading to out-of-bounds access in proc\_doulongvec\_minmax(). Use
'.extra1 = NULL' instead of '.extra1 = &zero'. Passing NULL is
equivalent to passing minimal value, which is 0 for unsigned types.

If \_\_unmap\_hugepage\_range() tries to unmap the address range over which

There is a race condition between hugepage migration and
change\_protection(), where hugetlb\_change\_protection() doesn't care about
migration entries and wrongly overwrites them. That causes unexpected
results like kernel crash. HWPoison entries also can cause the same
problem.
This patch adds is\_hugetlb\_entry\_(migration|hwpoisoned) check in this

mm/hugetlb: fix getting refcount 0 page in hugetlb\_fault()
commit 0f792cf949a0be506c2aa8bfac0605746b146dda upstream.
When running the test which causes the race as shown in the previous patch,
we can hit the BUG "get\_page() on refcount 0 page" in hugetlb\_fault().
This race happens when pte turns into migration entry just after the first
check of is\_hugetlb\_entry\_migration() in hugetlb\_fault() passed with false.
To fix this, we need to check pte\_present() again after huge\_ptep\_get().
This patch also reorders taking ptl and doing pte\_page(), because
pte\_page() should be done in ptl. Due to this reordering, we need use
trylock\_page() in page != pagecache\_page case to respect locking order.

net: ping: Return EAFNOSUPPORT when appropriate.
[ Upstream commit 9145736d4862145684009d6a72a6e61324a9439e ]
1. For an IPv4 ping socket, ping\_check\_bind\_addr does not check
the family of the socket address that's passed in. Instead,
make it behave like inet\_bind, which enforces either that the
address family is AF\_INET, or that the family is AF\_UNSPEC and
the address is 0.0.0.0.
2. For an IPv6 ping socket, ping\_check\_bind\_addr returns EINVAL
if the socket family is not AF\_INET6. Return EAFNOSUPPORT
instead, for consistency with inet6\_bind.
3. Make ping\_v4\_sendmsg and ping\_v6\_sendmsg return EAFNOSUPPORT
instead of EINVAL if an incorrect socket address structure is
passed in.
4. Make IPv6 ping sockets be IPv6-only. The code does not support
IPv4, and it cannot easily be made to support IPv4 because
the protocol numbers for ICMP and ICMPv6 are different. This
makes connect(::ffff:192.0.2.1) fail with EAFNOSUPPORT instead
of making the socket unusable.
Among other things, this fixes an oops that can be triggered by:
int s = socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_DGRAM, IPPROTO\_ICMP);
struct sockaddr\_in6 sin6 = {
.sin6\_family = AF\_INET6,
.sin6\_addr = in6addr\_any,
};
bind(s, (struct sockaddr \*) &sin6, sizeof(sin6));

udp: only allow UFO for packets from SOCK\_DGRAM sockets
[ Upstream commit acf8dd0a9d0b9e4cdb597c2f74802f79c699e802 ]
If an over-MTU UDP datagram is sent through a SOCK\_RAW socket to a
UFO-capable device, ip\_ufo\_append\_data() sets skb->ip\_summed to
CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL unconditionally as all GSO code assumes transport layer
checksum is to be computed on segmentation. However, in this case,
skb->csum\_start and skb->csum\_offset are never set as raw socket
transmit path bypasses udp\_send\_skb() where they are usually set. As a
result, driver may access invalid memory when trying to calculate the
checksum and store the result (as observed in virtio\_net driver).
Moreover, the very idea of modifying the userspace provided UDP header
is IMHO against raw socket semantics (I wasn't able to find a document
clearly stating this or the opposite, though). And while allowing
CHECKSUM\_NONE in the UFO case would be more efficient, it would be a bit
too intrusive change just to handle a corner case like this. Therefore
disallowing UFO for packets from SOCK\_DGRAM seems to be the best option.

sh\_eth: Fix lost MAC address on kexec
[ Upstream commit a14c7d15ca91b444e77df08b916befdce77562ab ]
Commit 740c7f31c094703c ("sh\_eth: Ensure DMA engines are stopped before
freeing buffers") added a call to sh\_eth\_reset() to the
sh\_eth\_set\_ringparam() and sh\_eth\_close() paths.
However, setting the software reset bit(s) in the EDMR register resets
the MAC Address Registers to zero. Hence after kexec, the new kernel
doesn't detect a valid MAC address and assigns a random MAC address,
breaking DHCP.
Set the MAC address again after the reset in sh\_eth\_dev\_exit() to fix
this.
Tested on r8a7740/armadillo (GETHER) and r8a7791/koelsch (FAST\_RCAR).

macvtap: make sure neighbour code can push ethernet header
[ Upstream commit 2f1d8b9e8afa5a833d96afcd23abcb8cdf8d83ab ]
Brian reported crashes using IPv6 traffic with macvtap/veth combo.
I tracked the crashes in neigh\_hh\_output()
-> memcpy(skb->data - HH\_DATA\_MOD, hh->hh\_data, HH\_DATA\_MOD);
Neighbour code assumes headroom to push Ethernet header is
at least 16 bytes.
It appears macvtap has only 14 bytes available on arches
where NET\_IP\_ALIGN is 0 (like x86)
Effect is a corruption of 2 bytes right before skb->head,
and possible crashes if accessing non existing memory.
This fix should also increase IPv4 performance, as paranoid code
in ip\_finish\_output2() wont have to call skb\_realloc\_headroom()

net: compat: Ignore MSG\_CMSG\_COMPAT in compat\_sys\_{send, recv}msg
[ Upstream commit d720d8cec563ce4e4fa44a613d4f2dcb1caf2998 ]
With commit a7526eb5d06b (net: Unbreak compat\_sys\_{send,recv}msg), the
MSG\_CMSG\_COMPAT flag is blocked at the compat syscall entry points,
changing the kernel compat behaviour from the one before the commit it
was trying to fix (1be374a0518a, net: Block MSG\_CMSG\_COMPAT in
send(m)msg and recv(m)msg).
On 32-bit kernels (!CONFIG\_COMPAT), MSG\_CMSG\_COMPAT is 0 and the native
32-bit sys\_sendmsg() allows flag 0x80000000 to be set (it is ignored by
the kernel). However, on a 64-bit kernel, the compat ABI is different
with commit a7526eb5d06b.
This patch changes the compat\_sys\_{send,recv}msg behaviour to the one
prior to commit 1be374a0518a.
The problem was found running 32-bit LTP (sendmsg01) binary on an arm64
kernel. Arguably, LTP should not pass 0xffffffff as flags to sendmsg()
but the general rule is not to break user ABI (even when the user
behaviour is not entirely sane).

team: fix possible null pointer dereference in team\_handle\_frame
[ Upstream commit 57e595631904c827cfa1a0f7bbd7cc9a49da5745 ]
Currently following race is possible in team:
CPU0 CPU1
team\_port\_del
team\_upper\_dev\_unlink
priv\_flags &= ~IFF\_TEAM\_PORT
team\_handle\_frame
team\_port\_get\_rcu
team\_port\_exists
priv\_flags & IFF\_TEAM\_PORT == 0
return NULL (instead of port got
from rx\_handler\_data)
netdev\_rx\_handler\_unregister
The thing is that the flag is removed before rx\_handler is unregistered.
If team\_handle\_frame is called in between, team\_port\_exists returns 0
and team\_port\_get\_rcu will return NULL.
So do not check the flag here. It is guaranteed by netdev\_rx\_handler\_unregister
that team\_handle\_frame will always see valid rx\_handler\_data pointer.

openvswitch: Fix net exit.

Open vSwitch allows moving internal vport to different namespace
while still connected to the bridge. But when namespace deleted
OVS does not detach these vports, that results in dangling
pointer to netdevice which causes kernel panic as follows.
This issue is fixed by detaching all ovs ports from the deleted
namespace at net-exit.

The problem is when rtnl\_configure\_link() fails in rtnl\_newlink(),
we simply call unregister\_device(), but for stacked device like vlan,
we almost do nothing when we unregister the upper device, more work

ipv6: fix ipv6\_cow\_metrics for non DST\_HOST case
[ Upstream commit 3b4711757d7903ab6fa88a9e7ab8901b8227da60 ]
ipv6\_cow\_metrics() currently assumes only DST\_HOST routes require
dynamic metrics allocation from inetpeer. The assumption breaks
when ndisc discovered router with RTAX\_MTU and RTAX\_HOPLIMIT metric.
Refer to ndisc\_router\_discovery() in ndisc.c and note that dst\_metric\_set()
is called after the route is created.
This patch creates the metrics array (by calling dst\_cow\_metrics\_generic) in
ipv6\_cow\_metrics().
Test:
radvd.conf:
interface qemubr0
{
AdvLinkMTU 1300;
AdvCurHopLimit 30;
prefix fd00:face:face:face::/64
{
AdvOnLink on;
AdvAutonomous on;
AdvRouterAddr off;
};
};
Before:
[root@qemu1 ~]# ip -6 r show | egrep -v unreachable
fd00:face:face:face::/64 dev eth0 proto kernel metric 256 expires 27sec
fe80::/64 dev eth0 proto kernel metric 256
default via fe80::74df:d0ff:fe23:8ef2 dev eth0 proto ra metric 1024 expires 27sec
After:

The issue is that when do\_setvfinfo() is being called to set up a VF
through ndo handler, we could set corrupted data if the attribute length
is less than the size of the related structure itself.
The intent is exactly the opposite, namely to make sure to pass at least
data of minimum size of len.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2015-2672 for the vulnerability fixed by the
<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06>
commit.

The rest of this message can probably be skipped unless someone cares
about the details of why
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/20/17> was sent.

We had previously proposed
"<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324> ...
had security-relevant value even though it was later determined to be
mis-protecting." This was based on your earlier phrase of "ends up
protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting." We now understand
that "ends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting"
actually does not ever protect anything. If the "pointer to the
instruction which might fault" points to .altinstr_replacement, this
is completely useless for preventing denial-of-service attacks. More
generally, having the "pointer to the instruction which might fault"
point to .altinstr_replacement results in absolutely zero
security-relevant value. Thus, there isn't a second CVE ID.

>>   - a ... CVE id for the
>>     <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06>
>>     change

> The above commit is the fix, not a security issue.

This was just a question of commonly used, but imprecise, terminology.
In typical usage on the oss-security list, stating that a CVE ID is
for a commit means that the CVE ID is associated with the
vulnerability that the commit fixed. This imprecise terminology can
work poorly in situations where a commit fixed one security problem
but introduced a different security problem, or situations in which
there is a possible misinterpretation that that had happened.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204729#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-23 12:26:23 UTC  ``` Quentin Casasnovas reported on <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/877>: """ Jamie and I discovered there was a flaw in the way the xsave/xrstor (and their alternative instructions) were being protected against a fault in kernel space from linux 3.15.  The problem was introduced in commit f31a9f7 ("x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area") which ends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting instead of the target of the alternative in .text, leaving the instruction un-protected.  You can find a reproducer (thanks to Allan for his help with/comments on it!) triggering the fault in kernel space attached to this e-mail but it should be noted there are a few different places where these instructions are used un-protected and the reproducer only uses one of them present in the kvm code.  You can find a list of all such places in the attached unprotected_xsave_faults attachment which was generated against a v4.0-rc1 defconfig + CONFIG_KVM vmlinux.o (the most concerning one probably being in __switch_to()).  The reproducer is a patch to apply on top of lkvm (<https://github.com/penberg/linux-kvm>) but it should be trivial to write as a standalone C application.  It should be noted that this vulnerability is present even if the hardware does not support xsaveS.  This is fixed by upstream commit 06c8173eb:    <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06> """  Also, more detailed problem description:  """ We have two different mecanisms in the kernel that are involved here:   - the alternative instructions: it allows the Linux kernel to self-modify    its running code to use optimized instructions when they are available    on the host CPU.  The way it works is that the initial instruction in    .text is supported by all CPU variants and we add optimized version of    the instruction in the .altinstr_replacement section.  At boot, or when    loading a kernel module, the kernel will replace the instruction in    .text by its optimized version from .altinstr_replacement if the CPU    supports it, we can see it as something like this:       if (cpu_has_fexture_X())              memcpy(.text, .altinstr_replacement, sizeof(instruction));     The CPU will never have its instruction pointer pointing in    .altinstr_replacement, this is just used as a memory source when    applying the alternative instructions.   - the ex_table entries: it allows the kernel to mark addresses where a    fault might occur but should not cause a panic.  It works by storing in    the __ex_table section a pair of addresses, the first one being the    address of the instruction which could fault, and the second is where    the execution should continue when that fault happens.  On page fault in    kernel space, the page fault handler will check if there is an ex_table    entry corresponding to where the fault happened, and if that's the case,    will restore the CPU context with RIP pointing to that second address.    This is how copy_from_user() does not panic the kernel when the userland    pointer given as argument is borked for example.  Now, the xsave instruction (or its alternatives xsaveopt and xsaves) could fault for different reasons (unaligned memory operands, non-cannonical address memory operand, ...), so we want to have an ex_table entry pointing to the xsave instruction in .text so that if it faults, the kernel does not die but simply continue its normal flaw and return an error to the caller.  > <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324>  The problem with the above commit is that it correctly added an ex_table entry to prevent this, but the pointer to the instruction which might fault was not pointing to .text but to .altinstr_replacement.  The effect is that if userspace manages to trigger the fault on xsave (which is in .text), the page fault handler will never find a corresponding ex_table entry and will consider this as an unhandled fault.  The fix is to make the ex_table entry properly point to .text and not to .altinstr_replacement so the kernel properly handles the fault and does not die. """   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1204729#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-23 12:28:40 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1204724](show_bug.cgi?id=1204724 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-2672 CVE-2015-2666 kernel: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1204729#c2)  Petr Matousek    2015-03-28 21:06:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

  [f31a9f7](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324) ("x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area")

introduced alternative instructions for XSAVES/XRSTORS and commit:

  [adb9d52](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/adb9d526e98268b647a74726346e1c40e6a37d2e) ("x86/xsaves: Add xsaves and xrstors support for booting time")

added support for the XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions at boot time.

Unfortunately both failed to properly protect them against faulting:

The 'xstate_fault' macro will use the closest label named '1'
backward and that ends up in the .altinstr_replacement section
rather than in .text. This means that the kernel will never find
in the __ex_table the .text address where this instruction might
fault, leading to serious problems if userspace manages to
trigger the fault.

x86/fpu/xsaves: Fix improper uses of \_\_ex\_tableCommit:
f31a9f7c7169 ("x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area")
introduced alternative instructions for XSAVES/XRSTORS and commit:
adb9d526e982 ("x86/xsaves: Add xsaves and xrstors support for booting time")
added support for the XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions at boot time.
Unfortunately both failed to properly protect them against faulting:
The 'xstate\_fault' macro will use the closest label named '1'
backward and that ends up in the .altinstr\_replacement section
rather than in .text. This means that the kernel will never find
in the \_\_ex\_table the .text address where this instruction might
fault, leading to serious problems if userspace manages to
trigger the fault.
