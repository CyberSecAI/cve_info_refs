- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists within the `WESPMonitor.WESPMonitorCtrl.1` ActiveX control. The vulnerability occurs when an invalid IP address is provided to the `Connect()` method, and a page reload is forced, causing a pointer to be referenced after it has been freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability in the `Connect()` method of the `WESPMonitor.WESPMonitorCtrl.1` ActiveX control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser on vulnerable installations of WebGate eDVR Manager.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must entice a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file that exploits the ActiveX control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious page or provide a malicious file to the target user.
