Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistent use of `$_REQUEST` and `$_GET` variables in the WPML plugin's AJAX request handling. Specifically, while nonce verification uses `$_GET` parameters, the subsequent action to be performed is determined using `$_REQUEST` parameters, allowing an attacker to bypass nonce check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Nonce Bypass:** The primary weakness is a flawed nonce check. The plugin verifies the nonce using `$_GET` parameters (`icl_ajx_action` and `nonce`), but the actual action to be executed is determined by the `icl_ajx_action` parameter passed via `$_REQUEST`, which includes POST parameters. This allows an attacker to provide a valid nonce in the URL (`$_GET`), pass the nonce check, and then specify a different administrative action via a POST request (`$_REQUEST`), effectively bypassing the intended security mechanism.
*   **Unauthenticated Administrative Function Execution:** Due to the nonce bypass, an unauthenticated attacker can execute any of the approximately 50 WPML AJAX actions intended for administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation/Destruction:** Attackers can manipulate or destroy data within the WordPress site.
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `icl_save_language_negotiation_type` AJAX action, an attacker can define a root HTML file path that gets included and evaluated by PHP using `include $html_file;`. This can lead to:
    *   **Server-Side File Disclosure:** Reading server-side files like `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If allowed by PHP settings, it can evaluate PHP code hosted on a remote site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request with specific parameters.
*   **Nonce Reuse:** The attacker needs a valid nonce from the target site. This nonce can be from any plugin or the core WordPress system, and can be obtained without authentication if other plugins, like bbpress, generate them for unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **Valid Nonce:** The attacker needs a valid nonce generated by the target site (or from another plugin on the same site that generates nonces for unauthenticated users).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present due to mixed usage of `$_GET` and `$_REQUEST` parameters in nonce verification and action handling.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable even without a default WP installation if other plugins, such as bbpress, which generates nonces for unauthenticated users, are present.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to read the `/etc/passwd` file by changing WPML settings.
* The vulnerability was fixed in WPML version 3.1.9
