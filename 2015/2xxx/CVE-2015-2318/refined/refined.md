  "summary": "The provided content describes a TLS impersonation vulnerability (SKIP-TLS) in the Mono TLS implementation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform client impersonation by skipping necessary handshake messages. The root cause is the improper validation of the TLS handshake state. The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, requiring the attacker to intercept and modify network traffic. Multiple sources confirm that this issue affects various versions of Mono and that the fix is included in Mono 3.12.1 and later. Patches for older versions are also available.",
