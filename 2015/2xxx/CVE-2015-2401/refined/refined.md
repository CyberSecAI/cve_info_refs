Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper handling can corrupt memory, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker could convince a user to view this malicious website.
- Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content/ads to host the exploit.
- Users could be tricked into clicking a link leading to the attacker's site or opening a malicious email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website the victim is likely to visit.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by visiting the website).
- No specific user privileges are required for the attacker to be successful; the impact of the vulnerability is based on the level of permissions the user running Internet Explorer has.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Critical" for Windows client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
- This is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the July 2015 security update for Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11.
- The fix involves modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
