Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2308:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `HttpCache` class in Symfony uses `eval()` to execute cached files when they contain ESI tags. The vulnerability exists because PHP allows execution of code within `<script language="php">` tags without proper escaping before evaluation, which enables injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  PHP code injection vulnerability due to improper handling of  `<script language="php">` tags within ESI content.
-  Lack of sufficient escaping of user-submitted values, which makes the system vulnerable to code injection via XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user injects PHP code through a user-submitted variable, specifically within a `<script language="php">` tag, which is then evaluated by the `HttpCache` class.
- This can be achieved via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in websites using Symfony, where user input is not properly escaped.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to submit data that includes  `<script language="php">` tags.
- The targeted application must have ESI support enabled.
- The application must be using the `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpCache` class.
- Ideally, the attacker can leverage an existing XSS vulnerability to inject the payload into user-submitted variables.
