The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-2481.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from improper optimization of certain parameters by the RyuJIT compiler in Microsoft .NET Framework, leading to code generation errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is a flaw in the RyuJIT compiler's optimization process that results in incorrect code generation. This vulnerability is classified as an elevation of privilege.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This enables the attacker to perform various actions such as installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to host a specially crafted .NET application and convince a user to run it. There is no way to force a user to run this application, therefore the attacker relies on social engineering techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .NET application and successfully convince a user to execute the application.
