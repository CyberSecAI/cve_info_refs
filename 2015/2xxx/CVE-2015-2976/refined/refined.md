Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Research Artisan Lite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a classic XSS (CWE-79) issue. This means the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
There are two main attack scenarios:
1.  **User-Side XSS:** If a user visits a webpage containing malicious code, that code can be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
2.  **Stored XSS via Access Logs:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through a crafted URL. This code gets stored in the access logs. When an administrator views these logs, the malicious code is executed in the administrator's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a webpage that contains malicious JavaScript which, when visited by a user with the vulnerable software, will cause the user's browser to execute the script.
2.  **Specially Crafted URLs:** An attacker can craft a URL containing JavaScript code, and induce users or administrators to visit the crafted URL. The server then logs this input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For the user-side XSS, the attacker needs to be able to lure the user to a malicious web page, or inject a malicious script into a web page visited by the user.
*   For stored XSS through log injection, the attacker can be remote and only needs to send the crafted URL to the target server which has Research Artisan Lite installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Research Artisan Lite prior to 1.18.
- The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS base score of 4.3.
- The access vector is network based, which means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, even if the attacker is not on the same network.
- The access complexity is medium meaning the attack conditions are somewhat specialized.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The integrity impact is partial which implies that an attacker has some limited control over what can be modified.
