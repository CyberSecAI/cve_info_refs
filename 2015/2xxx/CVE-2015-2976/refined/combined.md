# JVN#58020495 Research Artisan Lite vulnerable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

Research Artisan Lite provided by Research Artisan Project contains multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

## Products Affected

* Research Artisan Lite prior to ver.1.18

## Description

Research Artisan Lite provided by Research Artisan Project is an access analysis tool. Research Artisan Lite contains multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities ([CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)).

## Impact

There are two attack scenarios.

1. If a user views a malicious web page, an arbitrary script may be executed on the user's web browser.
2. An attacker accesses a specially crafted URL which may include javascript code. The server then stores the access logs for analysis. When an administrator views the analysis results, a script is executed on the administrator's web browser.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

## Vendor Status

| Vendor | Status | Last Update | Vendor Notes |

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |

Base Score:4.3
