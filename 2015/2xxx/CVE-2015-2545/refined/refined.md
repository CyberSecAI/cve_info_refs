Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Microsoft Office handles malformed Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files. Specifically, the EPS file processing logic within Office fails to properly handle certain image data, which allows for memory corruption and ultimately remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of malformed EPS files.
- Lack of proper sanitization and validation of EPS image data within the processing logic.
- Exploitable through both email and web-based attack vectors, leveraging a user to open a malicious EPS file or an Office file containing such a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the vulnerable application.
- Complete system compromise: If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker can take full control of the system, installing programs, accessing, modifying or deleting data, and creating new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted malicious file containing a malformed EPS image via email. The vulnerability can be triggered when a user previews or opens the email with an affected application. In some cases, minimal user interaction, such as previewing the email in Outlook, is enough to exploit the vulnerability
- **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website with a specially crafted Office file containing a malicious EPS image. The vulnerability is triggered when a user is convinced to visit the site and open the malicious file using a vulnerable Office application. Compromised websites can also be leveraged in this attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver a malformed EPS file, either as a direct file attachment or embedded inside another file format, such as a Microsoft Office document.
- The attacker needs to lure a victim into opening or previewing the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software, either through email or by visiting a malicious or compromised website.
- No special access rights are needed to perform the attack on the affected system.

**Additional Technical Details (From Morphisec Blog Post):**

- The exploit attempts to differentiate between 32-bit and 64-bit processes to tailor its ROP chain.
- The exploit uses the vulnerability multiple times, to first identify the process architecture, then corrupt a new vector, and then to leak data from the EPSIMP32 module.
- The exploit leverages heap spraying techniques by allocating several large chunks of memory and populating those chunks with carefully crafted data.
- The exploit includes functionality to locate the base address of modules in memory by parsing the PE headers and import tables to locate required function addresses.
- The exploit searches for system call numbers, including handling hooked system calls by security solutions.
- A ROP chain is constructed within the PostScript itself to implement the VirtualProtect system call and load a payload (plugin.dll).
- The payload DLL escalates privileges, which is loaded after the successful ROP execution.
- The described exploit bypasses the latest version of EMET 5.5, highlighting the need for application-agnostic security solutions.

**Workaround (From Microsoft Security Bulletin):**
- Modifying the Access Control List (ACL) to deny access to `EPSIMP32.FLT` for all users. This effectively prevents EPS files from loading, and consequently blocks the exploit. This workaround can be implemented through registry edits, scripts, or the use of automated Microsoft "Fix It" tools, however it will impact functionality by not loading EPS images and should be reversed before applying patches.
