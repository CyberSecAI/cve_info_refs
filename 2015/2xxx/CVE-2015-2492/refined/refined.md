**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer due to improper access of objects in memory. This can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE).
- An attacker can gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data

    - Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content that are injected with malicious code.
    - Malicious attachments sent via email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a website or inject malicious code into existing websites.
- Ability to trick a user into visiting a malicious link or opening a malicious file using social engineering or other techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for client systems (workstations) and **Moderate** for server systems.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds are identified.
