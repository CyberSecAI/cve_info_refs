Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Securifi Almond and Almond 2015 routers suffer from a global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (CWE-352):** The web interface does not properly protect against CSRF attacks. This means that a malicious attacker can craft a request that will be treated as a legitimate request by an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform actions on the router's web interface with the same permissions as a logged-in user. This could lead to configuration changes, denial of service, or other unauthorized actions.
- If default credentials are in use, the attacker does not even need a user to be logged in, as they could login as part of the attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must induce a victim with an active session on the web interface to trigger a malicious request, typically by visiting a specially crafted web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to convince a user to load a malicious page or resource while the user has an active session with the router's web management interface.
- If default credentials are in use, the attacker needs to be able to make requests to the web interface to create a valid session before sending the CSRF requests.
