Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect data-type size being used when splitting a message within the Quassel IRC client. Specifically, when handling CTCP queries containing multibyte characters, the code was using a byte index as a character index, leading to incorrect message splitting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect data-type usage:** The code was using a byte index to access a string, which is indexed by characters. This is particularly problematic when dealing with multibyte characters where a single character might be represented by multiple bytes.
- **Improper message splitting:** Due to the incorrect indexing, the message splitting algorithm was not able to correctly handle multibyte characters, which can lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a crash in the Quassel core by sending an overlength CTCP query containing only multibyte characters, effectively causing a denial of service for all connected clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, specifically via the IRC protocol.
- **CTCP Query:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted CTCP query, which has an overlength containing only multibyte characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user connected to the Quassel core to send the malicious CTCP query.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The fix involves using `QTextBoundaryFinder` to split messages at word or grapheme boundaries, ensuring correct handling of multibyte characters.
- The old code used a recursive splitting algorithm that could lead to stack overflows, which is also addressed in this commit by using a non-recursive method.
- The vulnerability is related to how the `lastParamOverrun()` function was used, which returned byte indices instead of character indices.
- The vulnerability is present in Quassel versions before 0.12-rc1.

**Summary:**
The core of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect usage of byte indices to access character strings when splitting messages, especially CTCP queries with multibyte characters. This leads to a crash of the Quassel core, causing a denial of service for all connected clients. The exploit requires an attacker to be an authenticated user connected to the Quassel core.
