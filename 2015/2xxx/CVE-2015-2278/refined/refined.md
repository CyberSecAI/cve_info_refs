Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-2278:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the LZH decompression routine due to improper indexing of arrays 'e' and 'd'.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The vulnerability stems from reading memory outside the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code indexes the 'e' and 'd' arrays using a value that can be controlled by the attacker, potentially reading memory beyond the bounds of the allocated array. This can lead to a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, likely due to a crash when an invalid memory location is accessed.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, reading out-of-bounds may lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted compressed data:** The attacker crafts malicious data that, when decompressed by a vulnerable application, causes an out-of-bounds read.
- **Server-side attacks:** An attacker can send specially crafted packets to vulnerable SAP Netweaver services like the Dispatcher or Gateway.
- **Client-side attacks:**  An attacker can send a malicious .CAR or .SAR archive file designed to trigger the vulnerability when decompressed by the SAPCAR tool. Another client-side attack vector involves enticing users to connect to a malicious SAP server using SAP GUI.
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:**  Due to the lack of default encryption on many affected services, an attacker could inject malicious packets to trigger the vulnerability during communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send or provide malicious compressed data to a vulnerable SAP application or service.
- For man-in-the-middle attacks, the attacker needs to be positioned within the network path of communications between SAP clients and servers.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `CsObjectInt::BuildHufTree` function, specifically in the part of the code that handles non-simple codes.
- The vulnerable code is found in `vpa108csulzh.cpp` within the MaxDB source code.
- The "e" and "d" arrays are indexed with the value of "*p - s", both values being under the control of an attacker.
- The vulnerability affects a large number of SAP products that utilize the LZH compression algorithm.

**Affected Software:**
- The content specifies that the following SAP products are affected:
    - SAP Netweaver Application Server ABAP
    - SAP Netweaver Application Server Java
    - SAP Netweaver RFC SDK
    - SAP RFC SDK
    - SAP GUI
    - SAP MaxDB database
    - SAPCAR archive tool
