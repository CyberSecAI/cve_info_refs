- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Securifi Almond router uses a default password of "admin" for the admin account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Use of default credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local area network attacker can gain privileged access to the web management interface or leverage default credentials in remote attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Local area network access to the web management interface.
  - Remote attacks that can exploit default credentials, including CSRF attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Local network access to the router.
  - Ability to perform network-based attacks (for CSRF).
