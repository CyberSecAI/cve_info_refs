Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Easy Social Icons" version 1.2.2 has insufficient validation on the `image_file` parameter. This lack of validation allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
*   The plugin also lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, as it does not use random tokens to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:**  The `image_file` parameter is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of input validation. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352:** The plugin does not implement CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can combine the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities to trick an administrator into setting a persistent XSS payload. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser whenever they access the affected WordPress page.
*   The injected JavaScript could perform various malicious actions, such as redirecting users, stealing session cookies, or modifying content on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, will modify the social icon settings with the attacker's XSS payload. This can be done through a malicious link or a website controlled by the attacker.
*   **XSS:** The `image_file` parameter, lacking proper sanitization, accepts arbitrary JavaScript, which is stored in the database and executed on the victim's browser when the page with the social icons is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to interact with the crafted CSRF attack. This could be achieved by using social engineering tactics.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the CSRF attack.
*   The attacker has to inject the JavaScript code into `image_file` parameter

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Flokstra of ITsec Security Services.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.3 of the plugin.
* A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, demonstrating how a crafted HTML form can inject malicious JavaScript using CSRF.

This information provides more details than the typical CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameter (`image_file`), the lack of CSRF protection, and the combined exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
