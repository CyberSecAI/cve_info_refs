{
  "CVE-2015-2296": {
    "description": "The issue occurs when Requests is handling a HTTP response that is a redirection and that also sets cookies without an explicit domain parameter. Instead of the cookies only being set for the domain which sent the HTTP response, they are also sent to the redirection target, regardless of its domain.",
    "vulnerability": "Session fixation and cookie stealing vulnerability due to improper handling of cookies during redirects.",
     "impact": "A remote attacker could use this issue to perform session fixation or cookie stealing attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "By controlling the redirection source, an attacker can make requests perform a request to any third-party domain with cookies of their choosing. Also, if the attacker controls the redirection target, they are able to steal any cookies set by the third-party redirection.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control either the redirection source or the redirection target. This involves making Requests hit a URL controlled by the attacker or making a third-party site redirect to a URL controlled by the attacker.",
	  "root_cause": "The requests library incorrectly ascribes cookies without an explicit domain parameter to the target domain of a redirect, rather than the originating domain."
