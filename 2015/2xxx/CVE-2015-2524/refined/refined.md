Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2524:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.

*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation and enforcement of impersonation levels in Microsoft Windows.

*   **Weakness:** Windows Task Management Elevation of Privilege

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker must first log on to the system, then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass impersonation-level security checks and gain elevated privileges on the targeted system.

*   **Affected Software:** Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8/8.1, Windows Server 2012/2012 R2, Windows RT/RT 8.1, and Windows 10.

*   **Mitigation:** Apply the security update that corrects how Windows validates impersonation events.

The Exploit-DB entry provides additional details on a specific exploitation method related to this CVE using the `CreateObjectTask` scheduled task and the `SettingsSyncDiagnostics` COM object.

*   **Specific Exploit Technique:** The `CreateObjectTask` scheduled task initializes a user accessible system COM service which allows instantiation of the `SettingsSyncDiagnostics` COM object. This object, when copying log files with the `StopLogging` method, doesn't properly impersonate the caller, leading to code execution as local system. This allows an attacker to copy the log files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting system files and gaining elevated privileges.

*   **Exploit Details:** The `StopLogging` method doesn’t impersonate the caller when moving the logs to the user defined location which means it runs as local system. It’s possible to use this to copy the log files to arbitrary locations using appropriate symbolic link attacks.

*   **Impact (Specific Exploit):** Overwrite system files with attacker-controlled content, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
