## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Task Management Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2524

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass impersonation-level security checks and gain elevated privileges on a targeted system.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates impersonation events.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Windows Task File Deletion Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2525

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows Task Scheduler when it improperly verifies certain file system interactions. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Task Scheduler verifies file system interactions.

The CreateObjectTask scheduled task initializes a user accessible system COM service which allows you to instantiate the SettingsSyncDiagnostics COM object. This object doesn’t take into account the caller when copying logs files leading to EoP.

Description:

The Microsoft\Windows\Shell\CreateObjectTask initializes a shell32 based ICreateObject COM server as local system. This is marked as being accessible from a normal user account so once created we can attach to it. The server only has one method, CreateObject which checks the CLSID against a list of known safe classes before allowing it to be instantiated. One of these classes is a diagnostic class for setting synchronization implemented in SettingSync.dll.

This class allows an event log to be initialized with the StartLogging method and then the logs copied to an arbitary location with the StopLogging method. The StopLogging method doesn’t impersonate the caller when moving the logs to the user defined location which means it runs as local system. It’s possible to use this to copy the log files to arbitrary locations using appropriate symbolic link attacks. We can get data into the log file by sending trace events to the appropriate provider, this could allow string data to be added to the file. The name of the file is under attacker control so it can be renamed to .hta or .ps1 which would allow the limited control over the contents to be abused in error tolerant script engines.

Another way of exploiting this takes into account that the SHFileOperations call which moves the file resets the ACLs (where applicable) on the file to match the expected inherited permissions. So for example you could drop the file as c:\program.exe and it would pick up the default DACL for C:\ (which allows Authenticated Users modify permissions) but the call doesn’t reapply the High IL label. This could be used indirectly in bad system services with unquoted file paths as the normal user could re-write the files contents to an malicious executable. A second trick with this is there’s a race between the move and the resetting of the ACLs. As the shell uses TreeSetNamedSecurityInfo it will also walk directory hierarchies, therefore by switching the symlink from the original target to a directory (say c:\users) you can force parts of the system drive to reset their ACLs, leading to the user being able to modify new parts of the file system which again could be exploited..

Exploitation is complicated somewhat by a bug in the proxy in actxprxy.dll. Presumably in the original MIDL file for the COM object the StopLogging method is incorrectly marked, the single WCHAR* parameter is missing the [string] attribute. This results in the built-in proxy only marshalling a single WCHAR to the server, this tends to cause things to not work so well and leads to a limited information disclosure as whatever’s after the single character in memory up to the next NUL is assumed to be part of the path. Fortunately the stub is sufficiently simple that by sending a plain array buffer to the server it’ll pick up the correct data. I’ve done this in the PoC by implementing my own custom COM proxy object.

Proof of Concept:

The PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by copying the log file to the system drive. The password for the 7z file is ‘password’.

1) Extract the PoC to a location on a local hard disk
2) As a normal user execute the PoC.
3) The PoC should complete execution.

Expected Result:
The log file should fail to be moved to the specified target.

Observed Result:
The log file ends up copied to c:\program.exe and can be modified by the current user.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
