Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2789:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-2789 and describes a specific vulnerability related to Foxit Reader's "FoxitCloudUpdateService." This vulnerability aligns with the common definition of unquoted service path privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an *unquoted service path* issue in the "FoxitCloudUpdateService" Windows service. This means that the service's executable path, which is stored in the registry, is not enclosed in quotation marks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is an unquoted service path. Windows searches for executables in paths listed in the `PATH` environment variable. When a service path is not quoted, Windows might interpret spaces within the service path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Foxit Software\...`) as delimiters, potentially leading to the execution of an arbitrary file located at a path fragment (e.g., `C:\Program.exe`).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The malicious code will run with the elevated privileges associated with the service.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local. A non-privileged local user must place a malicious executable in a location that would be parsed by the OS as part of the service path before the legitimate service executable. For example if the service path is `C:\Program Files\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\Foxit Cloud\FCUpdateService.exe` without quotes an attacker could place a malicious executable as `C:\Program.exe`

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be a local user on the system.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to write files to the system's root directory or any other directories that would be parsed as part of the unquoted service path.
    *   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable service name and its binary path to craft the exploit.

**3. Additional Details**
*  The exploit-db.com entry explicitly mentions that the vulnerability impacts versions 7.0.6.1126 and 6.1 of Foxit Reader.
* The advisory from zeroscience.mk confirms that Foxit addressed the issue in version 7.1 of Foxit Reader.
* The provided output of `sc qc FoxitCloudUpdateService` shows the service's binary path, startup type, and account, which are necessary to understand and exploit the vulnerability.
