Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in the MediaWiki CheckUser extension. The CheckUser extension allows users with specific permissions to look up sensitive information about other users (e.g., IP addresses associated with usernames). The vulnerability stems from the fact that the form used to perform these lookups did not include any CSRF protection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection on the CheckUser lookup form. This means that an attacker could craft a malicious request that, when unknowingly submitted by an authenticated CheckUser, would perform unwanted actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Log Flooding:** An attacker could trick a user with CheckUser rights into submitting multiple, unnecessary lookup requests. This would flood the CheckUser logs with untrustworthy or irrelevant data, making legitimate investigations more difficult.
*   **Defamation:** By repeatedly submitting lookups for certain users, an attacker could defame a trusted user or cause confusion and mistrust.
*   **No Data Exfiltration:** The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to see the responses to the crafted requests, meaning that they cannot directly obtain sensitive information about other users. However, it can cause issues with the integrity and usability of logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker would need to host a malicious website that contains a form or script designed to send a CSRF request to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a user with CheckUser permissions into visiting their malicious website while they are logged into the vulnerable MediaWiki instance. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Account:** The attacker needs only a basic user account on the MediaWiki instance.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious Site:** The attacker needs a platform to host a webpage containing the malicious CSRF request.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to trick CheckUser users into visiting the malicious page.
