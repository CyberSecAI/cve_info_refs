{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "MediaWiki's SVG filtering could be bypassed with entity encoding under the Zend interpreter. This is due to a change in libxml's behavior of not expanding XML entities by default.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a bypass of the SVG filter allowing for the injection of JavaScript due to unexpanded XML entities.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker may be able to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.",
  "Attack vectors": "By uploading a crafted SVG file with entity encoded JavaScript that is not caught by the filter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload an SVG file to the MediaWiki instance.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerability was discovered internally and by Mario Gomes/Beyond Security. The fix involves using XMLReader instead of xml_parse to ensure full expansion of XML entities during filtering. This addresses the fact that secure operation of MediaWiki was relying on a libxml behavior that was removed for security reasons in the library itself."
