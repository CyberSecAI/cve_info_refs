Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Hyper-V initializes system data structures within guest virtual machines. This improper initialization leads to a state where a specially crafted application can exploit the flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper system data structure initialization in Hyper-V. This is a memory corruption vulnerability, specifically relating to the way Hyper-V manages memory allocation for guest VMs
- Remote Code Execution vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution in the host context. This means the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the physical machine hosting the Hyper-V virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application within a guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials for the guest VM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid logon credentials for a guest virtual machine hosted by a vulnerable Hyper-V instance.
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the guest VM. This typically requires the ability to run applications on the VM.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions a related vulnerability, CVE-2015-2361, which is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Hyper-V that can also lead to remote code execution in the host context.
- Both vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-2361 and CVE-2015-2362) require an attacker to be able to execute code within a guest virtual machine to exploit the hypervisor on the host.
- The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Hyper-V initializes system data structures, in the case of CVE-2015-2362, and how it handles packet size memory initialization for CVE-2015-2361.
