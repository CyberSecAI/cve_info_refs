Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2703:

**Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting in Websense Content Gateway error messages**

*   **Root Cause:** The Websense Content Gateway error messages process user-controllable data insecurely. Specifically, user input within the `admin_msg` parameter is not properly encoded when displayed, leading to XSS vulnerability. The `admin_msg` parameter is a Base64 encoded error message that can contain HTML and scripting code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side scripting code into the error page. This can allow them to:
    *   Steal the victim's session tokens or login credentials.
    *   Perform arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf.
    *   Log the victim's keystrokes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a Base64 encoded payload with malicious javascript and trick a victim into opening the crafted link via email or instant message.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft a malicious URL.
    *   Ability to get a victim to click on the malicious link.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting in Websense Data Security block page**

*   **Root Cause:** The Websense Data Security block page processes user-controllable data insecurely. When a website is blocked, a message is sent back to the server using Base64 encoding, which includes user related information like the client's IP address. This message is not properly encoded before being used in the block page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side scripting code into the block page. This can allow them to:
    *   Steal the victim's session tokens or login credentials.
    *   Perform arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf.
    *   Log the victim's keystrokes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs a valid `ws-session` and can inject a Base64 encoded payload via the `ws-encdata` URL parameter in the block page URL. The attacker must trick the victim into opening this specially crafted link.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   A valid `ws-session` is required.
    *   Ability to craft a malicious URL with a Base64 encoded payload.
    *   Ability to get a victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Websense Triton v7.8.3 and Websense appliance modules V-Series v7.7. Other versions may be affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerabilities are resolved in TRITON APX Version 8.0.
