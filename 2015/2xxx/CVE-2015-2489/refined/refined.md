**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This could allow a script to run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper permission validation by Internet Explorer.
- Potential for elevation of privilege.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.
- This vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code to be run by itself, but it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability, like a remote code execution, to take advantage of the elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attack scenario: An attacker could host a website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites and websites that accept user-provided content could also contain specially crafted content to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website. This could be achieved by tricking the user into clicking a link.
- The attacker would need to chain this vulnerability with another one to achieve code execution with elevated privileges.

The document states the update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
