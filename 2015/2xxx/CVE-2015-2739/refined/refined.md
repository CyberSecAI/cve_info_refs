Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-2739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in `ArrayBufferBuilder::append` within the `dom/base/nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp` file of Mozilla Firefox.
*   The code calculates the new capacity required for the buffer, but it does not properly handle cases where adding the current buffer length and the new data length would result in an integer overflow, leading to a buffer that is smaller than the needed size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Integer Overflow: The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the calculation of the new buffer capacity.
*   Memory Corruption: When an integer overflow occurs, the subsequent `memcpy` writes data outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
*   Uninitialized memory: Uninitialized memory may also be used in some cases, though this is not the focus of this specific CVE

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Memory Corruption: A successful exploit can corrupt memory, potentially leading to a crash.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: In some scenarios, it could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
*   Denial of service (application crash)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious XMLHttpRequest Response: A server could send a malicious XMLHttpRequest containing a very large `aDataLen` value, designed to trigger the overflow.
*   Crafted Web Content: A specially crafted website could exploit this vulnerability. The code related to XMLHttpRequest and ArrayBufferBuilder is exposed via web content and could be abused by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote: The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability by delivering malicious content through a web server.
*   Limited Knowledge Required: Although some exploitation scenarios might be complex, a basic knowledge of HTTP requests and responses is sufficient.
*   No special authentication or privileges is required for the exploitation.

**Technical details from Mozilla Bugzilla:**

* The vulnerability lies in the `ArrayBufferBuilder::append` function within the file `dom\base\nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp`.
* A large value of `aDataLen`, when added to `mLength`, can cause an overflow.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by bug 866431.
*   The fix involves using `CheckedUint32` for arithmetic operations.
*   The bug affects multiple versions of Firefox, including Firefox 38 and later, as well as the ESR releases starting from 31 and later.
* The vulnerability is exploitable through XMLHttpRequests
*   The bug has been rated as `sec-high` and as `csectype-intoverflow`.
