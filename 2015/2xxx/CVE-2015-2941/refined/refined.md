Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki's API handles errors when using the deprecated `wddx` output format, specifically when running under HHVM versions prior to 3.6.1.  If an API request with `format=wddx` includes an invalid parameter, the error message generated by MediaWiki reflects the user-supplied parameter without proper output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of output encoding of user-supplied parameters within the `wddx` formatted error response. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary XML, which can be interpreted by the browser as XHTML, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript.
*   **Use of Deprecated Feature:** Although the `wddx` format was deprecated, the system continued to process requests using it. This created an attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  A successful attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a user's browser session on the affected MediaWiki domain.
*   **Potential for various attacks:** The executed Javascript code can be used to perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, such as session hijacking, defacement, information theft, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted URL that includes the `format=wddx` parameter and an invalid parameter containing malicious XML/JavaScript code. The victim needs to click on the crafted URL.
*   **User interaction required:** The user has to click on the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and trick users into clicking them.
*   The attacker does not require any specific user level permissions.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects MediaWiki when running on HHVM before version 3.6.1.
*   The fix involves using a safer method of serializing the output within the  `ApiFormatWddx` class, mitigating the lack of proper encoding in error messages.
*   The vulnerability bypassed some browser anti-XSS filters, including Chrome's, making it more effective.
*   The provided information is more descriptive than the official CVE description, including technical details and an example payload.
