Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the generation and use of session hashes within Oracle Endeca Information Discovery's Integrator ETL server. Specifically, the issue lies in the usage of fixed data during authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication checks.
- Insecure Session Hash Generation: The use of fixed data when generating session hashes leads to a predictable and exploitable authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the clover service, which can lead to full system compromise.
- Data Manipulation/Disclosure: Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to and modify sensitive information.
- Complete System Compromise: The ability to execute code can lead to complete takeover of vulnerable systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- Unauthenticated Access: Exploitation does not require any authentication or user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Oracle Endeca Information Discovery server.
- No Authentication Required: The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Integrator component of Oracle Endeca Information Discovery Studio.
- Oracle released a patch to address this vulnerability as part of their July 2015 Critical Patch Update.
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle by Steven Seeley of Source Incite through the Zero Day Initiative.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P), which is considered high risk.
