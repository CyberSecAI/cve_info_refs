Package        : shibboleth-sp2
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2684

A denial of service vulnerability was found in the Shibboleth (an
federated identity framework) Service Provider. When processing certain
malformed SAML message generated by an authenticated attacker, the
daemon could crash.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.3+dfsg-5+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.5.3+dfsg-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3+dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your shibboleth-sp2 packages.

Shibboleth Service Provider Security Advisory [19 March 2015]
An updated version of the Shibboleth Service Provider software
is now available which addresses a denial of service vulnerability.
A denial of service vulnerability also exists in the Xerces-C XML
parser used by the software.
OpenSSL has also announced several similar vulnerabilities.
Platforms on which Xerces-C V3.1.1 is an OS-supplied component,
such as Red Hat 7, OpenSUSE 13, and others, will need to ensure
their vendor has supplied an updated package to correct the issue.
On all but Windows, deployers also need to ensure that a suitably
patched version of OpenSSL is used.
Shibboleth SP software crashes on malformed input messages
===============================================================
The SP software contains an authenticated denial of service
vulnerability that results in a crash on certain kinds of malformed
SAML messages. The vulnerability is only triggered when special
conditions are met and after a message or assertion signature
has been verified, so exploitation requires a message produced
under a trusted key, limiting the impact.
This vulnerability has been published as CVE-2015-2684.
More seriously, versions of the Apache Xerces-C XML parser
prior to the just-released V3.1.2 also contain a vulnerability
that causes a crash on malformed input documents. This crash
occurs early in the parsing process and can be exploited by
an unauthenticated attacker. The SP software is vulnerable
to this issue when used with an affected Xerces-C library.
The Xerces-C vulnerability has been published as CVE-2015-0252.
OpenSSL also announced a large set of issues, mostly of a similar
variety, some of which would potentially impact the SP software.
A number of separate issues and CVEs are involved and a link to
the advisories can be found below.
Recommendations
===============
Update to V2.5.4 or later of the Shibboleth SP software, and
ensure that V3.1.2 or later of the Xerces-C library is used,
and that an appropriately patched version of OpenSSL is used,
generally either 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r, or 0.9.8zf or later.
For Windows installations, V2.5.4 of the Shibboleth SP is now
available and contains updates to several libraries, including these
updates to both Xerces-C 3.1.2 and OpenSSL 1.0.2a.
Linux installations relying on official RPM packages can upgrade to
the latest package versions to obtain the fixes.
Sites that rely on an OS-supplied version of Xerces-C V3.1.1 will
need to contact their OS vendor for a fixed version, or manually
build a new or patched version. All RPM platforms on which the OS-
supplied version of Xerces-C is older than V3.1.0 are now built
with Xerces-C V3.1.2 and this is included as a dependent package.
Any use of Xerces-C V2.x is now unsupported, both by the Xerces
Project itself and by the Shibboleth Project.
Sites building from source will need to ensure that the Xerces-C,
OpenSSL, and SP libraries and software are updated to remedy these
issues.
