## Vulnerabilities in Windows Journal Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3089669)

Published: September 8, 2015 | Updated: September 23, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Journal file. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Windows excluding Itanium editions, which are not affected. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Windows Journal parses Journal files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3089669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3089669).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Journal Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Windows when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

For an attack to be successful, the vulnerabilities require that a user open a specially crafted Journal file with an affected version of Windows Journal. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Journal file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Windows Journal parses Journal files.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Journal RCE Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2513](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2513) | No | No |
| Windows Journal Integer Overflow RCE Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2519](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2519) | No | No |
| Windows Journal RCE Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2530](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2530) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Do not open Windows Journal (.jnt) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**

  Do not open Windows Journal (.jnt) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* **Remove the .jnt file type association**

  **Interactive Method:**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To remove the .jnt file type association using the interactive method, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click **jntfile**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  3. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **jntfile HKCR file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.
  5. Expand **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER**, then **Software**, then **Microsoft**, then **Windows**, then **CurrentVersion**, then **Explorer**, and then **FileExts**.
  6. Click **.jnt** and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  7. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **.jntHKCU file association registry backup.reg** and then click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  8. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.

  **Using a Managed Script:**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  To remove the .jnt file type association using an interactive, managed script, follow these steps:

  1. First make a backup copy of the registry keys using a managed deployment script with the following commands:
  ```
  Regedit.exe /e jntfile_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jntfile
  Regedit.exe /e jnt_HKCU_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jnt

  ```
  2. Next save the following to a file with a .reg extension (e.g., Delete\_jnt\_file\_association.reg):
  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jntfile]
  [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jnt]

  ```
  3. Run the above registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:

  `Regedit.exe /s Delete_jnt_file_association.reg`

**Impact of workaround.** Double-clicking a .jnt file will no longer launch journal.exe.

**How to undo the workaround:**

Restore the registry key by using Registry Editor to restore the settings saved in the .REG files.

* **Remove Windows Journal by disabling the Windows feature that installs it**

  On Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Programs**.
  2. Click **Turn Windows Features on or off** and then clear the check box for either **Tablet PC Optional Components** (Windows Vista systems) or **Tablet PC Components** (Windows 7 systems).
  3. Click **OK**.

  **Impact of workaround.** Windows Journal is removed from the system.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  To reinstall Windows Journal on Windows Vista or Windows 7 systems, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Programs**.
  2. Click **Turn Windows Features on or off** and then select the check box for either **Tablet PC Optional Components** (Windows Vista systems) or **Tablet PC Components** (Windows 7 systems).
  3. Click **OK**.
  + **Deny access to Journal.exe**

    To deny access to Journal.exe, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    > takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe"
    > icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe" /deny everyone:(F)

    ```

    **Impact of workaround.** Windows Journal becomes inaccessible.

    **How to undo the workaround:**

    To reinstate access to Journal.exe, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    > icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Journal\Journal.exe" /remove:d everyone

    ```
    ## Multiple Windows Journal Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

    Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in Windows Journal. The vulnerabilities are caused when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could cause data loss on the target system. Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights.

    For an attack to be successful, a user must open a specially crafted Journal file with an affected version of Windows Journal. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Journal file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Journal manages objects in memory.

2. Next save the following to a file with a .reg extension (e.g., Delete\_jnt\_file\_association.reg):

   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jntfile]
   [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jnt]
   ```

3.  Run the above registry script created in step 2 on the target machine with the following command:

   ```
   Regedit.exe /s Delete_jnt_file_association.reg
   ```

```
