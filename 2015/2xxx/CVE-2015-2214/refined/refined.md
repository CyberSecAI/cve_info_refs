Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in NetCat CMS, specifically in the `netshop/post.php` page when handling the `redirect_url` parameter. This allows for Full Path Disclosure (FPD).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The application leaks the full server path when a crafted request is made. This is a type of Information Disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can learn the server's full file system path, which can be used in further attacks. This leaked information may be used to craft specific exploits targeting other vulnerabilities or weaknesses on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `redirect_url` parameter in a request to `netshop/post.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NetCat CMS instance.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how web applications handle parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** NetCat CMS versions 5.01, 3.12, 3.0, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.1 are affected.

*   **Vulnerable File:** The specific file affected is `netshop/post.php`.

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `redirect_url` parameter is the source of the vulnerability.

* The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue due to improper input validation and error handling.
