```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A crafted file processed by the upx decoder in ClamAV leads to a crash due to an unspecified issue within the decoding logic.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is present in the upx decoder which is not handling crafted files correctly
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing ClamAV.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker can provide a crafted file for ClamAV to scan.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file to be scanned by ClamAV, which is usually a network position or through delivery of a malicious file
