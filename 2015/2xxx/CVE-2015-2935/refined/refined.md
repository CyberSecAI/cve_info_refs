Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2014-7199), specifically in how MediaWiki handles SVG file uploads. The fix failed to account for case-insensitive variations of the `@import` keyword within SVG style declarations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability exists because MediaWiki's SVG style filtering could be bypassed. The filter was case-sensitive, allowing attackers to use variations like `@imporT` (with a capital T) to evade the check. The incomplete fix allowed an attacker to embed a reference to an external CSS file in an uploaded SVG file using the `@import` directive within a `<style>` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By loading an external stylesheet, the attacker gains the ability to:
*   **Information Leak:** Track users visiting a page displaying the malicious SVG by observing requests to the attacker-controlled server. This can expose the user's IP address, the referring page, and other information contained within the HTTP request.
*   **Anonymity Violation:** The ability to identify users viewing a MediaWiki page violates their anonymity, which could have serious implications if the user were a whistle-blower or a government critic.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing a style tag with a case-insensitive `@import` rule pointing to an attacker-controlled server.
*   When a user views a page that renders this SVG file, their browser fetches the stylesheet from the attackerâ€™s server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload SVG files to the MediaWiki instance.
*   The attacker needs to control a web server to host the malicious stylesheet that will be fetched when the vulnerable SVG is rendered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not directly an XSS vulnerability, as it doesn't directly inject JavaScript. Instead, it's an information leak through external resource loading.
*   The fix involves modifying the regular expressions used to validate SVG file uploads to block the `@import` keyword in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that all case variations of import (e.g., @import, @ImPort, @IMPORT) are blocked.

The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.24.2, 1.23.9, and 1.19.24.
