```
1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CVE-2015-2843):** Lack of input sanitization in the `go_login.php` file, specifically on the `user_name` and `user_pass` parameters before they are handled by the database. Additionally, lack of input sanitization in `go_site.php` when retrieving user info.
  
2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization on user-supplied parameters in multiple files.
   
3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass authentication using SQL injection in the login form.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The SQL injection vulnerability in the 'go_get_user_info' function allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive user information, including usernames and passwords.
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Through the command injection vulnerability in the `cpanel` function, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the server. This is done using the php exec function.
    
4.  **Attack vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  By manipulating the `user_pass` parameter in a POST request to `go_login/validate_credentials` or the `go_get_user_info` function with crafted SQLi strings.
    *   **Command Injection:** By crafting malicious input to the `cpanel` function via GET request parameters.

5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GoAutoDial instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
