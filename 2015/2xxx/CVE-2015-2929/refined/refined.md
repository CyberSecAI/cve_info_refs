Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security issues in Tor:

**CVE ID:** This content relates to multiple potential CVEs, specifically for the issues fixed in Tor versions 0.2.6.7, 0.2.5.12 and 0.2.4.27. The provided text is a request for CVE assignment. Based on the text, it is likely that CVE-2015-2929 is for one of these issues, specifically the first one listed below.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   *   **Issue 1:** A malicious client can trigger an assertion failure in a hidden service. This is caused by a vulnerability in how the hidden service handles requests from clients.
    * **Issue 2:** A client can crash due to an assertion failure when parsing a malformed hidden service descriptor. This is caused by a vulnerability in how the client parses descriptors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   *   **Issue 1:**  A hidden service can be crashed by a malformed request from a client.
   *  **Issue 2:**  A client crashes while parsing a malformed hidden service descriptor.
   * **DoS-resistance issues**: Introduction points allow multiple INTRODUCE1 cells on the same circuit, leading to potential DoS. Hidden services excessively retry failed rendezvous circuits, causing computational overhead under heavy load. These are more DoS resistance issues than vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   *  **Issue 1:**  Denial of service for the hidden service. An attacker can effectively take a hidden service offline by crashing it.
    * **Issue 2:** Denial of service for the client. A malicious hidden service can crash clients visiting it.

**Attack Vectors:**
   *   **Issue 1:**  A malicious client sends a crafted request to the hidden service.
   *   **Issue 2:** A malicious hidden service provides a crafted hidden service descriptor.
    * **DoS-resistance issues:** An attacker sends multiple INTRODUCE1 cells, or creates a heavy load on the hidden service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Issue 1:** The attacker must be able to connect to a hidden service as a client, and have the ability to craft specific requests.
    *   **Issue 2:** The attacker must be able to control a hidden service and provide a malformed hidden service descriptor.
    *   **DoS-resistance issues**: Attacker must be able to create multiple connections to the hidden service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text includes links to Tor's issue tracker, which may provide additional technical detail for the vulnerabilities. The links are included in the text above.
*   The text mentions that hidden services should upgrade as soon as possible, which confirms the high severity of these vulnerabilities. Clients should also upgrade when possible.
*   The text identifies that the bugs fixed existed since Tor versions 0.2.1.6-alpha and 0.2.1.5-alpha.
