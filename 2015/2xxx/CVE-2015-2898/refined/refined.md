{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MEDCIN Engine contains multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient bounds checking and improper integer truncation in its message parsing functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)",
      "Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)",
      "Numeric truncation error leading to buffer overflow (CWE-197, CWE-680)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted packets over port 8190. This can lead to overwriting data in memory, leaking information, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network; sending specially crafted packets to port 8190 of the affected service.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication and can be remote, only network access to the vulnerable service is required."
