Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office Visio improperly handles objects in memory during UML parsing. Specifically, a malformed Visio file can cause data to be written outside of a normal buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- Buffer overflow vulnerability during UML parsing in Visio.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Visio process.
- An attacker could gain control of the affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights, if the current user has administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Opening a specially crafted Visio file.
- A user must be convinced to open the malicious file, typically through email or a malicious webpage.
- The attacker can send a specially crafted file to the user and convince the user to open it.
- The attacker can host a website with a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerabilities, and then convince users to click a link to that website, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant messenger message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to create a malformed Visio file containing a specially crafted UML structure.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious Visio file. This can be done through social engineering, like email or web-based attack scenarios.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office Visio.
-  User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
-  The vulnerability is classified as "Important" by Microsoft.
-  The ZDI advisory mentions that Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID 20632.
