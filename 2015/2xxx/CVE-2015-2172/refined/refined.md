Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the ACL plugin's remote API component within DokuWiki. Specifically, the plugin failed to verify if a user had superuser privileges before executing ACL addition or deletion actions through the XMLRPC API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core weakness is the absence of a check for superuser permissions before allowing modifications to ACL rules.
- **Insecure API:** The XMLRPC API, while marked as experimental, provided a means for unauthorized users to manipulate ACL settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with access to the XMLRPC API could elevate their privileges by setting their own ACL rules.
- **Circumvention of Access Controls:** This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or the ability to modify content, bypassing existing access control mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote API Access:** Exploitation is done by calling the XMLRPC API provided by the ACL plugin.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to the DokuWiki instance and the ability to interact with the XMLRPC API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **API Access:** The attacker must have the ability to make calls to the DokuWiki's XMLRPC API. This may require prior access or knowledge of valid user credentials to the API itself, as the API is not publicly accessible by default.
- **Trusted User not required:** The attacker doesn't need to be an administrator or superuser; any user with access to the API can exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The XMLRPC API is marked as experimental and is disabled by default.
- There is an additional safeguard by limiting API access to configured users and groups only.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered medium because it requires that the API be enabled and accessible to untrusted users.
- A fix has been released in DokuWiki version 20140929c.
- Users are advised to disable the XMLRPC API in the configuration manager as a temporary workaround.
