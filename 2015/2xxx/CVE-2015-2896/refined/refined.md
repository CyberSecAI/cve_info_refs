- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Up.time agent for Windows versions 7.6 and prior does not require authentication for built-in commands sent to its listening port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication for built-in commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can send commands to the Up.time agent and learn information, including the Up.time version, the underlying OS details, other running processes, and Windows event log information.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending unauthenticated built-in commands over the network to the Up.time agent's listening port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the network and be able to send commands to the Up.time agent's port, but does not require authentication.
