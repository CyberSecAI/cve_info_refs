Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2421:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This security feature is designed to randomize memory locations to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities by predicting the memory locations of specific instructions in a call stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a security feature bypass related to ASLR. The ASLR implementation in Internet Explorer is inadequate, allowing attackers to more easily predict memory addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass ASLR. This bypass doesn't allow direct code execution, but it significantly increases the reliability of exploits targeting other vulnerabilities, such as memory corruption issues. This means an attacker can more reliably execute arbitrary code on a target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is primarily through web browsing. The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick the user into visiting it using an affected version of Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a website or control a website that a user may visit, and they need to be able to craft malicious content on the webpage to exploit the ASLR bypass. The user needs to be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer and visit the attacker-controlled content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability itself does not lead to code execution but enables more reliable exploitation of other vulnerabilities by bypassing ASLR.
- Systems where web browsers are used frequently (workstations, terminal servers) are at higher risk.
- Servers are at risk if administrators allow browsing and email reading on them.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.
