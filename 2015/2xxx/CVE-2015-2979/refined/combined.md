[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:7.5
