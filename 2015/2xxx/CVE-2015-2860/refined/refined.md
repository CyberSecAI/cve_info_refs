- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper parsing of the `/help/` path in URLs to the Avigilon Control Center (ACC) Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can access any file on the server running the vulnerable ACC software.
- **Attack vectors:**  By crafting a malicious URL with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can bypass intended file access restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the ACC Server. No authentication is required.
