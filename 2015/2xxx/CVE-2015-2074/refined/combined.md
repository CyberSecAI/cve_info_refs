Unauthorized File Repository Server Write via CORBA

- - Original Advisory:
<http://www.onapsis.com/research/security-advisories/sap-business-objects-unauthorized-file-repository-server-write-via-corba>

4. Affected Components Description
==================================

Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.
It has components that provide performance management, planning,
reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.

Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact
with different platform services.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The BusinessObjects File Repositoy Server (FRS) CORBA listener allows
the writing of any file stored in the FRS without authentication. If the
attacker wishes to overwrite a file, the only requirement is that the
user know the name of the file in the FRS. For example,
Ã¢ÂÂfrs://Input/a_103/019/000/4967/1b14796c5b0d5f2c.rptÃ¢ÂÂ. With
knowledge of this filename, the user can write the file remotely without
authentication.

Note, using CORBA it is also possible to test if a directory or file
exists on the file system. Therefore, although unlikely, an attacker
could guess directories and then filenames brute-forcing files to
overwrite. This would be considerably easier with a predictable file
naming convention.

6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2018681 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2018681>

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
