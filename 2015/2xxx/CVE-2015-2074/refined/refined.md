Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2074

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the SAP BusinessObjects File Repository Server (FRS) CORBA listener allowing unauthorized file writes to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73):** The application does not properly validate or control the file paths, allowing an attacker to specify the target file for writing.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The FRS CORBA listener lacks proper authentication, allowing any remote attacker to interact with it and write files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Overwrite:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can overwrite any file stored within the FRS if the attacker knows the file's name within the FRS. This could lead to corruption of business data.
*   **Potential for Brute-Force Attacks:** Though less practical, the attacker can probe for existing directories and files by using CORBA to check their existence. If a predictable file naming convention is used, this process would be easier.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely, over a network.
*   **CORBA Listener:** The vulnerable point is the CORBA listener of the File Repository Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the target BusinessObjects server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of FRS File Names:** The attacker needs to know the target file's name within the FRS to overwrite it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SAP BusinessObjects Edge 4.0 and potentially other versions (refer to SAP Note 2018681).
*   The vulnerability is rated as high risk, with a CVSS v2 base score of 6.4.
*   SAP has released patches to address this issue (SAP Note 2018681).
