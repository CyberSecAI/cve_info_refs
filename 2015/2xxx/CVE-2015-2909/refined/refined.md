Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Dedicated Micros DVR products, including models like DV-IP Express, SD Advanced, SD, EcoSense, and DS2, have insecure default configurations. Specifically, they use plaintext protocols (HTTP, telnet, FTP) for communication and do not require authentication (username/password) by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data:** The use of plaintext protocols exposes sensitive data transmitted over the network to eavesdropping.
*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** The lack of default authentication allows unauthorized access to the DVR devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain complete control of the DVR device.
*   Attackers can view and manipulate sensitive data (potentially including video feeds).
*   Attackers can tamper with device settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The devices are accessible via network protocols, particularly HTTP, telnet, and FTP.
*   Attackers can scan the internet for vulnerable devices using tools like Shodan, identifying those with open ports and no authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable DVRs.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to access the vulnerable device.
*   No special skills or tools are explicitly required beyond basic networking knowledge and the ability to send commands via the exposed protocols.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vendor (Dedicated Micros) is aware of the issues and advises users to set passwords and enable secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH).
*   The vendor acknowledges that the system has no authentication by default on HTTP, Telnet, and FTP interfaces, and they do not provide default credentials.
*   The vendor states that the user is presented with warnings on the GUI to set usernames and passwords.
*   The CERT/CC recommends that vendors should provide systems that are reasonably secure by default rather than dependent on end user configuration choices.
*   Shodan results show that numerous Dedicated Micros devices are openly accessible on the Internet with no authentication.
