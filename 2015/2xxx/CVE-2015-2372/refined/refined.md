  "CVE-2015-2372": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the VBScript engine, when rendered in Internet Explorer, handles objects in memory. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of objects in memory by the VBScript engine.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted website visited via Internet Explorer.",
       "Embedded ActiveX control marked as 'safe for initialization' within an application or Microsoft Office document.",
      "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host or inject malicious content into a website, application or document.",
    "Affected software": [
        "VBScript 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 on Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2, and when rendered in Internet Explorer versions prior to 9"
    ],
    "Workarounds": "Restrict access to VBScript.dll using takeown and cacls commands to deny access to everyone."
