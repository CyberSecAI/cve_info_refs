## Analysis of CVE-2015-2866

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2866:

**1. Vulnerability Description**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Product:** Grandstream GXV3611\_HD IP camera
*   **Affected Firmware Version:** 1.0.3.6 and prior
*   **Location:** Username field of the telnet login

**2. Root Cause**

*   The Grandstream GXV3611\_HD camera does not properly validate the input provided in the username field during telnet login. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject SQL commands.

**3. Attack Vector**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing prior authentication.
*   **SQL Injection via Telnet:** The attacker injects SQL commands through the username field of the telnet login prompt.

**4. Impact**

*   **Configuration Modification/Disclosure:** An attacker can view or modify the device's configuration by injecting SQL commands.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The provided exploit changes all passwords to 'a', including the admin password, allowing login with the new password, and potentially allowing root shell access by leveraging a backdoor command that starts a telnet server on port 20000 with no password required.

**5. Exploit Details (from Exploit-DB)**

*   The provided exploit script uses the `telnetlib` library to connect to the target IP camera.
*   It injects the following SQL code into the username field: `';update user set password='a';--`
    *   This SQL code updates the `user` table, setting the password for all users to 'a'. The `--` comments out the rest of the original query preventing SQL errors.
*   The script then logs in as `admin` with the new password `a`.
*   The script then sends the command `!#/ port lol` which is a backdoor command to start the telnet server without authentication
*   Finally, it attempts to trigger a backdoor command (`!#/ port lol`) that enables a telnet server on port 20000, accessible without authentication as root.

**6. Remediation**

*   **Firmware Update:** Grandstream released firmware version 1.0.3.9 beta to address this vulnerability. Users should update their camera firmware as soon as possible.

**7. CVSS Metrics**

*   **Base Score:** 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
*   **Temporal Score:** 5 (E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)
*   **Environmental Score:** 3.8 (CDP:ND/TD:M/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

**Summary of Weaknesses**

*   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**
