{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User tainted data is used when creating the database query that will be executed on the database management system (DBMS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker might execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server with this vulnerability. An attacker can inject own SQL syntax thus initiate reading, inserting or deleting database entries or attacking the underlying operating system depending on the query, DBMS and configuration.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/clipbucket/view_item.php` with manipulated `item` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server."
