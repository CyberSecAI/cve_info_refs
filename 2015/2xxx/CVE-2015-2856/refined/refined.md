- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Accellion File Transfer appliance is vulnerable because it processes a user-provided 'statecode' cookie parameter as part of a file path when rendering an HTML template. This allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - File disclosure vulnerability
    - Directory traversal via the 'statecode' cookie
    - Lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the 'statecode' cookie
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read any file accessible to the web user, including:
    - System configuration files
    - Files uploaded to the appliance by users
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker crafts a malicious 'statecode' cookie containing directory traversal sequences (`../`) and a null byte (`\x00`).
    - This malicious cookie is sent to the server and used in the construction of the file path processed by the HTML template.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Accellion FTA server with a manipulated 'statecode' cookie.
