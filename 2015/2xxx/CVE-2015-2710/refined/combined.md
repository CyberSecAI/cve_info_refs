Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, privilege escalation or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 31.7.0-1~deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.7.0-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink discovered

multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2708](/security/CVE-2015-2708))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during the rendering of SVG

content with certain CSS properties in some circumstances. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2710](/security/CVE-2015-2710))

Scott Bell discovered a use-afer-free during the processing of text when

vertical text is enabled. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2713](/security/CVE-2015-2713))

Ucha Gobejishvili discovered a buffer overflow when parsing compressed XML

content. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message

with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2716](/security/CVE-2015-2716))

# CVE-2015-0816

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-0815.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-0817.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-0816 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0816)

#### Description

Mozilla Firefox before 37.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.6, and Thunderbird before 31.6 do not properly restrict resource: URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges by leveraging the ability to bypass the Same Origin Policy, as demonstrated by the resource: URL associated with PDF.js.

                 CVE-2015-2713 CVE-2015-2716

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser:  Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, privilege escalation or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 31.7.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.7.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, and the Network Security Service (NSS) is a
library implementing security features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5,
PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME and X.509 certificates. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as
‘Mozilla Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, NSS, NSPR, and
Thunderbird. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.22.2"

```

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Thunderbird binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-38.7.0"

```

All Firefox 38.7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Firefox 38.7.x binary package should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-38.7.0"

```

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0988)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2015-2708, CVE-2015-0797, CVE-2015-2710, CVE-2015-2713)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox processed
compressed XML data. An attacker could create specially crafted compressed
XML content that, when processed by Firefox, could cause it to crash or
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2015-2716)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Byron Campen, Steve
Fink, Aki Helin, Atte Kettunen, Scott Bell, and Ucha Gobejishvili as the
original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 38.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-48

## Buffer overflow with SVG content and CSS

Announced
May 12, 2015
Reporter
Atte Kettunen
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 38
* Firefox ESR 31.7
* Firefox OS 2.2
* SeaMonkey 2.35
* Thunderbird 31.7
* Thunderbird 38.0.1

### Description

Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher **Atte
Kettunen** found a buffer overflow during the rendering of SVG format
graphics when combined with specific CSS properties on a page. This results in a
potentially exploitable crash.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.

# CVE-2015-2712

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-2711.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2713.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2712 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2712)

#### Description

The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not properly determine heap lengths during identification of cases in which bounds checking may be safely skipped, which allows remote attackers to trigger out-of-bounds write operations and possibly execute arbitrary code, or trigger out-of-bounds read operations and possibly obtain sensitive information from process memory, via crafted JavaScript.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1220601#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-05-12 01:12:44 UTC  ``` Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte Kettunen found a buffer overflow during the rendering of SVG format graphics when combined with specific CSS properties on a page. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2015/mfsa2015-48.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Atte Kettunen as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1220601#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-05-12 18:50:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2015:0988 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0988.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1220601#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-05-18 09:04:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1012 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1012.html>   ``` |  |

SVG text bug --> heycam, can you take a look? We're walking off the end of the "mPositions" nsTArray in SVGTextFrame::ResolvePositions.
You don't need an ASAN build to reproduce this -- it triggers a fatal assertion (for out-of-bounds nsTArray access) in debug builds, too. (verified locally with testcase 2)Flags: needinfo?(cam)

Specifically, we write off the end of the array here:

> mPositions[aIndex].mRunBoundary = true;
> }
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/svg/SVGTextFrame.cpp?rev=41c005e9398e&mark=4403-4403#4380>
Here, mPositions->mHdr.mLength is 7, and aIndex is 7 as well.

DetermineCharPositions should generate an array whose length is the number of descendant characters in the DOM, regardless of display:none. It's returning an array of length 2 but it should be 3. If I remove the text::first-letter rule, then I do get a 3 element array.
The comment for TextFrameIterator, which DetermineCharPositions uses, says
\* Note that any text frames that are empty -- whose ContentLength() is 0 --
\* will be skipped over.
However, there is a recorded "undisplayed characters before frame" value on the empty text frame (1, for the undisplayed 'a'). We're not getting this value in the TextFrameIterator loop in DetermineCharPositions because we completely skip over the empty text frame.
So either we need to return that empty text frame from the iterator, or the TextNodeCorrespondenceRecorder needs to skip over empty text frames too.

The skipping of empty text frames was done in [bug 841174](/show_bug.cgi?id=841174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Out of bounds in nsSVGTextFrame2::DoAnchoring with svg.text.css-frames.enabled").

I think GetNonEmptyTextFrameAndNode needs to be updated to do the same test (checking the frame's content length, rather than the node's text length).

Critical. We can control how far off the end of the array we write by having any number of display:none single-character <tspan> children which have a ::first-letter applying to them. The kinds of things written include for example the values specified in the x="" and y="" attributes on the <text>.

> bool aInTextPath, bool& aForceStartOfChunk,
Hmm -- it seems a bit confusing & error-prone to have two functions with the same name, one of which returns nsresult and the other of which returns bool. Someone could easily call the nsresult one and check its return-value as if it were bool, by mistake ("if (ResolvePositions(...))"), and get the logic backwards as a result, since NS\_OK == 0 == false.
So, it seems like being consistent about a "bool" return type would be safer here, from the perspective of getting logic correct. (and being able to sanity-check the logic without thinking too hard)
(I also think nsresult is an overly complex return type, for a function that just wants to return a basic success/failure indication & doesn't need any NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS() error-type-propagation in its caller.)
Even so, the bool return values would mean slightly different (but overlapping) things; which would also be a bit confusing; maybe that's why you chose not to use bool here. But I think that'd be clearer if these two functions had slightly different names, so they were easier to distinguish -- maybe the helper-function should be called ResolvePositionsForNode(), since it takes a content-node and recursively processes that node?
So, tl;dr: I think both ResolvePositions funcs should return bool, and (perhaps in a separate bug) consider renaming the first one to something like ResolvePositionsForNode()

Two suggestions:
(1) MOZ\_ASSERTs without messages are a bit mysterious, unless it's dead-obvious why they must hold. There's some subtlety here (as shown by the existence of this bug), so I think this would benefit from an assertion-message -- e.g. "GetContentLength() should've been nonzero, if our node has text". (Not sure this is exactly true / what you're going for; tweak as-appropriate.)
(2) It seems to be crucial that we return true here in exactly the same conditions that IsNonEmptyTextFrame returns true. (That's what's behind the TextFrameIterator behavior you mentioned in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1149542#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in SVGTextFrame::ResolvePositions").) So, let's add an assertion to check this -- e.g.:
MOZ\_ASSERT(IsNonEmptyTextFrame(aFrame),
"Our logic should agree with IsNonEmptyTextFrame");
(Maybe even worth restructuring this function slightly, so we can check this agreement for the return true \*and\* return false cases, right when the function ends. e.g. instead of 'return false' / 'return true', set a local "bool isNonEmptyTF" to true or false, with a single final "return isNonEmptyTF" statement; and just before that return statement, we can assert that isNonEmptyTF == IsNonEmptyTextFrame(aFrame). Maybe that's overkill though.)

Maybe expand to "Return early from SVG text layout if [...]". Otherwise, it's unclear what region of code is actually changing.

Same with the "if" checks for the other unexpected-early-returns that you're adding in this function.
(And you'll need an #include "mozilla/Likely.h" in order to use that macro.)

Part 3: Crashtest. r=dholbert [DO NOT LAND until other patches have made it to all supported releases]
(This is for all three patches.)
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
If we just consider the first patch, then it's not clear from the code changes where the bug lies. Looking at the second patch, it's conceivable that someone could notice that this is enforcing the expectations around zero-length text frames, look at [bug 841174](/show_bug.cgi?id=841174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Out of bounds in nsSVGTextFrame2::DoAnchoring with svg.text.css-frames.enabled"), and start looking for a similar problem.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The test, yes, as you could easily open the test in a debug build and discover the out-of-bounds array writing.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
No, but this code hasn't changed much recently and ought to apply easily.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely; ::first-letter applying to SVG text content is relatively new in the SVG 2 specification and other browsers don't implement it yet, so it is quite unlikely anyone is relying on it.

You may want to just go ahead and push to inbound, even without aurora/beta approval. Given that we're not shipping a firedrill release for this, it doesn't really matter if we land this on inbound first or land it on all branches simultaneously, because our release users will still be vulnerable until the next merge.
> Please land only parts 1 and 2. Thanks!
When you're relying on someone else doing the landing, I'd suggest putting "DO NOT LAND" in the patch description for extremely-important-that-they-not-land-yet patches, to make sure this isn't missed. :)

Part 1: Return early from SVG text layout if we discover mPositions is not long enough. (v3) r=dholbert
Requesting aurora/beta approval on heycam's behalf, since I think he's out until tomorrow. (and we'd benefit a bit from getting this into aurora/beta today, per [comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1149542#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in SVGTextFrame::ResolvePositions"))
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: SVG Text; [bug 841174](/show_bug.cgi?id=841174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Out of bounds in nsSVGTextFrame2::DoAnchoring with svg.text.css-frames.enabled"). (Affects all branches)
[User impact if declined]: potential security exploit; see [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1149542#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in SVGTextFrame::ResolvePositions").
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: We have a regression test (attached) which we can land once users are patched. We have existing testcases for SVG text rendering; I'm not sure how comprehensive they are (heycam could comment more on this), but this is low-risk enough that I'm not concerned.
[Risks and why]: Low-risk from a security perspective -- "part 1" adds explicit length checks to prevent other out-of-bounds reads of this type. There's a small risk that this could break some SVG text edge-case that we didn't consider here, but I'd be surprised, because the patches are pretty targeted at making us more consistent & making sure we don't read past the end of an array.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

FWIW, mats asserted the following about tests on sec bugs, in [bug 1134667 comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1134667#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-buffer-overflow (read of size 4) at CanBreakLineBefore, inside of nsRubyBaseContainerFrame reflow"):
> Standard procedure is that we land testcases \*after\* the bug has been made

So if May 13 comes and for some reason we haven't made this bug public yet, probably best not to land the test (but maybe worth asking at that point if we're good to open the bug).

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1012)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-2708, CVE-2015-2710, CVE-2015-2713)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird
processed compressed XML data. An attacker could create specially crafted
compressed XML content that, when processed by Thunderbird, could cause it
to crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-2716)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Byron Campen, Steve
Fink, Atte Kettunen, Scott Bell, and Ucha Gobejishvili as the original
reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 31.7. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 31.7, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Security Advisories for Thunderbird

### Impact key

* Critical
  Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
  software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
* High
  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)

# CVE-2015-2721

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-2720.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2722.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2721 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2721)

#### Description

Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.19, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, Thunderbird before 38.1, and other products, does not properly determine state transitions for the TLS state machine, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by blocking messages, as demonstrated by removing a forward-secrecy property by blocking a ServerKeyExchange message, aka a "SMACK SKIP-TLS" issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1220607#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-05-12 01:19:04 UTC  ``` Security researcher Ucha Gobejishvili used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a buffer overflow while parsing compressed XML content. This was due to an error in how buffer space is created and modified when handling large amounts of XML data. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.    External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2015/mfsa2015-54.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ucha Gobejishvili as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1220607#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-05-12 18:50:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2015:0988 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0988.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1220607#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-05-18 09:04:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1012 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1012.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1220607#c4)  Huzaifa S.
