  "CVE-2015-2554": {
    "description": "Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The `NtCreateLowBoxToken` API allows the capture of arbitrary handles, including kernel handles, without proper validation of object types.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handle validation in `NtCreateLowBoxToken`",
      "Capture of kernel handles",
      "Lack of checks on object types for handles"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege, local denial of service, potential for maintaining references to kernel objects indefinitely, ability to re-open processes with their original session ID after logout, potentially leading to privilege escalation through session manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access with valid logon credentials",
      "Specially crafted application exploiting the vulnerability",
      "Creation of a lowbox token with a crafted handle table"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid logon credentials",
      "Ability to execute code locally",
       "Ability to call `NtCreateLowBoxToken` and other kernel APIs"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because `SepReferenceLowBoxObjects`, which is called by `NtCreateLowBoxToken`, uses `ZwDuplicateObject` to capture handles, which can be kernel handles. Additionally, it does not validate object types. A user can capture a thread handle and create an impersonation token using the resulting lowbox token, which maintains a reference cycle. When the user logs out, the process terminates but because the token maintains the reference cycle the process object itself will not go away. This can lead to a denial of service as the object is hidden from task managers and can not be terminated, or privilege escalation by re-opening the process and accessing its original token after relogging."
