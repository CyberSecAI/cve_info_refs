Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically win32k.sys) handles objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **Memory Corruption:** The root cause is related to incorrect memory management by the kernel-mode driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Install programs.
- View, change, or delete data.
- Create new accounts with full user rights.
- Take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required**: An attacker must first log on to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the targeted system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
- This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-2363, CVE-2015-2365, CVE-2015-2366, CVE-2015-2367, CVE-2015-2381, CVE-2015-2382) addressed in the MS15-073 security bulletin.
