Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the SAP Business Objects software when handling CORBA requests. Specifically, the `clearData` CORBA operation, which is intended to remove audit events from a queue, does not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The core weakness is the missing authentication requirement for the `clearData` operation, which allows unauthorized users to invoke it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Deletion of Audit Information:** An attacker can remotely delete audit events that are waiting in the auditee queue. This means that these events will not be recorded in the audit database, effectively concealing the attacker's actions.
*   **Covering Malicious Activity:** By removing audit logs, attackers can conduct malicious activities without being detected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **CORBA Interface:** The attack is carried out by sending malicious requests to the BusinessObjects service through its CORBA interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target BusinessObjects service.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They can send the malicious CORBA request without any prior authorization.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects SAP Business Objects Edge 4.0 (refer to SAP Note 2011396 for more detailed information on affected releases).
*   The vulnerability only affects audit events that are in the queue and haven't been written to the database yet. Existing audit records in the database are not impacted.
*   SAP has released a patch for this vulnerability (SAP Note 2011396).
