irl@...e.org sent us a confirmation without a Cc to oss-security.

The CVE mapping is:

Use CVE-2015-2927. The known affected version of node (aka LinuxNode)
is 0.3.2 (for Debian, the "ax25-node" package name is associated with
the "node" source-package name). Within the URONode changelog, the
relevant entry is apparently "21/05/08 v1.0.5r3 ... I added a
quit_handler routine in the main loop which now will execute a
node_logout(), flush out the IPCs, log the event to syslog, and close
out the application properly."

> app fails to close and more can be spawned by a crafty malicious

This does not have a CVE ID. The node software was not attempting to
defend against a scenario in which a single client user causes
arbitrarily many node processes to run on the server simultaneously.
The node software runs as a service under inetd (or a similar
program), and any related restrictions would ordinarily be part of the
inetd configuration. Lack of restrictions is a site-specific problem.

("crafty malicious user" means, for example: if a client were allowed
to have 100 simultaneous node processes, the malicious user could
choose a request timing that ensured that 100 processes were always
running.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1209781#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-08 08:19:08 UTC  ``` The following issue was found in node:  The SIGQUIT routine fails to close the app leaving the IP sockets open and in some cases DDOS the remote site if a user "ctrl-]+q" out of a telnet session. Also the app fails to close and more can be spawned by a crafty malicious user thus bringing the system to a point of no memory available.

```
Package: ax25-node
Version: (all)
Severity: important

Dear Maintainer,

The SIGQUIT routine fails to close the app leaving the IP sockets open and in
some cases DDOS the remote site if a user "ctrl-]+q" out of a telnet session.
Also the app fails to close and more can be spawned by a crafty malicious user
thus bringing the system to a point of no memory available. I found this in
2005 with Barry K2MF and we incorporated a patch for MFNOS to prevent this from
attacking MFNOS.

Found this was the situation in ALL linux-based ax25 node packages. Patched
this in URONode and informed ax25-node upstream in 2007. No acknowledgement of
my email received to date.

Suggest replacing ax25-node with URONode for security reasons as other distros
have done.

I will move this up my list of things to look at.

I am aware of the problem, but currently lack the time to start new
packages. I hope for this to improve in the coming month.

Please note that Debian is currently in a freeze and so new package uploads
will not be included in jessie, which does mean that this is not entirely
urgent from the Debian perspective.

If you have a patch that can be applied to the ax25-node package, this could
be included into jessie although the patch should be minimal in size and be
purely to fix the security concerns.

Thanks,
Iain.

Colin was going to consider putting this into Debian but due to the
freeze he could not. You can sync up with him on this. He did ask me to
refile a bug report I filed years ago... this is it.

Time is something of a luxury for me as well.

If I can draft one I will but as with time it's quite precious for me as
well. Tomi's code is a bit different than that in URONode.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I have a candidate package built to address bug 777013 (and so the associated
CVE).

I would like some testing to be done by other users to verify the problem
of the ax25-node program hanging on SIGQUIT has been corrected.

The candidate package can be found at

<https://people.debian.org/~pouelle/>

An amd64 version of the binary is there, as well as the source.

If this package works, it will be uploaded to testing as ax25-node_0.3.2-8.
