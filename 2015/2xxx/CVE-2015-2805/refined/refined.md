Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2015-2805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch management web interface lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The web interface does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms. This means that an attacker can craft malicious web pages that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, will perform actions on the switch via the administrator's session.
*   **Predictable POST Parameters:**  The HTTP POST requests used to create users and modify their access privileges have predictable parameters. This allows an attacker to construct the necessary malicious requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** An attacker can reconfigure the switch.
*   **Unauthorized User Creation:** Attackers can create new administrative user accounts on the switch, granting them full access. This allows for persistent access even if the original administrator's session expires.
*   **Full Switch Access:** Successful exploitation could result in the attacker gaining complete control over the switch.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted web page. This page contains hidden forms that submit HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable switch.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Switch IP Address:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target OmniSwitch.
*   **Administrative User Session:**  An administrator must be logged into the switch's web interface in the same browser used to visit the malicious web page.
*   **Ability to Host a Web Page:** The attacker needs to host the malicious web page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides concrete examples of HTTP POST requests used to create a user and modify their permissions.
*   The advisory includes a proof-of-concept HTML page demonstrating the attack.
*   Affected products include a range of Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch models: 6450, 6250, 6850E, 9000E, 6400, 6855, 6900, 10K, and 6860.
*   The vulnerability affects all releases of AOS versions 6.4.5.R02, 6.4.6.R01, 6.6.4.R01, 6.6.5.R02, 7.3.2.R01, 7.3.3.R01, 7.3.4.R01, and 8.1.1.R01.
*   Workarounds include disabling the web interface or using a dedicated browser for switch management.
*   A fix was expected in the form of a firmware upgrade by the end of July 2015.
*   The advisory assigns a "medium" security risk due to the requirement of tricking an administrator and knowing the switch's IP address, although the impact is high.
