Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `wp_ajax_save_item()` function in the WonderPlugin Audio Player plugin does not properly sanitize the `$id` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the `is_id_exist()` function. Additionally, user-supplied input in `item[name]` and `item[customcss]` are not sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the `$id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This can lead to information disclosure or data manipulation.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied data within the `item[name]` and `item[customcss]` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the browsers of other users of the website. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or further compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials.
    - Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, potentially damaging the site's content or functionality.
- **XSS:**
    - Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Defacement: Attackers can inject malicious code to modify the site's content and appearance.
    - Further Compromise: Attackers can use XSS to execute further attacks against website visitors, such as redirecting them to malicious websites or launching phishing campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `wp_ajax_save_item()` AJAX action available at `http://wordpress-url/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The attacker sends a POST request to this endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code through the `item[id]` parameter.
- Similarly, the attacker injects malicious JavaScript in the `item[name]` and `item[customcss]` fields for XSS exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, although does not require admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to perform a blind SQL injection and XSS attack.
- The SQL injection example uses a time-based approach, causing a sleep if the condition is met, allowing for data exfiltration.
- The XSS example injects a simple JavaScript alert for demonstration purposes.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability affects all pages with shortcode wonderplugin_audio.
