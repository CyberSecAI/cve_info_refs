{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Mono TLS implementation had a client-side SSLv2 fallback.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The presence of SSLv2 fallback makes the system vulnerable to attacks that exploit the known weaknesses of the SSLv2 protocol. SSLv2 is considered insecure and should not be used.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially exploit the SSLv2 fallback to downgrade the connection to a less secure protocol, allowing them to potentially intercept or manipulate the communication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a client attempting to connect to a server using TLS. If the server (or a man-in-the-middle) forces the connection to fallback to SSLv2, the attacker can then exploit known vulnerabilities in the SSLv2 protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would either need to be in a man-in-the-middle position or be able to control the server to force a fallback to SSLv2."
