{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MediaWiki feature that allowed a user to preview another user's custom JavaScript would execute the script within the previewing user's session.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, privilege escalation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious code into another user's custom JavaScript which, when previewed by a higher privileged user, would execute in the context of that user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to hijack the session or perform administrative actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A low-privileged user adds malicious JavaScript to their custom script. They then trick a higher-privileged user (e.g., an administrator) into previewing their script, which triggers the malicious code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a MediaWiki user capable of editing their custom JavaScript. They must also be able to persuade a higher-privileged user to preview their script."
