- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect memory allocation in `TPInt.dll`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory manipulation issues leading to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A guest OS (in Workstation) or a View desktop (in Horizon Client) may be able to execute code on the Windows host OS running the respective product, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by the processing of data within the virtualized environment, and is exploitable by an attacker within the guest OS or View desktop.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have control over the guest OS running within VMware Workstation, or the View desktop in the case of Horizon Client.
