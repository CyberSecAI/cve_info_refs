Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The D-Link DAP-1320 Rev Ax firmware update mechanism does not properly sanitize the firmware download location received from the server. An attacker can manipulate the XML response containing the firmware download URL to include shell commands which will be executed on the device during the update process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary weakness is the improper neutralization of special elements within the firmware update process. By injecting malicious code into the URL used for the firmware update, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The device fails to validate or sanitize the firmware update URL received from the server, allowing the injection of commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially take full control of the device, including reading sensitive information, modifying configurations, and using the device for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker must intercept and modify the network communication between the device and the D-Link server when the device is checking for a new firmware.
- **Malicious Firmware Update:** The attacker injects the malicious command into the firmware download URL within the server's response.
- **User interaction required:** The user must initiate the firmware update using the web interface in order for the malicious command to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the vulnerable D-Link device and the update server.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device to perform this attack. If the attacker can authenticate, they could perform this attack without a legitimate user needing to initiate the firmware update.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects D-Link DAP-1320 Rev Ax devices with firmware versions 1.11 and prior.
- Firmware version 1.21b05 and later resolves this issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mike Baucom, Allen Harper, and J. Rach of Tangible Security.
- The attacker can potentially compromise the device completely.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 10.0, which is the highest possible score indicating a severe risk.
