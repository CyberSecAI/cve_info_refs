Original Release Date: 2015-03-16 | Last Revised: 2015-03-16

---

### Overview

The D-Link DAP-1320 Rev Ax firmware update mechanism contains a command injection vulnerability.

### Description

| [**CWE-78**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**  A remote unauthenticated attacker may execute commands on the device by taking advantage of the firmware update mechanism. This attack does require interception and manipulation of network communications using commonly available tools.The D-Link DAP-1320 Rev Ax firmware version 1.11 (released 22 Dec 2013) has been shown to be vulnerable. Other firmware versions prior to version 1.21b05 may also be vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may execute commands on the device by taking advantage of the firmware update mechanism. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update the firmware**According to D-Link's [security advisory](http://securityadvisories.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10050), users should update the firmware of affected devices to version 1.21b05. |

SAP10050

DAP-1320 - Rev Ax - Command Injection - FW 1.11

**Publication ID:** SAP10050

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 12 February 2015 10:02 GMT

**Last updated on:** 20 March 2015 4:10 GMT

**Overview**

D-Link has received a report that an attacker who is able to intercept and modify the DAP-1320's traffic while a user is checking for new firmware through the web UI will be able to inject commends in the server's response.  Injected commands will be executed if the user attempts to update the DAP-1320's firmware through the provided dialog.

CERT Vulnerability ID :: [VU#184100](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/184100)

NIST Vulnerability ID :: [CVE-2015-2050](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2050)

**Details**

When the DSP-1320 checks for the availability of new firmware, it pulls an XML file from a D-Link server.

If an attacker is able to intercept and modify that request, the XML file that is returned could been modified by an attacker to indicate that an updated firmware is available, and to include an injected command in place of the firmware's download location.

The user would then be presented with a dialog indicating that new firmware is available for their DAP-1320.

If the user instructs the DAP-1320 to upgrade to that version using the dialog on the DAP-1320, the attacker's command will be executed.

If the attacker has local network access and is able to authenticate to the DAP-1320, they could perform this attack without assistance from a legitimate user.

**Affected Product**

| Model Name | HW Version | Vulnerable FW Versions | Current FW Versions   (include fixes) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAP-1320 | Ax | v. 1.10 and Before | Current Firmware :: v1.21b05  Patched Firmware :: v1.21b01 |
