Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2974:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file upload processing within Gazou BBS plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The application fails to adequately validate uploaded files, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML File Upload: Attackers can craft malicious image files that, when uploaded, are interpreted as HTML files. This allows them to inject arbitrary HTML into the application.
- Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): By uploading malicious HTML, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application, leading to XSS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for user authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to access the application's upload feature remotely.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a crafted image file designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Gazou BBS plus versions prior to v2.36.
- It is caused by inadequate validation of file uploads.
- Attackers can upload malicious HTML files by disguising them as image files.
- Exploitation does not require user authentication.
- The primary impact is the potential to modify the content of the application through uploaded HTML, potentially leading to XSS.
