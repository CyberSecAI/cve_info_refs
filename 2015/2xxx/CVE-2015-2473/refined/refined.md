  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol client improperly handles the loading of certain specially crafted DLL files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of DLL loading by the Windows RDP client.",
      "DLL planting vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker places a specially crafted DLL in the target user's working directory.",
      "The attacker convinces the user to open a specially crafted RDP file.",
	  "Web-based attack: hosting a website with a malicious RDP file or leveraging a compromised website to host the malicious RDP file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded and convince the user to open a specially crafted RDP file. For web-based attacks the attacker needs to host a malicious rdp file or leverage a compromised website.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the RDP client attempts to load a DLL, and the attacker can control which DLL gets loaded by placing a crafted one in the working directory. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows RDP client loads certain binaries."
