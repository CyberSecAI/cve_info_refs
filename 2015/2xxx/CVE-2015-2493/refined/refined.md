Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-2493:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way that the VBScript and JScript engines handle objects in memory when rendered in Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in VBScript and JScript engines.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Internet Explorer.
- Attackers could also embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" within an application or a Microsoft Office document that hosts the Internet Explorer rendering engine.
- Compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content or ads could also be used to host the malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or inject the malicious content into a website that the victim might visit or be tricked into visiting.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content, typically by tricking them into clicking a link or opening a malicious attachment.
- No specific privileges are needed beyond being able to host a website or inject content into one.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer 8.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the VBScript and JScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.
- Microsoft had no indication that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when the bulletin was released.
- There are workarounds involving restricting access to the `vbscript.dll` and `jscript.dll` files. However, these workarounds may cause websites that use VBScript or JScript to not work properly.
