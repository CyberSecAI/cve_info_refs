Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in Mozilla Firefox's failure to properly enforce the referrer policy when a user opens a link using a middle-click or the context menu. Specifically, the browser does not respect the `<meta name="referrer">` tag in these cases, leading to the possibility of exposing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Referrer Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the referrer policy specified by a website through the meta tag. This policy is meant to control how much (or whether) referrer information is sent along with a navigation request.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The behavior was inconsistent; the referrer policy was respected when navigating a link using a regular click but was ignored when opening via middle-click or context menu.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information. By ignoring the referrer policy, a website might inadvertently leak private data that is included in a URL to an untrusted third party by using the HTTP `Referer` header. For example, a URL containing personal information such as a session ID, a userâ€™s name, or details about a private resource could be exposed in web server logs of the destination web server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network by an attacker hosting a website with a link that, when opened via a middle-click or context menu, bypasses referrer policies.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to interact with a malicious link on a website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to control a web server hosting a malicious webpage which contains links to an external server.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open a link on the attacker-controlled website via middle click or context menu.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was specific to Firefox and SeaMonkey browsers
*   The fix involved propagating the referrer policy throughout the UI code, ensuring that links opened through middle-click and the context menu also abide by the referrer policy set by the originating website using the `<meta name="referrer">` tag.
*   This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 38.
*   This is a "low" severity security issue
*   Exploitation is "remote"

The content from `bugzilla.mozilla.org` provides significantly more detail about the discussions and development process involved in addressing this vulnerability than the official CVE description. It includes:
*   Detailed technical discussions between developers on the root cause and possible fixes
*   Multiple patch iterations and code reviews
*   Specific code areas affected, including browser.js, nsContextMenu.js,  TabParent.cpp, and ContentRestore.jsm
*   The complexity of testing and ensuring proper behavior, especially with different browser configurations (e10s enabled/disabled)
*  Debate over whether to ship a broken feature or delay implementation
*   Concerns of whether the vulnerability could be detected through feature detection mechanisms of major websites (like Facebook)

The provided content from `security.gentoo.org` confirms the vulnerability is related to Firefox and the fix is upgrading to versions >= 38.7.0.

The information from `www.suse.com` confirms the vulnerability and provides the fixed versions for various SUSE Linux products.
