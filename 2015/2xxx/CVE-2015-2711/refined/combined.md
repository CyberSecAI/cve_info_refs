# CVE-2015-2712

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-2711.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2713.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2712 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2712)

#### Description

The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not properly determine heap lengths during identification of cases in which bounds checking may be safely skipped, which allows remote attackers to trigger out-of-bounds write operations and possibly execute arbitrary code, or trigger out-of-bounds read operations and possibly obtain sensitive information from process memory, via crafted JavaScript.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, and the Network Security Service (NSS) is a
library implementing security features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5,
PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME and X.509 certificates. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as
‘Mozilla Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, NSS, NSPR, and
Thunderbird. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.22.2"

```

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Thunderbird binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-38.7.0"

```

All Firefox 38.7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Firefox 38.7.x binary package should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-38.7.0"

```

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.38 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=news&mref=origin> .
Middle-click on "Creating reality: How TV news distorts events" from ERIC to open the link in a new tab.
On the ERIC page, open the console and type document.referrer to see HTTP Referer.
2. Repeat 1, but left-click on the ERIC page to open it in the same tab, not a new tab.
3. Repeat 1, but from plain HTTP - <http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=news&mref=origin> .
Actual results:
1. document.referrer is empty - incorrect, HTTPS -> HTTP in a new tab ignores meta referrer.
2. document.referrer = "<https://scholar.google.com>" - correct, HTTPS -> HTTP in the same tab respects meta referrer.
3. document.referrer = "<http://scholar.google.com>" - correct, HTTP -> HTTP in a new tab respects meta referrer.
Expected results:
1-2. document.referrer = "<https://scholar.google.com>".
3. document.referrer = "<http://scholar.google.com>".
Basically, it appears that the meta referrer implementation in [Bug 704320](/show_bug.cgi?id=704320 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement <meta name=\"referrer\">") is incomplete. When the source page is HTTPS, following a link to an HTTP page in the same tab respects meta referrer, but opening a link in a new tab does not. Both cases respect meta-referrer when the source page is plain HTTP.
(Ditto for mref=unsafe-url - this is respected from HTTPS in the same tab, but not in a new tab.)

Presumably the front-end code handling the middle-click needs to set the referrer policy (based on the meta tag), not just the referrer.Product: Core → Firefox

It's the same with and without e10s. Tried Aurora (doesn't support e10s) and Nightly (e10s enabled and e10s disabled). All three clear Referer in this case - opening a link from HTTPS to HTTP in a new tab, with meta-referrer set to "origin".Flags: needinfo?(averstak)

Two issues here:
1. UI code - \_loadURIWithFlags() in browser.js - doesn't pass referrer policy to docshell, because it knows docshell as nsIWebNavigation whose loadURI() doesn't have a referrer policy parameter. It's a direct call without e10s, and a sequence that leads to restoreTabContent() in ContentRestore.jsm with e10s; both call webNavigation.loadURI() at the end.
2. Links opened via the context menu get no referrer at all, because \_loadURIWithFlags() is passed the following as referrer: (a) chrome://browser/content/browser.xul for "Open link in new tab", and (b) undefined for "Open link in new window". This looks like a bigger issue; it strips Referer for websites that do nothing special - plain HTTP, no meta referrer. (Stable and aurora pass Referer in this case; nightly doesn't.)
To address #1, we could do the following:
A. Add a function that passes referrer policy to nsIWebNavigation, e.g., loadURL2().
B. Add referrer policy to nsIDOMDocument. Or rather make the one already in nsIDocument.h scriptable.
C. Propagate B to A - handleLinkClick() in browser.js gets the doc from event.target.ownerDocument, then calls openLinkIn() -> loadOneTab() -> addTab() -> \_LoadURIWithFlags(), which eventually calls into nsIWebNavigation. Likewise for the context menu - \_openLinkInParameters() in nsContextMenu.js gets the doc and fills in the params to openLinkIn(), etc. (This would only propagate the referrer policy; fixing referrers in #2 is a separate issue.)
Thoughts? Better alternatives?

This is [bug 1118502](/show_bug.cgi?id=1118502 "RESOLVED FIXED - New rel=noreferrer logic breaks insert related tab after current"). Affects current DevEdition/Nightly, and we're already tracking it to ensure it is fixed before we hit release.

I don't have a great sense of the severity of this issue. It seems like something we can follow-up to fix in 37 despite shipping <meta name="referrer"> in 36, but maybe it would be preferred to delay shipping the feature entirely until this bug is fixed?Flags: needinfo?(sstamm)Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

IMHO it's better to ship the feature and fix this later. It's an edge case that behaves as if the feature didn't exist so it's not any worse than before, and sites can start to benefit from the feature in the majority of normal use .Keywords: [privacy](/buglist.cgi?keywords=privacy&resolution=---),

I personally don't think something as common as middle-clicking a link is an "edge case". I would guess that >10% of my navigations via links are in a new tab.

+1 for shipping meta-referrer in 36. FWIW, it wouldn't be entirely without precedent - <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=124750> :-)
Would be good to mention the caveats in the release notes - this bug, and also [bug 1113438](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113438 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta referrer> origin-when-crossorigin sets incorrect referrer"), which is already fixed in 37.

I think it's fine to ship <meta name="referrer"> without this bug being fixed, as long as we plan to fix it at some point...
Note that this bug \_does\_ mean that we'll send referrers in some cases when the page asks not to, so it's not quite as low-priority as [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click") makes it sound.

Seems that people are happy with shipping the feature with that bug. So, not tracking.
If you have a safe fix, this could land in beta 9 (go to build tomorrow).

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

Actually, it is \*much\* worse than complete lack of <meta name=referrer> support. Websites such as Facebook use feature detection to detect <meta name=referrer>, and when the feature detection indicates that it is supported, then they use direct links to third-party content, relying on meta referrer to strip sensitive information from the referrer URL. When the feature detection indicates the <meta name=referrer> is not supported, they use their own tricks (e.g. redirects) to ensure the sensitive information is stripped.
With this bug, their feature detection will detect <meta name=referrer> support, so these websites will not strip the sensitive information from the referrer URLs when linking to untrusted third-party content.
By the way, where was the intent to implement/ship thread for this feature? As far as I can tell, there wasn't one. So, I'll just point out here that the editor of the spec for this feature has already acknowledged that some of the issues I raised in the webappsec mailing list regarding this feature are significant and that major changes to the spec are likely, which is another reason it may be wise to hold back.

OK. Seems that there is actually no consensus on this.
So, I see three potential solutions:
\* Disable the feature
\* Ship anyway
\* Fix the bug (or workaround)

Ack, yeah, sorry. That slipped through my fingers. Owen had been generously working on it for a very long time and when I picked it up to finish it I totally forgot to post the intent.
As Brian said, the spec is not complete or perfectly stable. I wanted Firefox to provide a reference implementation to shake out any additional deployment issues with the spec sooner rather than later (which is why I pushed to get it done before the spec went to LC). Most of the issues are going to be deployment issues, and it's important to give web devs something to try out. There are, indeed, still things up for debate in the WebAppSec WG. See for instance this thread:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2015Feb/0147.html>
To Gavin: I think we should fix this bug, and \_not\_ disable the feature in the meantime. We should be moving forward, not backwards, especially so we can find and fix more bugs like this sooner rather than later (and also shake out implementation problems in the spec).Flags: needinfo?(sstamm)

Sure, but performance improvements at scale is the real value of this feature and that's easiest to test once it's in released versions of browsers. Devs can try it out in Aurora and extrapolate perf gains, but really what they want to know is what effect it will have on actual server load when their users' browsers can employ the feature.
In hindsight it may have been wise to hold in Aurora until the spec went to LC, but it's out now, shouldn't we really just fix the bug? Regardless of how the spec changes, this bug will still be an implementation flaw and need to be fixed.

I don't understand why this bug requires us to un-ship a feature. This is not a bug in the spec, it is a bug in our implementation and we should fix it. We should not blame my failure to catch this referrer-policy-application case on the spec. If we fix this bug, Facebook's problem goes away, right?
While I totally agree with Brian that feature detection can be problematic, it is a problem with all optional security features; regardless of any spec state, if there's an implementation bug in a security feature that a web site doesn't know about and they rely on the feature, then it could cause security failures. Seems to me we just need to fix the bug (this bug is a flaw in our implementation).
Regarding spec churn: I believe Brian is referencing this message[0] from Mike. From what I can tell from the WG discussion, the major change that will happen has to do with combining policies (i.e., changing the referrer policy after applying one). Right now any attempt to combine policies shuts referrers off entirely. Any change to this would be "more generous", referrer-wise. Maybe I missed something else that is more concerning and would warrant turning off the feature in the meantime?
Mike, do you anticipate the spec will change substantially such that current implementations will be less secure or incompatible with the future revision of the spec? Do you think sites' security would suffer if they start using the meta referrer we implemented in Firefox?

We haven't shipped this feature yet, unless I'm missing something. I'm questioning whether we \_should\_ ship it in the current state, as opposed to holding it one more cycle or modifying it so it can't be detected for the moment.

I'm all for "fixing this bug and moving forward", but:
a) someone needs to do that (can you take it, Sid?)
b) we can't realistically fix this bug in the 36 time frame, so unless we take other measures, we're going to end up shipping <meta name="referrer"> in Firefox 36 with this bug. That sounds acceptable to me, but it sounds like maybe we should reach out to known potential users, like Facebook, and warn them about it. Probably also worth a note in the release notes/MDN.

/me facepalm... yes, sorry, you're right. I see more clearly now.
I don't think it's terrible to ship with this bug, and getting it out there in more browsers will cause more good than harm. From what I've heard out of Facebook and other implementers, much of the use-case for meta referrer is for subresources (for things like embedded games or third-party widgets), not clicked links.
So I'm with Gavin. We can fix it quickly and target 37 (especially if Alex is willing to help -- Alex: you've been tremendously helpful on the other referrer stuff). And we should put a release note in 36 with this "known bug". If it helps, I'm willing to do a mea culpa post on the security blog to say "oops, missed this thing, but don't worry we will fix it quickly".
If we want to do a last-minute tweak to 36 to make sure this thing doesn't get abused, we could (just for 36) prefix the feature to be like:
<meta name="moz\_referrer" instead of <meta name="referrer"
but I don't think that's necessary.Flags: needinfo?(sstamm)

I'd still like to understand what sort of detection Facebook does. Because say we ship with this relnoted. What do we expect them to do? UA-sniff the browser version? That's generally something we try to avoid forcing people to do....

We have this as a new feature for 36 [1]. Marking this bug as a know bug would give the impression that we are shipping broken feature. I am not sure it is what we want to do...
Worst case scenario: 37 is just 5 weeks after the 36 release... (and no Mea culpa to do)

Sid - I should be able to help with this, but it'd probably take me several weeks to get to it, due to travel and schedule constraints. If you want it done sooner, someone else should pick it up. No rocket science here, just a bit of parameter propagation - see [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").
Shipping meta-referrer as-is in 36 (prefixed or unprefixed) would let me make Scholar HTTPS-only in Firefox, as it already is in Chrome and Safari. I don't know how representative my use case is, but here's one concrete example of security improvements that this feature would enable here and now.
Re feature detection - the only way I can think of that would also work in Webkit is to load an iframe and check its document.referrer. So, if compatibility is a major concern... let's not go there, it'd be saner to just ship it with a prefix. :-)

Attached patch

[WIP](attachment.cgi?id=8563141&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8563141&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8563141)

Thanks, Alex.
I ran out of time before getting around to testing or writing a test, but I had a thought; what if we take the NetUtil.applyReferrerPolicy implementation in [bug 1073187](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073187 "RESOLVED FIXED - add referrer policy support to Downloads.jsm"), and then instead of propogating the referrer policy into nsIDOMDocument, just obtaining the referrer policy in browser.js and calculating the "effective referrer" there.
So taking the patch in [attachment 8552570](/attachment.cgi?id=8552570 "bug1073187_netutil") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8552570&action=edit "bug1073187_netutil") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8552570&action=diff "bug1073187_netutil") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1073187&attachment=8552570) on [bug 1073187](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073187 "RESOLVED FIXED - add referrer policy support to Downloads.jsm") (which we can probably land whenever), then applying this patch on top, I think we can:
\* get the referrer and referrerPolicy from the doc
\* compute the effective referrer
\* stuff that (instead of the full referrer) into the params object (via handleLinkClick)
\* use the effective/computed referrer when calling the various loaders in browser.js
It's basically what you said in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click"), Alex, but instead we can compute and use the referrer higher in the stack instead of modifying nsIDOMDocument.
Does this look like a reasonable approach, Gavin? I won't be able to follow through and finish this until next week (I'm taking off for 4 days of vacation in just over 24 hours) but I can at least try to get it started.

But then you'll probably need to also propagate the "don't mess with referrer" flag, which would defeat the point of doing it this way? E.g., consider an HTTPS -> HTTP link with referrer=origin. If you propagate referrer=<https://just.host> then wouldn't it get stripped at the end, because it's a downgrade? That would be incorrect - referrer policy is supposed to override the defaults, which could make it more restrictive, or less restrictive.

But if you could pick some intermediate call site X and make sure that everyone upstream of X always passes it effectiveReferrer, then X could propagate (referrer=effectiveReferrer, referrerPolicy=unsafe-URL) downstream. This might work, and would probably still look a lot cleaner than propagating referrerPolicy all over town.
The catch is that "everyone upstream" may be a fairly large set - {middle-click, context-menu, download, save-as, print} come to mind. They should all be changed at some point, but it may not be a good idea to lump them all into the same patch.

Brian (Hi, Brian!) is probably referencing his proposal at <https://briansmith.org/referrer-01.html>, and my response at <https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2014Dec/0027.html>. I've said similar things, possibly more strongly, in other more recent threads. I do think we need to make some wider changes to the referrer spec.

I do anticipate changes to the spec. As I noted on the WebAppSec mailing list, I think Brian's general proposal is awesome, though I think it goes significantly further than is feasible in a number of areas. I do think we'll end up taking on several of his suggestions soonish (sorry, I've been distracted with CSP and MIX topics recently; I hope to get back to referrer in the near future).
In particular, splitting navigational referrers from subresource referrers is important, but I imagine that being implemented in a way that allows the current syntax to retain it's meaning (e.g. `<meta name="referrer" content="origin">` could be desugared into something like `<meta name="referrer" content="navigational-origin subresource-origin">`. My hope would be that current implementations would retain meaning in whatever new world we come up with.
However, I think his suggestion to drop `<meta>` entirely is unlikely to fly. Chrome and Safari have had `<meta>` support for years, and it's in wide use. I can't imagine that Chrome will change it's `<meta>` implementation in a backwards incompatible way in anything like a near-term timeframe.Flags: needinfo?(mkwst)

Yeah, I see. Thanks for the example. To do this right, we probably need to propagate it all the way through to where the channel is created.

How feature detection is typically done is mentioned in my proposal [1]. See [2] and [3].
There are serious problems with how meta referrer is specified, which are also pointed out in my proposal. In particular, the way mixed content is handled doesn't make sense at all.
I agree with Mike West that browsers that ship <meta referrer> will need to find some way to cope with existing web pages depending on it. They may struggle to do so, depending on how much the spec ends up changing. I'm hoping and expecting it will change \*considerably\*. If Mozilla wants to paint itself into the same corner that Google and Safari have painted themselves in, that's up to Mozilla. But, IMO, it would be better to actively participate in resolving the issues with the referrer draft spec and implement those fixes before activating the feature. Note that Mozilla just sent its first (AFAICT) contribution for improving the referrer control spec \*last week\* and that reviewing (and implementing?) a reasonable referrer policy seems to be a Q1 goal for the security team, according to [4]. IMO, it makes more sense to evaluate and decide upon a policy for referrer control \*before\* shipping a copy of Google's existing policy (which, it seems, will also change), instead of after.

Mozilla's decisions about the feature are, of course, Mozilla's to make. I'll note, however, that the `<meta>` implementation is widely used, and has solid performance and privacy benefits. I think it would be a shame if Firefox continued to force pages who require control over the `referer` header to push users through redirects to achieve it.
While I continue to agree with Brian that the Referrer Policy spec needs some work, I think we differ on the scope of that change, and in particular about whether or not it will continue to be backwards compatible with existing `<meta>` usage. Even if there was general agreement that `<meta>` should be deprecated, it's unlikely that we'll be removing it from Chrome in anything resembling near-term given that it's been in relatively wide use for ~3 years.
All that said, I'd echo Brian's call for comments on the spec. I do hope we'll make some real progress on it in the next few weeks, now that we're wrapping up CSP2 and MIX1.

I'm not advocating that Mozilla never implement referrer control. I'm advocating that Mozilla avoid shipping a referrer control mechanism in its next release where the implementation is significantly broken (the feature detection logic documented on stackoverflow and by Facebook gives misleading results that will lead some websites to do unsafe things) and where the specification has some significant flaws.
I don't think this is the place to debate how much the specification is likely to change. But, it is pretty clear that the specification is going to change significantly. I know that some people think my original proposal goes too far and I've already started a second revision based on Google's and Mozilla's feedback that addresses the concerns. Mozilla is also making proposals now.
I fail to see how the likelihood of it being painful for Chrome to remove or change its meta referrer implementation is an argument for rushing an implementation of the same into Firefox. Rather, I see it as an argument for making sure that the wrong thing doesn't ship in Firefox in the first place, to avoid that pain completely.

Also, this type of scenerio is why Mozilla has this policy:

I suggest that Mozilla stick to its own policies here. Then we could have this discussion in the Intent to Ship email thread.

> I am following Gavin's call on this
With all due respect, I don't think Gavin is the right person to make unilateral calls on web-facing features.
I agree with Brian: this needs to be disabled, at least for purposes of detection, on 36 for now, and we need to have an intent to ship. I filed [bug 1134606](/show_bug.cgi?id=1134606 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable <meta referrer> handling on 36 pending an actual request to ship process").
It looks like detection is done via use, so we need to actually disable entirely.
I will prepare a patch to do so, but this is NOT making me a happy camper in terms of people effectively owning their own stuff.

One other thing: we also have referrer control via CSP in 37. That presumably also has the issue described in this bug, though possibly not the spec-side issues...

Yeah, disabling is the right thing for 36. I'm working on a fix for this bug, but am strapped for time and it's turning out to be more complicated than I initially expected. Would still appreciate Gavin's feedback on the WIP.

Attached patch

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8568280)

Adding a WIP patch for the testcases because I do need some help figuring out what's going on.
Here is how the test works:
\* I based the test on another test which I wrote a while back [1] but essentially performs the same task, we register a clickHandler, intercept the click and perform a call to gTestWin.contentAreaClick().
\* In the other testcase [1], that strategy works fine.
\* In the attached patch (in the clickHandler)
> aEvent.target = [object XULElement],
whereas (as the other test [1] shows), the
> aEvent.target = <http://mochi.test:8888/browser/browser/base/content/test/general/file_meta_referrer_testserver.sjs>
I don't know why and where that happens, but apparently this difference causes us to enter this branch [2] and hence not to perform the actual click.
Any help is highly appreciated!
@Gijs: I followed your suggestion, and tried to not register a clickHandler but instead 'faking' a eventObject and calling
> gTestWin.contentAreaClick(aEvent, true);
with that eventObject. Unfortunately I had to give up on that solution, because faking all the different objects within that event object became to cumbersome.
Thanks for any help - also, I am happy to rewrite the test if there is an easier solution to accomplish the same task, but at the moment I don't think there is. For all recommendations, please keep in mind that manipulatively we need tests for:
\* Ctrl-click
\* ctrl-drag and drop
\* right-click open link in new tab
\* middle click

You should waitForFocus(aTest, gTestWin.content) in the waitForSomeTabToLoad callback in setupTest. The other test does an executeSoon and waits for a load, \*and\* loads another tab manually before trying to click the link.

Thanks Gijs - I wouldn't have figured myself. Surprises my that you can do a document.getElementById("") which returns the right thing but you can't perform the click on it. Thanks anyway, it works now!Flags: needinfo?(gavin.sharp)

To solve the timeout, can you just split them into three test files (one for each case)? I'd rather have more test coverage here than less, given the complexity of the feature.

@Christoph: it'd be best if you could take this over - I'm short on time. A few things you might want to consider:
1. nsIWebNavigation::loadURIWithBase should probably be renamed to loadURIWithOptions and changed to take an options struct, similarly to nsIDocShell::loadURI. A JS util function could convert the JS params dict to this struct, to make it easier to call. (Changing nsIWebNavitation::loadURI seems like a non-starter - too many call sites; but changing loadURIWithBase sounds like a good idea - it's a subset, it's new, and it's only used in view-source.)
2. I only tested this with multi-process. Not expecting any issues with single-process, but it certainly needs to be run through - single-process is using different browser & webNavigation objects.
3. The test should probably also cover origin-when-crossorigin. Current tests cover propagation of the referrer policy, but not of the triggering principal. It works, probably via some global state, but the test doesn't cover it. A single same-origin case should be sufficient - if it uses the wrong triggering principal, it would truncate referrer to just origin.
(As an aside, if I were to pick just one test case for this bug, that would be HTTPS -> HTTP with meta-referrer=origin. It would catch both failure to propagate the referrer policy, and also failure to trump the default policy. My second choice would be origin-when-crossorigin, to test propagation of the triggering principal. My third choice would be rel=noreferrer, to test that it trumps the meta-tag. And then the cross-product of the default referrer policy cases - they're certainly most important, but also least likely to break. As Sid says, the more the merrier, but if there's need to prioritize tests, those would be my picks.)
4. There's also save-as, view-source, and print. And metro and maybe other forks (android?). I'd file separate bugs for those - the scope of this one is already plenty large enough.

Thinking more about it, renaming loadURIWithBase to loadURIWithOptions is probably a good idea, but passing a struct here seems like more boilerplate than it's worth. Since all the non-trivial usage is from JS, it'd be simpler to write a JS wrapper that takes a params dict and calls loadURIWithOptions with the long complete list of parameters.

Did a bit of manual testing with single-process too. Works fine.
Leaving the rest in Christoph's able hands.

Hey Sid,
I factored out the common code and extended the tests to cover the following policies:
\* origin
\* no-referrer
\* no-referrer-when-downgrade
\* origin-when-crossorigin
\* unsafe-url
The tests cover going from:
\* http->http
\* http->https
\* https->https
\* https->http
Further, the tests include coverage for:
\* simple left clicks
\* right-click -> open link in tab
\* ctrl-click
When thinking about it there are other scenarios as well, not sure if we need automated tests for those as well:
\* drag and drop the URL into a new tab
\* drag and drop the URL into a new window
\* use keyboard navigation to open the link (e.g. using tab and then hitting ctrl-enter
Let me know what you think - all the tests work fine with Alex patch applied.
@Alex: Thanks again for providing the patch, I will follow your suggestions and finalize your work.

That is a good point - I will incorporate such a test once I get feedback from Sid.

I agree, this bug already covers a lot by itself.

Attached patch

[bug\_1113431\_referrer.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8569532&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8569532&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8569532)

Sid: I rebased Alex's patch and (for now) I just replaced loadURIWithBase to loadURIWithOptions. Even though I like Alex's suggestion in [Comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click") to use a struct that we can hand to loadURIWithOptions I am not sure if we want to introduce that change at the moment given that we have to uplift the change to 37.
I already had to rebase the patch and probably lots of things changed between 37 and now. In other words, I am worried that we introduce other problems if we perform too big of a change.
Currently loadURIWithOptions takes 7 arguments, which is not too bad in my opinion.
Anyway, I think the patch looks great by itself. What do you think?
Also, Alex left some comments in the code - can you also have a look at those and tell me what you think? e.g. saveURL.
So far this looks good, the patch passes all the automatic tests we have at the moment, but probably we should add some more (see my previous comment when I uploaded the latest test patch).

Please use a referrer policy constant/enum instead of "0" here.

Since this is an implementation of a semi-public interface, it's probably a good idea to do validation of the aReferrerPolicy argument value before setting loadInfo so we don't end up with some weird referrer policy value.

Maybe clearer to use a constant/enum or explain why you're sending zero for this argument.

@Christoph - I have my evenings back, and can wrap this up if you prefer. Please let me know. My strategy would be to clean this up per Sid's comments, and to file followup bugs for anything that's non-trivial to do or to unittest. Hoping that this makes it into 37, with some time to bake on the beta.Flags: needinfo?(mozilla)

Alex, that's great - please do. I had everything on TRY the other day and seems tests time out:

The good news, your patch seems to work just fine. So, I am going to break the tests yet again (also including some same origin tests).
I will leave you patch untouched - thanks for doing all this - you are awesome!Flags: needinfo?(mozilla)

I don't think this is a good place to do validation. It's just another stop on the long train to the http channel. E.g., one could easily bypass it by QI'ing webnav to docshell and filling loadInfo directly.
Validation, if any, probably belongs all the way in HttpBaseChannel::SetReferrerWithPolicy, because that's the first and only function that does something useful with the value.
Thoughts?
Addressed all the other review comments. Will slice it into smaller patches and send them out shortly.

[accept referrer policy in webNav.loadURIWithOptions](attachment.cgi?id=8572479&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8572479)

Renamed webNav.loadURIWithBase (added recently in [bug 464222](/show_bug.cgi?id=464222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Relative links not linkified in \"View Selection Source\"")) to loadURIWithOptions and added the referrerPolicy argument. Updated various wrappers and the only real call site - view-source. Added an implementation to the e10s version.

Other alternatives:
1. requestLongerTimeout(240) at the top of test().
2. Reduce the number of test cases - see [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").
3. Parallelize the loads of the source pages, e.g., load them all into one tab with lots of iframes. There'd still be 40 tabs/windows to open one-at-a-time after that, but at least it wouldn't open each source page in its own new tab too - so it should be 2X faster.

accept referrer policy in webNav.loadURIWithOptions
I'm not familiar with the background of loadURIWithBase, but assuming it is relatively new and that there are no compatibility issues with renaming it (including from possible use in add-ons), renaming it seems fine. I agree this is a better name.

bz reviewed both [bug 704320](/show_bug.cgi?id=704320 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement <meta name=\"referrer\">") and LoadURIWithBase, so would be better to get review from him.

Full description in [comment 64](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c64 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click"). Added Document.referrerPolicy and nsIHttpChannel.REFERRER\_POLICY\_DEFAULT per request from Gijs.
Compatibility-wise, loadURIWithBase was added on 2014/2/20, and I updated all the references I could find on mozilla-central. Not sure how to check the addons - <https://mxr.mozilla.org/addons/ident?i=loadURIWithBase&filter>= seems to require an AMO admin account. I could, of course, easily add another function and leave this one alone, but my gut feeling is that it's not necessary here.

@Christoph - would you mind if I take over the tests too? I'll still bug you to submit a try run - I don't have committer access - but I think it would be more efficient for a single person to own the bug.
If so, can you please upload the latest tests? The patch here doesn't seem to have open-in-new-window. This would save me a bit of time.
My strategy with tests would be to reduce the total number of cases to about twenty, per [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click"). Opening a new tab takes several seconds on a debug build; doing this 40\*4 times just doesn't seem to be worth it. I think we'll get nearly all the benefit by testing propagation of two pieces of info - referrer policy and triggering principal - which can be covered with a small number of test cases. There's little, if any, benefit from testing every combination of protocols and policy values - the UI code merely passes them on to the http channel, which is already covered by all-combinations tests.

Indeed, this isn't called. That being said, I am worried about the add-on compat of the browser changes here... I'll have a look at that when I review (soon now, promise!).

Probably makes sense to stick that in a temp var so as not to make this fn call completely unreadable.

Because this is "private" (underscore prefix), I don't think we should make the function signature ugly just to avoid this (and even if we did, it'd likely mean tabmixplus would \*still\* need work to get the referrer policy thing right), but I'll add keywords and CC the author.

Why are you falsy-checking aOpener.document.referrerPolicy? I guess it's equivalent now because of the ||, but if the default were different, this would ignore the int being set to 0 (which is also falsy in JS).
Let's instead do:
var referrerPolicy = Ci.nsIHttpChannel.REFERRER\_POLICY\_DEFAULT;
if (aOpener && aOpener.document) {
referrerPolicy = aOpener.document.referrerPolicy;
}
Which should always work, AIUI.

That's a little bit of a can of worms, because it's toolkit... but I think you could probably make it take the same kind of object as you've written here, and call webNavigation.loadURIWithOptions instead of just loadURI.
This does make me wonder how you tested this change. We know from previous mucking about with aNoReferrer that our automated tests here are deficient and we break stuff when we change pretty much anything. These are already pretty big patches so I feel a little bad asking it, but if you \*could\* write \*some\* tests, at least, that would make me feel better.

Sid and I discussed that yesterday and since the bug needs to be uplifted, we would like to have tests for all the different combinations (basically what we have at the moment). Plus, we would also need one for same origin (as you mentioned previously) which is not included in the current tests.
One other reason why we want all the combinations is that we could eliminate the original tests or at least convert them to fit into this new 'referrer test suite' we are about to create with this bug.
But we can ask Sid again to make sure! Sid?Flags: needinfo?(mozilla) → needinfo?(sstamm)

It all works. :-) With and without e10s.
Tested by hand - middle-click and open-link-in-new-{tab,window,private-window} from the context menu with various referrer policies, then printed document.referrer on the console. See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").
Also ran Christoph's excellent automatic tests - see his tests patch on top. We need to trim these tests down a bit because they take too long, and cover interaction with rel=noreferrer. But they actually do test exactly this bug.
You might want to apply the two patches and try it out yourself. It's quick to test by hand - see [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").
Will address detailed feedback and upload another version in the evening, when I have a bit of time. Thanks for the lightning fast review!

I'm a noob here, so I have a very basic question - how long is too long for a UI test? Suppose it takes ten minutes overall. Is it reasonable to just shard it into ten 1-minute tests? Or do I have to worry about the try-bot's overall capacity at this point? How much of the overall try-bot capacity can I reasonably use for these tests - is there a guideline / limit? Does it even run different UI tests in parallel, or am I going to slow down everyone's try runs by ten minutes no matter how the test is sharded?
Asking this because the http channel tests are much faster to run than the UI tests. The channel tests can load lots of iframes in parallel, but the UI tests are limited to one click at a time, which takes several seconds per click. If we're running up against the overall time limit, then it would make more sense to keep the exhaustive tests in the http channel, and keep the UI tests small and focused.
Also, keep in mind that adding interactions with rel=noreferrer will double the current test time. And then someone's gonna land the referrer attribute, which would be another 3X. And then there will be referrer CSP or something... I'm afraid that no matter what the time limit is, all-combinations UI tests will exceed it soon enough.
Sid - thoughts?

Do this. Doesn't add a whole lot to do the exhaustive tests in an expensive way when we can check completeness in an easier way and spot-check using the UI tests. Also the tests run on every check-in, so adding 10 min to the tests gets expensive quickly.
You can just spot-check rel=noreferrer too, don't need to be overly-complete since the "overrides" logic should be the same code path for many of the cases.Status: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(sstamm)

Alex: I did some more manual testing and it 'seems drag and drop into a new tab' doesn't propagate the referrer. I will try to add an automatic testcase for that today. For now, I will use my current testsetup and then I let you incorporate the test into your setup. The integration should be fairly simple, I guess finding out how the drag and drop works automatically is the harder part.
Any chance you an you take a look at your patch and try to find out why it's not propagating for drag and drop operations?Flags: needinfo?(averstak)

@Christoph - IIRC, the drag-and-drop code path doesn't propagate referrer at all, even in the normal meta-referrer-less same-origin HTTP->HTTP scenario. My patch didn't change this; it seems unnecessary.
If that's something we want to reconsider, it would be best to file a separate bug. The code change should be trivial, but I'm not sure that we want to do this from the policy perspective. Actually, I'm pretty sure that we don't - neither FF35 nor Chrome41 currently set referrer on drag-and-drop, even with meta-referrer=always. This seems to be working as intended; but please do file a separate bug if you disagree.
(OTOH, if you have an automatic test that covers drag-and-drop, I'd love to include it, and test that there's no referrer in this case.)Flags: needinfo?(averstak)

I guess the webnav change is OK. Chances are not many binary things are using that API yet, and addons mxr shows no JS uses.
For the webidl change, though that return value should not be nullable. The fact that it even compiles that way doesn't make me terribly happy, though I haven't figured out how to prevent it yet...
Please make it non-nullable. sr=me with that.

Yes, you are right. I should have looked at the code first but nevertheless, I don't understand why:
\* right click - open link in new tab, and
\* drag and drop into new tab
are semantically any different and why one propagates the referrer and the other does not.
Anyway, I will follow up with Sid and others and I think we have to file a follow up to get that fixed so that both of these cases propagate the referrer.

I am attaching a testcase that tests drag and drop operations. Just a few notes:
\* I had to copy in a few helper functions from:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/newtab/head.js#495>
to make it work - unfortunately we end up having some duplicate code, but I think that's ok for testcode.
\* Using 'todo\_is' when performing the actual test - we have to update that, see the following link for any help:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mochitest#Test_functions>
but I think the tricky part of the test is already there.
Please let me know if I can be of any more help - thanks again for taking on that work.

It appears to call the loadURIWithOptions variants in tabbrowser.xml. The one in toolkit/.../browser.xml was never called during my manual testing with various ways to open new tabs/windows. Non-e10s calls the version in the @tabbrowser-browser bindings; and e10s calls a combination of @tabbrowser-remote-browser and @tabbrowser-browser - they're both in tabbrowser.xml and are both updated in this patch. (I don't know how this works internally; I just added a bit of logging to track down which functions get called.)
I could update browser.xml too, of course, but I don't know how to test that? Nothing that I've done triggered that code path. I added logging to it too, but never saw it log.

Yes, and they're good tests too, see [comment 77](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c77 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click") & Christoph's patch. Will send you the tests patch when it's ready - sorry, didn't have time to finish this tonight.

Ah, d'oh. Sorry, I should have realized that. You're right. I can tell you how it works: they are extensions of the default binding, and they are applied to the browsers that we create in tabbrowser through this bit of CSS: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.css#49>

Hmmmmm. For regular Firefox, this is not strictly necessary. For toolkit, it will be, I think.
I wonder how all this should work with view-source URLs. You can click links in those, and I expect they will use the regular toolkit browser binding, though I've not checked. I also don't know if the referrer policy of the original document does/should apply to the view-source document. (Though I expect it currently doesn't... not sure if that's an issue, and/or how much we care here.)
The other things that use regular browsers will probably still want updating... but we can leave that for a followup. We'd need to audit the relevant code (I suspect at least sidebars, social and Firefox Hello, off the top of my head). This patch is big enough as it is.

Unless there is a real pressing reason to ship the feature in 37 (more than [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click")), given that the change looks non trivial, that it hasn't landed on m-c yet, and that we're already past the cutoff for slight risk in the shorter 37 cycle, I would prefer that we disable the feature again in 37 (like [bug 1134606](/show_bug.cgi?id=1134606 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable <meta referrer> handling on 36 pending an actual request to ship process") did for 36) and target 38.

@bz - that doesn't compile; it would need to be called ReferrerPolicy which is also an enum. I could add a thin wrapper called ReferrerPolicyFromJS to follow existing convention, but there doesn't seem to be a good way to avoid binarynames entirely. Tried removing the typedef and using fully qualified mozilla::net::ReferrerPolicy, but that looks inconsistent with the rest of this code. Thoughts?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

View-source doesn't seem to call browser.xml either, but I just went ahead and changed that anyway. It's a backwards compatible change; and it would be odd to have different interfaces for different browser objects. Also added a comment to one of the three versions in tabbrowser.xml - it doesn't look like it supports a params object, but it actually does.

It gets an empty referrer from view-source, which seems just fine to me.

All right, followup it is. I wouldn't even know all the places to look at... :-)

Adopted from Christoph's excellent patch. Narrowed down from 20 to 6 key cases, so it should be fast enough now. Added plain-jane cases, interaction with rel=noreferrer, and a same-origin origin-when-crossorigin test. Skipped drag-and-drop for now - ran out of time. All four tests pass locally on linux-debug, and take 70-90 seconds a pop.

Can we put these in their own folder? "general" has something like 300 tests and if we keep dumping in there that will never improve... :-)
Also, I'm a little concerned that we're limiting the tests because of timeouts... Equally, I don't have quick fixes to split the tests up further, short of numbering them and splitting the test suites.
The actual bad news (besides nits/comments below) is that this won't run in --e10s mode, and ideally we shouldn't really add the tests before we've fixed that. However... it seems that the test relies on itself calling contentAreaClick. I don't know why it does that and why it can't rely on the browser's own handling here. I don't think we can call the equivalent e10s stuff ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/content.js#640> ) because that just defines an object as a local variable. We'd have to change that and stick it on |this| in order to access it from another content script...
It seems like the "simple\_click" code doesn't need to do this, though. Can we investigate fixing the content menu case to also not need more motivation than just synthesizing the click? :-)

How long is too long, even with sharding? See [comment 78](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c78 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").

Removed the call to contentAreaClick, I'm not sure why it was there either.
But I have a more basic problem in e10s - waitForFocus() doesn't, says "child process window cannot be focused". Will poke around when I have a bit of time. This is even in the simple click test.

Attached patch

[test cases - click, ctrl-click, new-{tab,window}](attachment.cgi?id=8575445&action=diff) (obsolete)

WIP. Addressed Gijs' style comments. Made logic clearer. Still no cigar with e10s, but for a different reason - waitForFocus() doesn't like me somehow.

How?
You probably need to ensure that you either pass it a chrome window when calling it in a chrome process, and that you can access the function and have it work and pass it a content window when calling it in a content process.

Ah. So any machine will only run one test in parallel (mostly because browser\_ tests are basically integration tests that (in some cases) rely on OS-level focus and such, so parallelizing them is... not easy), so no need to worry about that.
AFAIK the only issue is ensuring that (debug/asan) tests (comfortably) complete within the timeout limit on the hardware we use. So yes, splitting in 10 \* 1min tests is totally an option from that perspective.

I don't know what you mean here, although I guess you're saying there are unit tests for the underlying DOM/HttpChannel bits? That's nice, but it's still valuable to have the tests in this patch considering that in fact, those existing unit tests are passing but in practice the browser isn't doing the right thing. :-)
One thing we could potentially do is that rather than the integration-test-type approach the tests use, to directly call methods and ensure that they call the underlying DOM/webidl stuff with the right parameters as a result. But in the absence of a good mocking tool, that is difficult, and it would be quite tightly coupled to the current implementation, and will make it easy to miss stuff - both of which will make them less future-proof as tests go.

(sorry for missing this comment initially)
Looking at this, it's likely because you're asking for a content window in aTestWindow, and SimpleTest.waitForFocus tries to find the browser for the window by asking the tabbrowser element in its own window, which obviously isn't going to work (wrong chrome window).
This is an issue with waitForFocus. See:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/c42e7e3bb0a0/testing/mochitest/tests/SimpleTest/SimpleTest.js#l823>
Asking around there doesn't seem to be a way to determine the toplevel chrome window from the content window in e10s land. There are two possibilities:
a) add a param to pass the chrome window
b) write another inner function to get the parent window by looping over the windows of type "navigator:browser" using something like:
let wm = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator);
let windows = wm.getEnumerator("navigator:browser");
while (windows.hasMoreElements()) {
let win = windows.getNext();
let tabbrowser = win.gBrowser;
// see if the tabbrowser knows about the inner window, and if so, return that window.
}
// Nope!
Does that help?

... or you could wait for [bug 1131656](/show_bug.cgi?id=1131656 "RESOLVED FIXED - waitForFocus needs to handle content process windows in a different window") to be fixed (and/or apply that patch for now). :-\

Attached patch

[test cases - click, middle-click, new-{tab,window}](attachment.cgi?id=8575868&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8575868&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8575868)

Mostly works in e10s now.
1. The new-window e10s version spins at 100% CPU for a few minutes during shutdown, and then complains that it leaked 16 bytes in WeakReference<MessageListener>. I'm getting a funny feeling that opening new windows is not well covered by e10s tests, and this is something totally unrelated to my changes... Am inclined to disable new-window in e10s and file a followup bug; the other three tests run fine.
2. I'll make you more test cases once you're happy with the basics. Don't want to iterate on the full enchilada - current set is 3min non-e10s + 7min e10s; full set would be 7X more cases - so, an hour. Definitely too slow for iteration. Actually, do you still want it at all? Yes, I can shard it, but running locally would still take an hour...

You probably don't need to select the tab, but OTOH it'll help with debugging on try if it fails there (the screenshot will show it if it did open and then timed out / stopped / whatever), so let's leave it in.

In fact, so is this... which almost makes me wonder if you can factor this out into head.js, too. :-)
When you refactor this, can you please get rid of the param but add a gTestWindow global in head.js and stick the window on there? You can then also add a:
registerCleanupFunction(function() {
gTestWindow && gTestWindow.close();
});
in head.js to ensure we always close the window even if the test fails halfway through or whatever.

This seems too trivial to need an extra file and all this setup. Instead of doing this, try using ContentTask:
return ContentTask.spawn(aWindow.gBrowser.selectedBrowser, {}, function() {
return content.document.getElementById("testdiv").textContent;
});
should work, off the top of my head?

Alex, can you doublecheck this? interdiff:

I also changed doc.referrerPolicy to gContextMenuContentData.referrerPolicy in nsContextMenu.js (that's the only hunk for that file), but the interdiff tool is too dumb to figure that out because the context changed and so it can't apply both diffs.

Re test case coverage - this is the existing "channel test" I was referring to earlier:
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/test/test_bug704320.html?force=1>
It covers the full cross product of {source-scheme, target-scheme, policy}. But it triggers navigation from content, not from chrome. So, it's more than just a unittest, it covers everything other than chrome event dispatch (which is this bug).
Given the existence of this other test, my 6-case / 10-minute strategy in the latest tests patch is to verify that (a) chrome gives the channel enough info to do its job, \*not\* that (b) the channel does its job for all possible inputs. Either stance has reasonable philosophical arguments going for and against it. It's probably not necessary to go there because I think we can resolve this on practical grounds; but I'd just like to point out that there's method and merit to my test strategy - it's the result of a different systematic approach, not of cutting corners.
The practical matter, of course, is how long these tests take to run, and how we expect this to grow over time. Currently, a full cross-product would be 2 (source) \* 2 (target) \* 6 (policy|none) \* 2 (rel=noreferrer) = 48 cases. So, we're talking 10 minutes (mine) vs. 80 minutes (cross-product) of machine time. Other cases that could reasonably be added in the future are the 6 CSP referrer values and the 3 referrer attribute values (I'm not sure of the implementation status, but both are in the spec, and bugs to implement them exist). At that point, we're talking 18\*48 = 864 cases = 15 hours.
Still think cross-product testing is a good idea? If you do - fine, I'll fold my tent and implement the cross-product. Just making sure you know what you're asking for, because you're going to get it. ;-)
(Re recent code review comments - thanks, will rebase and address them when I'm home later tonight. Thanks for the blazingly fast reviews - this is really helpful.)

Un-bitrotted browser patch (pass referrerPolicy from content process in e10s contextmenu case)
This doesn't quite work in e10s - open-in-new-tab needs another line in tabbrowser.xml to propagate the referrer policy; and open-in-new-window drops the referrer completely in all cases, AFAICT (by no fault of this patch - passing nsIURI to window.arguments is broken somehow, but a string works). I'll send a counter-patch.
(BTW, my tests caught both of these bugs, and quickly. Just saying... ;-)

Counter-patch - unbitrotted, plus a minor line in tabbrowser.xml, plus changed window.arguments to propagate a string instead of nsIURI - the latter gets lost somehow, but a string works. Works in manual testing and passes automatic referrer tests.

Addressed review feedback. All pass both with and without e10s.
Pending issues with tests:
1. Coverage / strategy - see [comment 114](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c114 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click").
2. Leaks. I get this intermittently with and w/o e10s, and am inclined to just ignore it:
TEST-INFO | leakcheck | default process: leaked 3 WeakReference<MessageListener> (48 bytes)

FWIW, I did run the tests after I wrote the patch - but only in non-e10s mode (which was also broken before). D'oh. I'll look at the changes in more detail hopefully later today, but potentially it may have to be tomorrow as I'm a little overbooked this afternoon + evening.

Yes. They reuse their own document.referrer, so there's no privacy / security issue.
(My goal is to help fix issues that reasonably block shipping of meta-referrer, so that I can get rid of plain http and silly redirectors on my website...)

I'm inclined to ignore this. The problem case is the following - an https source, with meta-referrer=origin, links to an http target. Then, the user does "open frame in" on the target. It would ignore the referrer policy of the source, i.e., use the default no-referrer-on-downgrade policy, so it would strip the referrer completely. But correct behavior would be to keep <https://source>.
I could file a followup bug, or I could just set the referrer policy here to unsafe-url w/o automatic tests, but somehow I just don't think this matters. It's reusing its own referrer, so it can only over-strip it, not under-strip it. Which means it's not a privacy / security issue, which means leaving it like this forever is probably just fine.
Thoughts?

Ugh, human language. So confusing sometimes ("it's reusing its own referrer" - which? pre- or post-stripping?). AIUI, your argument is:
given page A containing a frame with page B:
i) page B was already opened with referrer of page A, subject to A's referrer policy, because it was opened in a frame of page A (right?)
ii) if we open page B in a new tab/window, the logical thing would be for the referrer to still be A, again subject to A's referrer policy
iii) for this case, we currently apply the default of no-referrer-on-downgrade, and the only case where that is problematic from a security/privacy perspective is when the referrer policy of page A allows passing (more of) A's URL to B then no-referrer-on-downgrade does.
You're saying that the opposite of (iii) (that is, "under-stripping" the referrer, so leaving too much of it where it really ought to be stripped down further to either origin or none) isn't possible. Is that really the case?
Let's say both A and B are https:, and A specifies referrer policy of "none". AIUI, B-in-a-frame gets no referrer info. However, right now, we pass all of A's URL to B when B is opened in a new tab/window, right? (AFAICT this is the case when A and B are both http:, too)
I'm assuming I'm missing something, but I'm not sure what. :-)
Even if I haven't missed anything, this can still be a followup because I think it's more of an edgecase than opening links - but \*if\* I'm right, we do need to do something.

Nit: is it possible to have less wonky indentation here? I've noticed that you stick to a conservative characters-per-line limit (not a criticism!). Personally, I'm not fussed until you go over something like 120, so I would just put the function() { on the previous line, but I appreciate that opinions may differ. :-)
If you would prefer not to, one other option would be passing:
checkReferrerAndStartNextTest.bind(null, aTestNumber, null, null, startSimpleClickTestCase)
as the callback, or using a temp var somewhere. My brain is just confused by a function body that is less indented than the start of the function. :-\

Nope. We pass B.document.referrer, which is already empty; not A.document.documentURIObject, which is the full URL of A.
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js#925>

<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/content.js#161>

All fine, except a race on linux opt e10s in the open-in-new-window test:
03:44:29 browser\_referrer\_open\_link\_in\_window: policy=[undefined] rel=[undefined] http:// -> http://
03:44:30 must wait for load
03:44:30 must wait for focus
... logging from unrelated addons code ...
03:45:13 Longer timeout required, waiting longer...
It opened the window and loaded the target:
<http://mozilla-releng-blobs.s3.amazonaws.com/blobs/try/sha512/ec315ae00685fd5d73a946c9b18e6559f0ec290a5c833fd3c79dcdda043ddfd3dfbe7fba70317fbd90dbcc609597344369d0e282383970644088a55987783850>
...but didn't call me back the way I expected. Ah, life is like that. One more version is coming right up...

Attached patch

[test cases - click, middle-click, new-{tab,window}](attachment.cgi?id=8577368&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1113431&attachment=8577368)

Exfoliate waitForFocus from the test - it appears to race with the new tab load in linux opt e10s. Replace it with the "load" event when waiting for a new window to open. Remove it from the other places too, we don't seem to need it.
Another try run? (Sorry to keep bugging you...)

I am skeptical about your change to remove the focus handling here. I also just realized you could use promiseFocus() (or perhaps it needs to be SimpleTest.promiseFocus; not sure) here in the previous version. In any case, I'll push to try in a sec.
Also, instead of this load handler, perhaps use:
delayedStartupFinished(newWindow).then(resolve);
?

Err, scratch that. We don't actually need focus on this window anyway. :-\

Well, I would have, but we're in the middle of a treeclosing window. Will try to do it afterwards (should be finished in 1 hour or so, if my timezone math is right), or tomorrow. If there isn't a link here monday, please yell at (needinfo) me.

I'm happy to do another try run, but in any case, you still need review on the dom/docshell/embedding/netwerk changes before this can land, I think?

Ack! I'm so sorry for the long delay, Alex. :( bz sr+'ed the interface bits, and that's most of what this patch does: update the interface call-sites. The rest looks good to me, but unfortunately I'm not a DOM or DocShell peer so I can't technically r+ it.
jst: I would r+ this if I could. Can you help?

Minor nit: can you use a more meaningful constant instead of 0 so it's clearer? I'm thinking: Ci.nsIHttpChannel.REFERRER\_POLICY\_DEFAULT like in RemoteWebNavigation.jsm.

Looks like all the ducks are in a row - time to land this on M/C.
Last try run:

(I'm not sure what the process is for landing this on 38 too; assuming this is a separate step, and that someone knowledgeable will chime in. That would probably also require the patches from [bug 1133577](/show_bug.cgi?id=1133577 "RESOLVED FIXED - [e10s] \"Open Link in New Tab\" in remote browser causes unsafe CPOW usage warning").)Keywords: [checkin-needed](/buglist.cgi?keywords=checkin-needed&resolution=---)Version: 36 Branch → Trunk

Once the patch is merged to mozilla-central safely, the next step is to request approval‑mozilla‑aurora from the attachment details page (you can do it for just one of the three patches here). That will auto-fill in a little questionnaire to be filled out explaining the rationale, <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Uplift_rules#Guidelines_on_approval_comments> has some more context on that. Once that's done the process is pretty automatic from there. Gijs can help with the overall process as needed.

propagate referrer policy throughout the ui
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
1113431 (primary 3 patches)
1133577 (likely needed for the above to apply)
1144816 (focus patch fixes race condition in the test)
I'd also disable referrer tests on e10s - they're flaky on several platforms, for several different reasons (unrelated to these patches, AFAICT).
[User impact if declined]:
Meta referrer will get delayed yet again:
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/0elnyR7jZe8>
This feature enables several privacy & security improvements. Facebook, Yahoo, and Google want this, and have been using a similar feature in Chrome & Safari for years. For Google Scholar specifically (I cannot speak for others), lack of meta referrer support stops me from moving Firefox to HTTPS / HSTS, which has obvious privacy and security implications.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
Primary bug includes an integration test. TreeHerder has been happy for several days, except on e10s - see [bug 1144816](/show_bug.cgi?id=1144816 "NEW - Intermittent browser_referrer_open_link_in_tab.js | Test timed out") and [bug 1145199](/show_bug.cgi?id=1145199 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent browser_referrer_open_link_in_private.js,browser_referrer_open_link_in_window.js | Test timed out"), both of which are test flakiness on e10s only, not bugs in the feature AFAICT.
[Risks and why]:
Medium - there's a fair amount of code, but it's all straightforward parameter propagation, and it's well covered by the automatic tests. The underlying meta referrer implementation had been on MC and Aurora / Beta since last fall. This set of patches merely propagates the referrer policy in a few more places in the UI.
These changes obviously touch click and context menu handling code in the UI. But if I broke \_that\_ completely, these patches would be backed out by now. :-)
The real risk here is the privacy / security risk of propagating overly detailed referrer headers due to unknown implementation deficiencies. I'm not aware of any logic errors in this set of patches, but, of course, I'm merely human.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
One of the patches changes UUID for nsIWebNavigation, and renames one of the methods in it. I updated all the calls on MC, and it was not in use by any of the addons.
Per [comment 74](/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431#c74 "RESOLVED FIXED - <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click"), this breaks source compatibility with one of the addons, due to the addon's use of a private function in browser.js. The author had been copied on the bug for some time. No UUID change is involved.Flags: needinfo?(averstak)

Aurora patch 9 of 9. Skip flaky e10s tests on win & mac due to [bug 1145199](/show_bug.cgi?id=1145199 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent browser_referrer_open_link_in_private.js,browser_referrer_open_link_in_window.js | Test timed out") and [bug 1144816](/show_bug.cgi?id=1144816 "NEW - Intermittent browser_referrer_open_link_in_tab.js | Test timed out"). The mac one could well be fixed by part 8, but we don't know this yet. The win one is still open. Both are e10s races unrelated to meta-referrer code, hence silencing them on Aurora.

This should do it for Aurora, though it obviously needs a try run (I don't have committer access to submit one). Part 9 should be reviewed - flagging Gijs, though it's quite trivial. All else is patches from MC with at worst a simple rebase.

Dougall Johnson discovered an out of bounds read and write in asm.js. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information,

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-2712](/security/CVE-2015-2712))

Scott Bell discovered a use-afer-free during the processing of text when

vertical text is enabled. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-2713](/security/CVE-2015-2713))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during

shutdown. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-2715](/security/CVE-2015-2715))

Ucha Gobejishvili discovered a buffer overflow when parsing compressed XML

content. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-2716](/security/CVE-2015-2716))

A buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read were discovered when parsing

metadata in MP4 files in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2015-2717](/security/CVE-2015-2717))

Mark Hammond discovered that when a trusted page is hosted within an

iframe in an untrusted page, the untrusted page can intercept webchannel

responses meant for the trusted page in some circumstances. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

exploit this to bypass origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-2718](/security/CVE-2015-2718))

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-49

## Referrer policy ignored when links opened by middle-click and context menu

Announced
May 12, 2015
Reporter
Alex Verstak
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 38
* SeaMonkey 2.35

### Description

Security researcher **Alex Verstak** reported that <meta
name="referrer"> is ignored when a link is opened through the
context menu or a middle-click by mouse. This means that, in some situations,
the referrer policy is ignored when opening links in new tabs and may cause
some pages to open without an HTTP Referer header being set according to
the author's intended policy.

### References

* [<meta name="referrer"> is ignored for navigations from the context
  menu and via a middle-click](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1113431)
