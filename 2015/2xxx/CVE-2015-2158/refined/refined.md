Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the `pngcrush_measure_idat()` function within `pngcrush.c`.
*   Specifically, the issue stems from a loop that initializes a buffer named `buff`. When the variable `length` is 0, the loop counter `ib` will eventually reach -1, leading to an out-of-bounds write (`buff[ib] = 0;`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Off-by-one error:** The core issue is a classic off-by-one error in the loop logic. This causes writing before the beginning of the `buff` buffer.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The negative index leads to writing memory outside of the intended buffer allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The immediate impact is an application crash due to a write access violation. This is the most likely consequence according to the analysis.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** Although the primary impact is a crash, the initial report suggests that the vulnerability is potentially exploitable for code execution. The initial crash is caused by an access violation at a location matching the destination operand which may indicate that the attacker may control the write address and/or value.
*   It is stated that this issue did not affect the version of pngcrush shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted PNG file with specific characteristics that result in `length` being 0 in the vulnerable code section.
*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PNG file to the vulnerable application (pngcrush).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed PNG image to the vulnerable application `pngcrush`.
*   No special user privileges are mentioned, the vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed image file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.7.83 of `pngcrush`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.84 of `pngcrush`.
*   The fix was not mentioned in the release notes.
*   The issue was classified as "CLOSED NOTABUG" in Red Hat Bugzilla.
*   The bug report mentions tracking bugs for Fedora and EPEL.
