Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2969

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the `oekakis` parameter in the `index.php` file of Simple Oekaki BBS. This leads to a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-79:**  Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `oekakis` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The injected script is stored and executed when other users view the content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browsers of users who view the affected page. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Other malicious activities, depending on the script injected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable via network access.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the vulnerable `oekakis` parameter with the malicious script.
*   When a user accesses the affected page containing the injected script, the script is executed within the user's browser, leading to the vulnerability being exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed for successful exploitation.

**Affected Product:**
*   LEMON-S PHP Simple Oekaki BBS versions prior to v1.21.

**Solution:**
*   Update to the latest version of the software.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS v2 base score of 5.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Shoji Baba to IPA, and JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer.
