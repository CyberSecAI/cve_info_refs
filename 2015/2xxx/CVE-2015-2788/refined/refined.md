Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2788

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` to format error messages into fixed-size buffers within the `ib_fill_isqlda` function in `dbdimp.c`. Specifically, two instances were identified where the output of `sprintf` could exceed the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `err` buffers are allocated on the stack and are of fixed size. When the formatted error message exceeds this size, a stack buffer overflow occurs.
*   **Use of `sprintf`:** `sprintf` does not perform bounds checking, making it prone to buffer overflows when the input is untrusted or unpredictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unspecified impact:** The CVE description states "unspecified impact", which means that the consequences of a successful exploit are unknown. However, stack-based buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote attackers:** The vulnerability can be triggered by remote attackers through unspecified vectors related to binding octets to columns within the Firebird RDBMS.
*   **Error condition:** The vulnerability is triggered when specific error conditions occur related to data binding during database interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Firebird RDBMS server using the vulnerable DBD-Firebird driver.
*   The attacker needs to manipulate data binding operations in such a way that it generates a specific error condition that triggers the overflow in `ib_fill_isqlda`.

**Technical Details:**

The specific vulnerable code snippets are:

```c
    char err[80];
    sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_VARYING): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu",
            (long unsigned)len, (long unsigned)(sizeof(char) * (ivar->sqllen)));
```

and

```c
   char err[80];
    sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_TEXT): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu",
            (long unsigned)len, (long unsigned)(sizeof(char) * (ivar->sqllen)));
```
These two locations are vulnerable because the length of the formatted string can exceed the buffer's size of 80 bytes, particularly if `len` and `ivar->sqllen` are large.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is mitigated by:
*   Replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf`, which takes a size argument and prevents buffer overflows.
*   Increasing the buffer size to `ERRBUFSIZE = 255`, which provides additional safety margin.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVE assignment specifically excludes other buffer overflows fixed by Damyan Ivanov.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in DBD-Firebird version 1.19.
*   Debian provided updates for the affected versions in the Wheezy, Jessie and unstable (Sid) distributions.
