Aug 18 2000

July 29 2000
* AutoCommit attribute handling:

- in dbd_login6():
simply turns on imp_dbh->init_commit = 1

- in db_STORE_attrib() :
if init_commit == 1:
if AutoCommit turned On: do nothing.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in
imp_dbh->tr

if init_commit == 0:
if AutoCommit turned On: commit changes.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in
imp_dbh->tr

Before returning, init_commit is reset to 0.

Package        : libdbd-firebird-perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2788
Debian Bug     : 780925

Stefan Roas discovered a way to cause a buffer overflow in DBD-FireBird,
a Perl DBI driver for the Firebird RDBMS, in certain error conditions, due
to the use of the sprintf() function to write to a fixed-size memory buffer.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91-2+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.18-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-firebird-perl packages.

Hi there,

I found a buffer overflow in dbdimp.c. Error messages in dbdimp.c use
sprintf to a fix-sized buffer that (quite likely in two cases) might be
too small to hold the final result.

Attached you find a patch that solves the problem by increasing the size
of the buffer to a value that should be large enough for every
conceivable input given the conversion specification and additionally
use snprintf() instead of sprintf(). As snprintf() is already used
somewhere else in dbdimp.c I figure there are no portability issues
involved.

I did not check the other uses of sprintf, although it might be
worthwhile to do so as a quick check found other locations where a
fix-sized buffer is involved.

Best regards,
  Stefan

I have committed the patch in packaging Git¹. I have also committed
another patch that replaces all sprintf() usage with snprintf(). Both
patches were applied and released upstream (by me).

¹ <https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-perl/packages/libdbd-firebird-perl.git/log/>

To avoid some mistake doe to too much self-confidence, I'd appreciate
if others could take a look and state their opinion on whether this is
suitable for jessie (and perhaps wheezy).

TIA,
    dam

Presumably this means there were three cases found by Stefan Roas but
the third wasn't exploitable. CVE-2015-2788 is for:

  - char err[80];
  - sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_VARYING): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu"

  - char err[80];
  - sprintf(err, "String truncation (SQL_TEXT): attempted to bind %lu octets to column sized %lu"

For the third one:

  - char err[80];
  - sprintf(err, "You have not provided a value for non-nullable parameter #%d.", i);

"You have not provided a value for non-nullable
parameter #-9223372036854775807.\0" is 80 characters.

Also, the scope of this CVE ID does not include any unreported or
later-reported buffer overflows found and fixed by Damyan Ivanov,
e.g., ones in the
