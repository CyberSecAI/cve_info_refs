  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory.",
    "weaknesses": [

    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then, for example, take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email attack scenario: An attacker could send a specially crafted file to the user and convince the user to open the file.",
      "Web-based attack scenario: An attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have to convince users to click a link and then convince them to open the specially crafted file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software. The attacker has to get the user to either open the file sent via email or visit a compromised website."
