Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises due to how Microsoft Excel handles memory release, specifically an unintended manner. This improper memory handling allows an attacker to potentially bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a security feature bypass that allows an attacker to circumvent ASLR. While this doesn't directly enable code execution, it weakens a critical security defense.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass ASLR:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass ASLR.
- **Remote Code Execution:** When combined with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, the ASLR bypass could facilitate arbitrary code execution. The ASLR bypass is not sufficient for RCE by itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Excel (.xls) file to a user, convincing them to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** A malicious website can host a file or compromised websites could host user-provided content designed to exploit the vulnerability, requiring the victim to visit the website and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver a specially crafted Excel (.xls) file.
- The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document clarifies that the ASLR bypass vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution by itself.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how memory information is disclosed.
- Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure and had no information of public exploitation at the time of the security bulletin was issued.

The content provides more detail than the CVE description, specifically on the attack vectors and the fact that this vulnerability needs to be chained with other vulnerabilities for RCE.
