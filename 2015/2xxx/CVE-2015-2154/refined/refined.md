{
  "CVE-2015-2154": {
    "Description": "The osi_print_cksum function in print-isoclns.c in the ethernet printer in tcpdump before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via a crafted (1) length, (2) offset, or (3) base pointer checksum value.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing sanity checks in the osi_print_cksum() function in print-isoclns.c. The function may call the create_osi_cksum() function in checksum.c with invalid data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Missing sanity checks"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted network traffic",
      "Crafted PPP packets"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker able to send crafted network traffic or PPP packets."
  }
