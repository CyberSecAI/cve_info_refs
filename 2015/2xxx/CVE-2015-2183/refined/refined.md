Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2183:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The content directly relates to CVE-2015-2183.  It is clearly stated that "Use CVE-2015-2183 for all of the SQL injection issues in your report."

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Zeuscart v.4 application, specifically in the administrative backend. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the administrative backend of Zeuscart v.4. These vulnerabilities are located in the following parameters:
        - `id` parameter within `admin/?do=disporders&action=detail`
        - `cid` parameter within `admin/?do=editcurrency`
        - `id` parameter within `admin/?do=subadminmgt&action=edit`

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - By exploiting these SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker could:
        -  Extract sensitive data from the database.
        - Modify or delete data within the database.
        - Potentially gain full control of the database server.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable admin pages of the Zeuscart application.
    - The attacker crafts malicious SQL statements and appends it to the vulnerable parameters (`id` and `cid`) in the URL.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   -  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Zeuscart application.
   -  The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerabilities are present in the admin interface.
   -  Basic knowledge of SQL syntax and how to construct SQL injection attacks is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes specific exploit examples:

*   **SQL Injection Examples**
    *   `http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=disporders&action=detail&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,database%28%29,34,35,version%28%29,37,38+--+`
    *   `http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=editcurrency&cid=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,version%28%29,5+--+`
    *   `http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=subadminmgt&action=edit&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,database%28%29,5+--+`

These examples use `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from the database, including the database name and version.
