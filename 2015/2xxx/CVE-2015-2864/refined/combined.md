## CERT Vulnerability CVE-2015-2864

Resources

---

---

title: CERT Vulnerability CVE-2015-2864
created\_at: 2015.06.15
updated\_at: 2015.06.15
category: Resources
platforms: Windows, Mac
---

[CVE-2015-2864](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/101500) affects all environments with password-protected clients, including Retrospect 8 for Mac and Retrospect 7 for Windows. Retrospect has included a security update to address this issue in the following versions:

* Retrospect 10.0.2 for Windows
* Retrospect Client 10.0.2 for Windows
* Retrospect 12.0.2 for Mac
* Retrospect Client 12.0.2 for Mac
* Retrospect Client 10.0.2 for Linux

We strongly advise customers to address this issue if it affects their environments:

**Customers using clients with public/private keypairs** — This issue does not affect environments using public/private keypairs where the client has never had a password set up. If the client has used a password, see steps below to remove it.

**Customers using clients with password protection** — This issue is a security risk for your environment. There are two ways to address it:

* [Updating to the latest versions of Retrospect](#updating)
* [Switching to keypairs within your current environment](#keypairs)

See [Technical Details](#details) for more information.

### Updating to the latest versions of Retrospect

The latest versions of Retrospect are available from [Downloads](/en/support/downloads). These include a security update to address the CERT vulnerability.

1. Download the latest version of Retrospect and update the Retrospect Engine and all Retrospect Clients.
2. Update each client’s password. See [Retrospect for Mac documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/mac/hardware#using-the-sources-toolbar) and [Retrospect for Windows documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/win/networked_clients#update-client-password) for specific steps. This can be the same password that they already have. This process is necessary to remove the security issue, by replacing the affected password hash with a new unaffected one.

### Switching to keypairs within your current environment

Public/private keypairs allow Retrospect Client to automatically authenticate with the Retrospect Engine without the need for a password. Switching to public/private keypairs ensures your clients are not exposed to this risk, and you can set them up without upgrading to the latest version of Retrospect. Our User’s Guide walks through how to set these up.

#### Retrospect for Windows

1. See [Retrospect for Windows documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/win/management#clients-preferences) for instructions on creating public/private keypairs from Preferences.

   ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.retrospect.com/docs/win/v8.0/user_guide/img/en/win_rug-388.jpg)
2. Add the public key to each client. See [documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/win/networked_clients#installing-clients) for re-installation instructions.
3. In Clients, remove the client and re-add it again to start using the public/private keypair. You will need to re-add the clients to their respective scripts.
4. You can verify the authentication method by looking at Clients > Properties > Tools. It should list "Security: uses private/public key".

*Retrospect Desktop for Windows* — Public/private keypairs are not officially supported in the Desktop edition of Retrospect for Windows. However, you can take steps to use them in your current environment. Please contact [Support](/en/support/phone) for more information.

#### Retrospect for Mac

1. Create a public/private keypair. See [documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/mac/management#clients-preferences) for instructions for doing so in Preferences.

   ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.retrospect.com/site/docs/ug/mac/preferences_clients.en.png)
2. Add the public key to each client. See [documentation](/en/documentation/user_guide/mac/getting_started#installing-clients) for re-installation instructions.
3. In Sources, remove the client and then re-add it again to start using the public/private keypair. You will need to re-add the clients to their respective scripts.
4. You can verify the authentication method by looking at Sources > Summary. It should list "Security: Public/Private Key".

### Public key locations in Retrospect Clients

* **Windows XP** — Place the public key at `C:\Program Files\Retrospect\Retrospect Client\pubkey.dat`.
* **Windows Vista, 7, 8** — Place the public key at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Retrospect\Retrospect Client\pubkey.dat`.
* **Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.10 (prior to v12.0.2)** — Place the public key at

  `/Library/PreferencePanes/Retrospect Client.prefPane/Contents/SharedSupport/pubkey.dat`.
* **Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.10 (12.0.2)** — Place the public key at `/Library/Preferences/pubkey.dat`.
* **Linux** — Linux client releases prior to 10.0.2 do not support public/private keypairs. Please contact <a href="/en/support/phone">Support</a> if you are running a Linux client prior to 10.0.2.

### Technical Details

Retrospect Client does not store the password you type in. Instead, it stores a computational hash of it and uses that hash to authenticate with the Retrospect Engine. The hash is generated by an algorithm designed to prevent others from being able to guess the original password or pick a different password that generates the same hash. However, a bug in the algorithm significantly increases the likelihood of a different password matching the original password’s hash. A sophisticated individual with a significant amount of technical expertise and network access to this Retrospect Client could use this bug to gain access to the Retrospect Client and the computer it runs on from a different Retrospect Engine.

[00:00] and we are going to talk about fasting
[00:02] reversing unmask this is our agenda and
[00:07] the topics that we are going to talk
[00:08] about during this presentation so first
[00:13] of all who we are as i was in my name is
[00:16] Giuseppe I'm amp attention test and
[00:18] security researcher at the light on
[00:20] google or offensive security i'm also a
[00:23] / geek of course and you have my blog
[00:26] twitter account an email account if we
[00:28] want to contact me hello my name is
[00:31] pedro impetus intestines equity results
[00:33] and Telefonica address is a greedy since
[00:36] i was young and this is our blog my
[00:39] email you want to contact me okay what
[00:44] this talk is about this talk is about
[00:46] our research team backup servers and
[00:50] white backup servers well because we
[00:53] think they are critical for company's
[00:55] backup servers and backup clients
[00:57] because if you hack or compromise our
[00:59] backup server or several back up Cline's
[01:02] you could compromise her an entire
[01:04] company also because they are sold as a
[01:06] security software so they should be
[01:09] secure right but as you probably know
[01:11] and as you would see during this
[01:13] presentation they are not secure at all
[01:15] then we start to use this backup server
[01:18] list in Wikipedia as you can see on the
[01:20] right where we can find a lot of
[01:22] different backup products from different
[01:25] vendors and we found several
[01:29] vulnerabilities in a lot of backup
[01:30] applications here where we are going to
[01:33] talk about the retrospective l'occasion
[01:35] the nose of handy backup but of course
[01:37] we found a lot of issues in other
[01:41] products but we won't talk about them
[01:42] because we don't have enough time and
[01:44] because of legal issues as well but the
[01:47] important thing here is that using these
[01:49] techniques that we are going to talk
[01:50] about here you will find vulnerabilities
[01:53] in a lot of pocket products and this is
[01:55] for sure ok so let's start the SEO Dae
[01:59] party there are no fixes for these
[02:01] vanities that's why because vendors
[02:04] didn't try to contact us so it's the
[02:05] same we want to show you how we have we
[02:09] found this kind of issues step by step
[02:11] and then you will fine
[02:13] more in other products for sure on the
[02:15] bucket products at least we know that
[02:19] all of you are good people I won't use
[02:20] these issues with evil intent and of
[02:23] course we won't be responsible with your
[02:25] evil IPS ok the first of what I want to
[02:28] talk about this done just backup server
[02:30] is have a coupla and serve a while I use
[02:33] in my NASA as you can see in so much
[02:35] bait we have two told that NC tall one
[02:40] months ago that retrospect was so in
[02:42] 2012 as you can see in the copyright in
[02:48] the passion one found some varieties
[02:50] memory corruption and stuff but no my
[02:53] buddies were report since 2008 so this
[02:56] is the report any molarity so I'm going
[02:59] to see one opinion is so much time our
[03:02] first step in the result will be the
[03:05] type of the request and respond using
[03:06] canopy but what is gonna be okay is
[03:09] amazing tool is you can see that they
[03:13] were suffice software and canopy we can
[03:15] intercept and play with almost anything
[03:17] in the screen so off on the left you can
[03:19] see their price if I software I'm on the
[03:21] right you can see the cannibal Oh Millie
[03:25] you have to server and a client to the
[03:27] spadix is the server to the client this
[03:29] is the client and in the clay
[03:31] installation you have to set the
[03:32] password and with the server tries to
[03:34] connect to a new client is so this
[03:36] message box okay and this is the screen
[03:40] that cannot be sauce okay so we know
[03:45] that the clients have to send to the
[03:46] password to a server why because if you
[03:49] enter in my password in the message box
[03:51] at the server it won't send any pocket
[03:53] so the several now has the password it's
[03:55] a guinea by itself but when declines in
[03:58] the password okay you look this k for
[04:00] this screenshot when when the client
[04:03] right through to the server ok try to
[04:05] add it's also contains the tie-in
[04:08] hostname fiscally stable and the client
[04:11] version will display a dot 50 and stuff
[04:14] is this another another back
[04:17] that decline sent to a server a little
[04:22] later the password is he in this
[04:23] encrypted packet inside it inspecting we
[04:26] canopy we realize that this bites da and
[04:30] da okay this stuff are likely put the
[04:34] cord cutters so we are going to sue and
[04:35] put the controversy in order to
[04:37] understand how this works okay in this
[04:42] case we use break points in the rock vs
[04:44] and V fans eons and then go further in
[04:46] the debuggers a typical way to the
[04:48] protocol person as you can see here in
[04:51] the the left we have the encrypted
[04:54] packet in the canopy log and here we
[04:57] have in the debugger when the function
[04:59] Ricky is called and then if we look at
[05:01] the buffer we will be able to see the
[05:04] encrypted packet in the memory dump as
[05:06] you can see here ok and you have their
[05:09] protocol headers and a tank little
[05:11] packet so as I was saying using how our
[05:15] bread points we can find the functions
[05:17] which handle the socket we are looking
[05:18] at for example in the create a packet
[05:22] here in the first bite if we set a
[05:24] harbor bread point in the a a pied when
[05:27] any instruction will try to read or
[05:30] write in this bite we the debugger will
[05:32] stop and we will be able to see what is
[05:34] going on and doing this we found this
[05:37] interesting function with the creeps
[05:39] then create a packet clean some actual
[05:42] operations and here you have the
[05:47] depleted packet ok in the memory de so
[05:51] our main goal here right now it's
[05:54] where's the password in this decrypted
[05:56] packet now as you can see here we were
[05:58] doing several tests with a password test
[06:01] and the password test one and we
[06:03] realized that it's a password house okay
[06:06] so four bytes password password house so
[06:10] if we are able to decrypt this packet
[06:12] using an exploit and get the Hat we will
[06:14] have venality it won't be a really big
[06:18] vulnerability yet but at this it's a
[06:21] good way to start so we need some time
[06:24] to think and reverse the whole process
[06:25] here and then we found three important
[06:27] functions here and
[06:29] that took about these functions now our
[06:32] main goal here is how is the has packet
[06:35] decrypted because we want to write an
[06:36] exploit in order to get the house of any
[06:39] client in this software then we found
[06:42] this function the function one and you
[06:45] seen some logical operations such as a
[06:47] thief left seafreight and or and so on
[06:51] it will calculate four bytes using as a
[06:54] parameter the following 32 bytes key
[06:56] this is the 32 bytes key and this key is
[07:01] the client version plus the client
[07:03] hostname plus a static key remember that
[07:06] the client version decline hostname we
[07:07] we got this information from the client
[07:09] and the static key we found it in the
[07:12] debugger as a as a constant as you can
[07:15] hear as you can see here is a 32 bytes
[07:18] constant constant and it's always the
[07:20] same the original function the function
[07:22] to as you can see here the call it has
[07:25] several loops and it with the four bytes
[07:28] from functioning as an argument it will
[07:30] generate a one sunset and twenty four
[07:32] byte array as you can see here in the in
[07:35] the memory dump then there is another
[07:37] function the function three and with the
[07:40] last arrived from France intuition
[07:42] argument it will create another array of
[07:45] 1034 byte array bring some extra
[07:48] operations between the last arrived from
[07:50] France into and the circuit key remember
[07:52] the key was the client version plus the
[07:54] client hostname plaid plus staticky then
[07:58] the function one it will be called again
[08:00] and doing the same logical operations
[08:03] and using an argument the last array
[08:05] from functional three it will generate
[08:06] another four bytes then the function to
[08:09] it would be called again and with the
[08:11] last four bytes from transferring one it
[08:13] will generate another array and finally
[08:16] the function three doing sonic
[08:19] separations between the last every from
[08:22] france in two and then created packet it
[08:24] will decreed the packet okay so as to
[08:27] marry here we have this graph it's
[08:29] pretty simple we have three functions
[08:32] and they will be called twice and the
[08:36] only a very important thing that we
[08:38] really need here for our exploit is the
[08:41] shaky
[08:42] ok so Sumari every I go magnin's 5savg
[08:45] static I said the key remember has the
[08:48] keys composed with a client version
[08:50] please and the client first name and i
[08:52] set the key that we found in the
[08:54] debugger so we have everything we can
[08:56] write explainer we all right to try ask
[09:01] at ryans planar to get the first
[09:03] password for any client so is not we
[09:05] just need to secure the fancy one two
[09:07] and three and use the aesthetic
[09:08] parameters ok how it works look at that
[09:11] this is the first packet that we have to
[09:14] send and then the client respond with
[09:15] the client hosting and the client base
[09:18] after that we have to send this another
[09:20] pin bucket and is a response with this
[09:22] packet that contained the house so we
[09:26] are going to put all the things together
[09:27] in a pythoness plate this is the a
[09:30] Python code it's a representation of the
[09:32] assembly code in Python is advancing one
[09:35] this is function to it's another Python
[09:38] representation of the assembly code of
[09:40] the function to of course and this is
[09:43] define the function three okay this is
[09:44] another Python code of assembly code
[09:47] first of all we have to solve some
[09:49] requirements we don't need my in the
[09:51] middle we just need to send a packet to
[09:53] to the client then we have the same
[09:56] another packet secure the fans young and
[09:59] finally we has of analyte we are going
[10:02] to see in a limo
[10:11] ok this is the code
[10:25] this is a software that respect and
[10:28] we're going to secure the displayed okay
[10:33] and this is the key and this is the
[10:37] encrypted packet and this is the four
[10:39] bytes that the function one would create
[10:46] I'll go a bit faster okay this is the
[10:54] first pocket and then give us decline
[10:58] hosting a clean version after that this
[11:00] another pin pocket give us the pocket
[11:05] account in the house and finally our
[11:09] script have to go okay this is the
[11:13] decrypted packet inside you can get this
[11:18] house okay in this case this is the
[11:19] house
[11:28] so now we have the ability to get the
[11:31] house of any client okay but what can we
[11:34] do with this house as you can see here
[11:37] we have the house of the password test
[11:38] and the path of the password test one
[11:40] it's always for base has it changed at
[11:44] all as you can see here so it's a four
[11:46] bytes house so we have four billion of
[11:48] possible unique passwords and the
[11:51] maximum of the British retrospect
[11:54] password application is 31 cutters and
[11:56] we can use more or less and IT possible
[11:59] characters in this password so this is
[12:02] the number of the possible passwords in
[12:03] the application which is really big and
[12:06] take back on this number and the four
[12:09] pies has the collision number is this
[12:11] one which is really really big as well
[12:13] it's even more than atoms on earth so
[12:15] it's really big and as you project will
[12:18] be thinking right now yes this is a an
[12:20] easy or vulnerability but of course we
[12:23] will try to go further in this then we
[12:27] found the hash function which is a
[12:29] function one we know more or less some
[12:31] details have a dysfunction but will try
[12:33] to explain more details of this function
[12:36] during the following slides this
[12:40] function will take a segment the clear
[12:42] text password which is in this case is
[12:44] test okay and it will do some logical
[12:48] operations such as if left seafreight
[12:50] and/or then it will multiply it will do
[12:55] a multiplication of the Carter of the
[12:57] password by itself and then it will do
[12:59] an annex or operation and when the
[13:03] function is executed it will generate
[13:05] the house of the password as you can see
[13:07] here in the es register so with this how
[13:12] can we find a vulnerability here and how
[13:15] can we exploit this well in order to do
[13:18] that we need to use some mass you have
[13:23] to find someone in C code which is
[13:24] easier for us to understand and we have
[13:26] to look carefully at line 5 and at 97 in
[13:29] line f7 we have the acceleration of the
[13:34] multiplication of the Carter of the
[13:36] password by itself we'll talk about the
[13:38] separation later but now we have to
[13:40] focus on line five where we have the sea
[13:43] fleet operation the operation the sea
[13:45] freight operation and the end three
[13:47] operation here the an three operation we
[13:50] think that the developers tried to use
[13:51] this and as a mask in order to protect
[13:54] the Beast during the rotation but as you
[13:57] probably know three in binary is 011 and
[13:59] any an operation with zero in the result
[14:01] you will have a 0 and that's why this is
[14:03] a failure because if you want to protect
[14:05] all the beach during the rotation in
[14:07] this particular case they must should be
[14:09] seven because seven is 111 there is no
[14:11] zero and you will have even the result
[14:14] you have this other graph where we have
[14:18] the 32 bits of the hash or the 32 bits
[14:23] of the result variable in this Cove
[14:26] before the rotation and because of the
[14:31] how the bit rotation works and the most
[14:35] important thing because of the and three
[14:36] remember the sheraton in the first
[14:41] iteration of the loop the bit too will
[14:45] be erased okay and then the bid five and
[14:49] then the bit 11 and so on and that's why
[14:53] we can build a password which serves the
[14:56] same has in a easy way okay you have
[15:00] this graph this graph we are going to
[15:03] use this graph in order to exploit and
[15:05] explain how it works you have well and
[15:09] this graph sorry represents how the bits
[15:11] are erased in phantom one you have the
[15:16] 32 bits of the hatch and remember that
[15:19] we have the house we have the lead to
[15:20] get the house of any client so we had to
[15:22] get the house of any client so we have
[15:23] the beats and here we have the very the
[15:26] max length of the password application
[15:28] which is 31 Carter's thousand we will
[15:32] try to generate everyone length password
[15:34] which serves the same house if you
[15:37] remember in function one we have we have
[15:39] this under operation the XR of the
[15:42] multiplication of the character of the
[15:44] password by itself and that's why we
[15:45] will use Carter's two and three four
[15:48] our new password because cottage country
[15:50] in exile seema x themselves will have
[15:53] these binary numbers and we will use the
[15:57] third-lowest bit in this binary numbers
[15:59] let's see how it works for example if we
[16:01] have a zero in this house bit in this
[16:04] particular case if we want to start from
[16:06] the last card of the password the number
[16:08] 30 we'll have to use one of these two
[16:11] binary numbers starting from here from
[16:13] the lowest bid and we'll have in this
[16:15] particular case we'll have to put the
[16:18] same bit in the black square that we
[16:20] have in the second the hash bit so in
[16:22] this case is zero we'll use a cutter 3
[16:24] and now we are selling the hospital in
[16:26] this case in the following cutters will
[16:29] use will use the same logic but also we
[16:32] have to take into account the expiration
[16:34] for example if we have here a 1 in this
[16:37] hash bit we'll have in to put in this
[16:41] black square a bit with which doing an
[16:44] extra operation between this bit and all
[16:46] the bits which are below at the same
[16:48] column the result has to be the same as
[16:50] this one for example here if we put a 0
[16:53] xer between 0 and 1 the result will be 1
[16:56] so now here we are serving the hospital
[16:59] well and in the following car test will
[17:02] use the same logic thinking doc on the
[17:04] expression of this bitten all the bits
[17:07] which are beyond the same column and
[17:08] again and again and in the last case for
[17:11] character 0 will use a another new logic
[17:15] because we have to fix or put two bits
[17:18] and that's why because if you remember
[17:20] we have 32 has beads and 31 characters
[17:23] in the password so because of that
[17:25] difference that's why we go we have to
[17:27] put two bits and also will use cutters
[17:32] in this case 2 3 4 & 6 because using
[17:35] those cards we will have all the
[17:37] possible combinations in the binary
[17:38] numbers for example if we have a 1 and a
[17:42] 0 here we'll have to start from here
[17:44] from the lowest bit like always and
[17:47] we'll have to put in the black square a
[17:49] bit with doing an acceleration between
[17:52] this bit and all the bits which are
[17:53] below at the same column as you can see
[17:56] here in this red line the result has to
[17:59] be the same as this one and here the
[18:01] same
[18:01] I'm putting all this logic together in
[18:04] an algorithm we will be able to build a
[18:07] password which serves the same has in ic
[18:09] way this is a the code it's pretty
[18:13] simple we are using cottage two and
[18:15] three and Carter six two three and four
[18:19] for the last case the character 0 but
[18:22] the best way to show you how it works is
[18:24] a demonstration video but first of all
[18:27] like office requirements we don't need
[18:29] my memory as you know we just need the
[18:33] Hat which we got from exploit one we
[18:35] will build a password which sells the
[18:37] same house and we will use their
[18:39] retrospect server the trial version
[18:41] which is free and try to access to the
[18:43] client let's see how it works
[18:57] okay here we have the server we are
[19:01] adding the client in the IP 69 and the
[19:06] client is asking for the password this
[19:08] is the traffic between the client and
[19:09] the server and now just as a proof we'll
[19:14] use the password test which is the
[19:17] actual password of the client just as a
[19:19] proof copy will paste it here click OK
[19:26] and you have the traffic between the
[19:29] client and the server as you can see
[19:31] there are a lot of encrypted packets
[19:32] will talk about this encrypted packets
[19:34] later and here we have the control panel
[19:38] of the client we can click at tools and
[19:40] everything is working that's ok now we
[19:44] will delete the client and we will add
[19:46] it again the same IP address IP 69 again
[19:52] the decline is asking for the password
[19:54] and now we'll use our exploit will use
[20:00] this function in order to calculate the
[20:03] house of the password test just as a
[20:06] proof but remember that we have the
[20:07] ability to get the house of any client
[20:09] and we will pass the house to this
[20:13] binary and the binary will give us a
[20:15] password a 31 lengths password which
[20:18] serves the same house as you can see
[20:21] here ok we copy q
[20:31] so prove you have the password placed it
[20:37] here okay now here we have the control
[20:43] panel decline but if we look carefully
[20:46] at the canopy log we can see that the
[20:48] server is trying to send an encrypted
[20:50] packet to the client and the client is
[20:52] not responding so something is not going
[20:54] well here and if we click at tools in
[20:58] the control panel of the client we will
[21:00] have this network error so definitely
[21:03] something is not going well here to see
[21:07] why ok so the spec this year the pliant
[21:12] a use an acquittal protocol between them
[21:14] this is a request response because
[21:17] response so we start to think that in
[21:19] greece IAM is using the plane the plane
[21:21] test password is the key as a few toes
[21:25] application you contain a password of
[21:26] the client ok doing some tests we
[21:30] realize that the client has to send all
[21:33] information to the server in order that
[21:35] the server has to know the password you
[21:38] see in several tests finally this to
[21:42] passwords ok this is a possible that we
[21:45] built has the same house as you can see
[21:48] in these screens but has this for whites
[21:51] are completely dif so we know that
[21:56] installation of the client we have to
[21:57] set the password so we're going to check
[22:00] with even linux client and do an
[22:02] installation and first of all we have to
[22:03] simply the main function and we realize
[22:06] how we see this francium subset firat as
[22:09] password that could be interesting
[22:11] because this we call the first time that
[22:13] we going to change the password and
[22:15] following this fancy would realize that
[22:18] will be called a dysfunction rick has
[22:21] block reset key and key to and click so
[22:24] we are going to see how what is this
[22:27] fancy ok we have locks is the function
[22:30] one remember find someone with a and
[22:32] three operation and civ right and so on
[22:35] the cassette ki will realize that it
[22:38] defines ian to with many loops and the
[22:40] could increase the function three
[22:42] with extra operation the array and so on
[22:45] so it's related negated packet are
[22:47] generated somehow with the plane
[22:49] dispatch board you've seen our frame of
[22:51] fans even one two and three so we need
[22:53] to find how this money by are generated
[22:55] we make a test okay a test with the pub
[22:59] war test we are going to see with
[23:02] yourself how how this for money buys
[23:04] we've been ready to using my diploma and
[23:06] g DB server sorry okay you have the idea
[23:21] pro we are using the debugger fighter
[23:24] bro we have attached the liner's claim
[23:27] and using GD x GD c DB server the lines
[23:30] with respect line on the clients asking
[23:33] for the first equation password and of
[23:36] course we typed a test password and the
[23:40] fancy on one it will be called and you
[23:43] seen as an argument as you can see here
[23:45] in the clear text password in the memory
[23:47] dump then when it's acute it you will
[23:52] generate the house of the password this
[23:53] is no need for us and then the fancy
[23:56] onto it will be security and using as an
[23:59] argument the house of the password as
[24:01] you can see here in the memory dump
[24:05] again this is not new for us it will
[24:08] generate the 1024 by the array and then
[24:15] the Phantom 3 which is called creep do
[24:23] in Crete
[24:26] using us an argument the last array from
[24:30] France into of fans into and the clear
[24:34] text password and this is new for us
[24:37] okay and it's important we'll see why it
[24:40] will generate another 1024 x tell ray
[24:46] and finally the function 3 which is
[24:51] defined someone again sorry the crib has
[24:53] block it will be it would be executed
[24:58] using a Cybermen the last arrived from
[25:00] francium 3 and when you cease acute it
[25:06] it will generate this interesting 4matic
[25:09] by say one a dd5 744 so the format the
[25:19] bites are generated with the house and
[25:21] the plaintext password we have the house
[25:23] but we don't have the plaintext password
[25:25] remember that we have the ability to get
[25:28] the hassle in decline and we have the
[25:29] ability to build password passwords
[25:31] which serves as him has but we don't
[25:32] have the plaintext password the real the
[25:35] actual password of the client so at this
[25:37] point we thought that it was pretty
[25:39] difficult to get something good here but
[25:40] let's do some math again just in case ok
[25:45] maths and the for Malika password
[25:49] generated from the password and it has
[25:50] this is the graph somehow Hollywood
[25:54] makeup eyes will begin writing important
[25:56] mystery has the Rho will be created is
[25:59] using the password in clear test and
[26:01] there i won and everyone is work-related
[26:04] using the house and the house is known
[26:06] to us for airai one is known to us she's
[26:09] a static is a static value for us
[26:12] password we are tests all we saw with
[26:14] 1024 bytes array using this formula this
[26:17] formula is the formula have to use in
[26:19] order to create a Rho function my race
[26:22] wrote this as you know as a consequence
[26:24] of this initial important a 32 bytes of
[26:27] the array one but y el aceite y so that
[26:30] i won
[26:31] okay you look carefully this graph this
[26:33] will have a represents the way that the
[26:35] pits will be raised the gray area is the
[26:40] area where David's will be raised so
[26:42] it's all important the 982 until 1033
[26:47] attalee this is the earthly delights of
[26:49] the of the right so this bit despite
[26:52] will be using the third line of the
[26:53] formula because he's between I 1024
[26:59] arrival is a static because it's known
[27:02] to us they has okay we only have to take
[27:04] care of this part out formula okay and
[27:06] actually this part is the solar followed
[27:10] all of charge of characters of the
[27:12] password let's go on to see an example
[27:16] ok this is the password test and this is
[27:18] the XML value of the password test if
[27:21] you saw all of the character between
[27:22] them we get this number numbers is thing
[27:24] so the drink will be to get a password
[27:27] which says the same has and also if you
[27:30] saw all of its characters between them
[27:32] we get the same number okay so as we
[27:34] have to solve only printable characters
[27:36] from 22 7f we get 127 numbers cutters so
[27:43] you only have to brute force the 128
[27:46] possibilities this is the password that
[27:50] we are going to create so we only have
[27:53] to pick up okay because if you saw all
[27:55] of the character between them we get 012
[27:57] in this case in the case of tests will
[28:00] you have to take care of this number
[28:02] okay number 16 this is the algorithms
[28:06] that could make it possible it you've
[28:07] recommitted techniques as for you okay
[28:12] again the exploit three departments we
[28:15] don't need again my middle we just need
[28:17] the heart which we got from spoiled one
[28:20] we will be the password which serves the
[28:22] same has and the same format it bites
[28:24] and again we will use their retrospect
[28:26] server the child version let's see how
[28:28] it works
[28:37] ok you have our binary super has binary
[28:41] and will we will give to this binary the
[28:43] house of the password and the binary
[28:46] will give us all the 128 possible
[28:48] passwords now we will have decline again
[28:57] here we are using the password test
[29:01] which is the actual password of a client
[29:03] again as a proof click ok and you have
[29:10] the control point of the client we can
[29:12] click tools it's working that's ok so
[29:16] now add in decline again and now we will
[29:19] use our first password from our exploit
[29:27] you have password copy the password
[29:33] paste here click OK and now here we have
[29:35] the control panel but if we click a
[29:37] tools is not working we have the same
[29:40] network error so this password is
[29:42] sharing the same house but is not
[29:43] sharing the same for magic bytes as you
[29:46] probably could be thinking right now the
[29:47] worst case scenario here is that we have
[29:49] to try with 110 28 possible passwords
[29:51] but don't worry about that because the
[29:55] application won't block you you try with
[29:58] many passwords ok so there is no problem
[30:01] so now well here we know that the valley
[30:05] password in this case is the number 16
[30:13] copy the password just it here so proof
[30:23] now here paste the password click OK and
[30:26] now is it getting its lower screen new
[30:29] for us you have the control panel panel
[30:35] and finally if we click a tools is
[30:37] working and we can do a lot of stuff we
[30:39] can connect to the client we can do any
[30:44] backup task or restore task and we can
[30:47] copy any file of the file system as you
[30:50] can see here we can connect to the hard
[30:52] drive connect and get any file and so on
[30:58] so thank
[31:08] so with this we can have full access to
[31:11] any remote client anyone any sorry we
[31:14] don't need mind emitter or anything us
[31:16] we come back up or restore any file for
[31:19] example story executable sounds good
[31:21] right we can execute any executable
[31:24] after any backup restore task as a
[31:26] future of the application so we can have
[31:28] remote code execution because of this
[31:31] feature and of course we tried with more
[31:33] complex passwords and test we tried with
[31:35] this super secure password as you can
[31:37] see here and this is the house of this
[31:40] password and in this case the valid
[31:43] password will be the first one okay now
[31:47] we are going to talk about the other
[31:48] software other backup software is the
[31:50] novice of handy backup it's a backup
[31:53] client-server widely used by some famous
[31:55] companies such as siemens motorola royal
[31:59] canin of course like dogs and there are
[32:05] no public vulnerable ease in this
[32:06] product at listen during our research so
[32:10] we decided to test it using protocol
[32:12] fashion and then we found a notification
[32:13] bypass and cruise permanent danielle
[32:17] service first will be the affiliation
[32:21] bypass the first step like always will
[32:23] be understanding the communication
[32:25] protocol it's geo the protocol jib and
[32:29] wyshak has de sectors for this protocol
[32:32] so it's a good new for us summary here
[32:37] bisque or vice cumin ova request broker
[32:38] a collector is created by ong in 1981 is
[32:42] a protocol i saw a very mighty Khan RPC
[32:44] and is providing the ready between
[32:46] vendors alamosa so you can call
[32:48] operations in c++ you seen up the
[32:50] developing java it has many elements you
[32:53] can see these gave us we only have to
[32:56] focus in this protocol because it's a
[32:58] protocol that handy backup i use the
[33:03] abused Heather I'm hustling site there's
[33:05] a there's important things there this is
[33:07] the Heather and this is the cipher this
[33:10] LAN has to be the same name that the
[33:13] below that okay below that I
[33:14] the packet we are focusing the
[33:18] dedication because we love to blog
[33:20] authentication we become an application
[33:23] packet and we realized that it was in
[33:25] clear test as you can see in this screen
[33:29] ok the next step will be fast the
[33:32] authentication packet in this case using
[33:34] soo Lee the soo Lee framework you have
[33:37] the sulu template of the application
[33:39] packet you have the authentication
[33:41] plugin and as you can see here we have
[33:45] here once i sir ok but what do we miss
[33:49] here well the do protocol in the
[33:51] software uses several sizes for example
[33:54] in the suffocation packet it uses a
[33:57] sizer for the username for the password
[33:59] and so on and as you can see here we are
[34:02] only using one side once i sir so we
[34:05] made a mistake and we found well the
[34:07] vulnerability i mean if you try to
[34:09] configure all the sizes right you won't
[34:11] find out they have one already as you
[34:13] can see here we were fastened and we
[34:15] were inspecting the requests and
[34:17] responses in the canopy log and the
[34:19] responses from the server were always
[34:21] 60l bites but as you can see here we
[34:24] have this interesting one with 208 bites
[34:26] and if we look at the packet we can see
[34:29] that the username the password are all
[34:31] zeros and we have a balanced session
[34:33] within the backup server it's actually a
[34:38] session of the user number 6 so as you
[34:42] can see here faster are not only for
[34:44] classes you have this pretty
[34:46] self-explanatory example but no one may
[34:50] be hurt bleep you know about this of
[34:53] course ok fine requirements we don't
[34:56] need my in the middle we use a graphic
[34:59] client in order a little so let's play
[35:01] whether you will have to change a
[35:05] application packet by authentication
[35:07] bypass pocket let's see how it works
[35:23] ok this is the dedication my pass pocket
[35:31] this is the house of handy backup ok and
[35:34] we are going to use in can impede a no
[35:37] then you can intercept all the other
[35:40] requests are all the ruckus to the
[35:41] server I want to restart in order to
[35:46] work and we are going to connect today
[35:52] to the server ok this instead all the
[35:59] packets this in this important pocket ok
[36:02] this is the important pocket that
[36:04] contain a dedication so we only have to
[36:08] change it by our dedication bypass
[36:11] packet so copy and paste it hey we click
[36:21] ok ok you have this is the valley
[36:25] session this case you are three we
[36:29] highly disable the little younger to run
[36:32] it as a penny more these kind of packets
[36:33] and we are going to see how this works I
[36:39] have to wait a bit ok here you go you
[36:43] have full access to the way backup
[36:46] server I go a bit faster okay but you
[36:49] can list the sea path and do so many
[36:52] things
[36:58] you
[37:03] okay so you can do many things with this
[37:05] minority you can you have full access to
[37:08] the backup server you can make backups
[37:10] of volatile client restored off a little
[37:12] clients modified binaries it's a good
[37:14] command after tax as a future of the
[37:17] application as you can see in this
[37:18] screenshot and finally we we sell sold
[37:22] it to valuing security as a proof of
[37:25] concept with mace a python exploit in
[37:27] order to list the sea just only a proof
[37:29] because we have to simulate a year
[37:31] communication protocol and passing on
[37:33] the response and it's a bit tedious task
[37:35] so we are going to see a quick
[37:39] demonstration
[37:53] ok this is the proof we went to secure
[38:00] it but first of all we have to show
[38:02] displayed this is all the languages we
[38:10] wrote ok this is that indication my past
[38:16] packet that we have to send first of all
[38:20] or the other requests and responder we
[38:24] have to pass and then finally you can
[38:30] change a this this letter ok you buy our
[38:34] leather in order to sew on our directory
[38:38] our path and we are going to secure it
[38:45] ok i will have its first i'm going to
[38:50] show you we're going to open the sea
[38:53] path as a proof and if you look at that
[39:00] we have the file test ok and the file
[39:05] test in the sea path so we are listing
[39:08] the risk this is an important thing okay
[39:11] this is gonna be love and you can see
[39:13] all the requests and respond i have to
[39:15] parse and send an important thing is
[39:18] this pocket again the 200 and elect
[39:21] remember that indication my past packet
[39:23] and that's all
[39:29] ok the next vulnerability will be the
[39:33] permanent Daniel of service and the last
[39:35] one using protocol faciem we found this
[39:38] vulnerability modifying that name of a
[39:42] task put in a really big task name in
[39:44] this case and when the application tries
[39:46] to start it always crisis of course is
[39:48] not an explodable crass but the only
[39:51] solution and the only way to solve this
[39:53] issue it's uninstalling the application
[39:55] there is another way so it could be
[39:57] really really annoying the last
[40:01] demonstration video of our last exploit
[40:04] again we don't need my in the middle we
[40:07] can brute force the user number account
[40:08] and the task number will see in the
[40:10] demonstration video was this and we can
[40:13] have the user numbers and task of the
[40:15] servers and in a Geo pocket without any
[40:17] authentication again we will see what
[40:19] was this in the video finally we just
[40:23] need to send them alex's pocket let's
[40:26] see how it works ok you have the server
[40:35] we have this task a simple created as an
[40:37] example we'll use again canopy in this
[40:41] case we will use a network line of
[40:43] canopy in order to send a packet and you
[40:45] have the packet and as you can see here
[40:48] we have the test the task name which is
[40:51] really big with a lot of s and here we
[40:54] have the user number and here in the
[40:57] right the task number and this values
[41:01] has to be right ok so we can brute force
[41:05] these values ok or we can send a deep
[41:11] pocket to the server without any
[41:12] authentication and the server will give
[41:13] us all the user numbers and the task
[41:16] number so we can do both things if we
[41:19] want and then you will send the packet
[41:24] with a network client
[41:31] and here in this case the server is
[41:34] responding with an error and that's why
[41:37] because the user number in this case is
[41:39] not right as I was saying so now we know
[41:43] that the user number is 18 we changed
[41:48] the asian number and room that we we can
[41:51] brute force these values or get these
[41:53] values and this now the service of
[41:56] responding with an okay and now the
[41:59] application the graphic interface is
[42:01] trying to fit the task na name and it
[42:04] will press and if you try to open again
[42:06] you know to connect to the server if we
[42:08] price it will cross blue cross and again
[42:11] and again okay and the only way to solve
[42:13] this is an stand application so it could
[42:16] be fun it's just a conclusive hug in
[42:23] macau server client could be really
[42:26] dangerous we found several dedication
[42:29] bad medicine I producing the same
[42:30] techniques maths and time he has to go
[42:33] Father Fatima reverse engineering in
[42:35] sandton lead us to find more things than
[42:37] doing sort code analysis passing in CC
[42:39] and worse and it's not solely for
[42:41] classes remember handy backup
[42:42] authentication bypass it spin for us the
[42:46] minutes probably you use circle alice's
[42:49] could spend more time brickell
[42:51] indication by clear Makabe cassava
[42:53] sometimes that has remote code execution
[42:55] because it has this theater ambika
[42:59] servers who have more security because
[43:01] they are so critical Alice in our
[43:03] opinion so thanks for our hacking team I
[43:06] were mad guys special thanks to hug in
[43:09] Paris to my friend and family and
[43:12] friends so thank us teens
[43:23] is there any question yeah yeah and it's
[43:36] not explodable I well it was nine months
[43:39] ago I guess over 87 I'm not sure why if
[43:43] you want to know why it's not expletive
[43:45] oh we can check it later but i don't
[43:48] remember right now it's not expressly
[43:50] welcome I think that's it yes we have
[43:58] another here and it appears that you saw
[44:08] one of you nor ability to be on security
[44:11] yeah and is it possible to have an idea
[44:14] of the amount of money woof I told you
[44:20] later

## Retrospect Backup Client uses weak password hashing

#### Vulnerability Note VU#101500

Original Release Date: 2015-06-15 | Last Revised: 2015-06-15

---

### Overview

Retrospect Backup Client is a client to a network-based backup utility. This client stores passwords in a hashed format that is weak and susceptible to collision, allowing an attacker to generate a password hash collision and gain access to the target's backup files.

### Description

| [**CWE-916**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html)**: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort -** CVE-2015-2864  Retrospect Backup clients prior to 10.0.2 on Windows and Linux and 12.0.2 on Mac contain an error in the password hash generating algorithm. The password is not fully utilized when generating a hash, allowing the possibility of a weak hash with a higher probability of collision with other passwords. Attackers with network access to a machine running the Retrospect client may be able to generate brute-force passwords that are guaranteed to collide with the hashed password with a maximum of 128 tries. This attack was [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB8AL5u7JCA&list=PL3UAg9Zuj1yLmemIKw-domjg5UkbN-pLc&index=14) by security researchers Josep Pi Rodriguez and Pedro Guillen Nunez.This vulnerability only affects clients utilizing password authentication; clients using the public key authentication mechanism to login are unaffected. Retrospect recommends that users make use of the public key authentication mechanism. For more details on the vulnerability and instructions on enabling public key authentication, please see Retrospect's [advisory](http://www.retrospect.com/support/kb/cve_2015_2864). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker on the network may be able to brute force a correct password by guessing a string that produces the same hash, granting access to backup data as the victim user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**For users that wish to continue using the password mechanism, Retrospect has released [updates](http://www.retrospect.com/support/downloads) addressing this issue.Windows users should update to version 10.0.2.119 or later.Mac users should update to version 12.0.2.116 or later.Linux users should update to version 10.0.2.104 or later.Affected users may also consider the following workaround recommended by the vendor: |
| --- |

| **Switch to Public Key Authentication**The public key authentication method used by Retrospect is unaffected by this vulnerability. Retrospect recommends using public key authentication rather than a password and has provided a [knowledge base article](http://www.retrospect.com/support/kb/cve_2015_2864) to guide users through the setup process. |
