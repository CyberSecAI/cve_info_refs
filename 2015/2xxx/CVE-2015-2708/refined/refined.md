Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2708:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text from multiple sources including SUSE, Gentoo, and Red Hat, confirms that CVE-2015-2708 is indeed related to multiple vulnerabilities in the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. The description consistently points towards memory corruption issues.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause, as described in the SUSE advisory, is "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine". This indicates that the vulnerabilities stem from several different underlying flaws within the browser engine itself, rather than one single bug. This means there is no single root cause, but a series of memory safety issues.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary vulnerability is memory corruption, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, application crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Use-after-free, buffer overflows:** The Gentoo advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities including use after free and buffer overflows.
*   **Unspecified vulnerabilities:** The content states that the exact nature of multiple vulnerabilities is unknown
*   **Unvalidated messages:** The Suse advisory also mentions an improperly validation of IPC messages

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful attack can lead to a denial of service by crashing the application.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application.
*  **Privilege escalation:** Unvalidated messages and flaws in resource url parsing could also lead to privilege escalation

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attackers:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities remotely.
*   **Crafted Web Pages or Emails:**  Attack vectors include enticing a user to view a specially crafted web page or email.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to deliver malicious content.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without any user authentication.
*   **Medium to Low Access Complexity:**  Some vulnerabilities may have a medium complexity to exploit while others have a low complexity, making them relatively easy to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Suse advisory indicates that the severity is rated as "important".
* The CVSS v2 score from NVD is 7.5 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, indicating a high severity.
* The Gentoo advisory lists several other related CVEs
* The SUSE advisory lists a multitude of fixed package versions across several SUSE products, and a number of security advisories and bugzilla entries.

In summary, CVE-2015-2708 represents a serious security risk due to the possibility of remote code execution via multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, requiring minimal user interaction, and minimal attacker skill. Patches should be applied immediately.
