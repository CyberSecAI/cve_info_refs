Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the JSSE component within OpenJDK, where reverse DNS lookups are improperly handled during X.509 certificate verification for TLS/SSL connections identified by IP addresses. Specifically, in some cases, a certificate issued for a hostname that the IP address resolves to, rather than for the IP address itself, would be accepted as valid, thus bypassing the intended identity check.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper handling of reverse DNS lookups during X.509 certificate verification in JSSE component
- Acceptance of certificates issued for a hostname instead of the IP address, leading to the bypass of intended identity checks.

Impact of exploitation:
- Potential for remote attackers to bypass intended identity checks during TLS/SSL handshakes.
- Confidentiality could be affected due to acceptance of certificates issued for a different identity.

Attack vectors:
- Remote attackers can exploit this via network attacks using SSL/TLS.
- By triggering the vulnerable certificate verification process through manipulation of network traffic.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle or similar attack that intercepts or manipulates TLS/SSL traffic.
- Network-level access to initiate or intercept the TLS/SSL connection.
