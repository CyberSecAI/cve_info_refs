## Security Update for Windows Shell to Address Remote Code Execution (3096443)

Published: October 13, 2015 | Updated: November 30, 2015

**Version:** 1.2

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted toolbar object in Windows or an attacker convinces a user to view specially crafted content online.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Windows Shell and the Microsoft Tablet Input Band handle objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3096443](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3096443).

## Vulnerability Information

## Toolbar Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2515

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Shell improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

For an attack to be successful, this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted toolbar object in Windows. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted tool bar object to the user and by convincing the user to open it. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows Shell handles objects in memory.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Tablet Input Band Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2548

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft Tablet Input Band fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. Such websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes them to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft Tablet Input Band handles objects in memory.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

**Deny access to TipBand.dll**

To deny access to TipBand.dll, enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
Takeown.exe /f "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TipBand.dll"
Icacls.exe "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TipBand.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

```

**Impact of workaround.** The Microsoft Tablet Input Band will no longer be accessible on the system.

**How to undo the workaround.**

To undo the workaround, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

```
Icacls.exe "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TipBand.dll" /remove:d  everyone

```
