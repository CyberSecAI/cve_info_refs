## Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor fails to properly validate SSL and installs non-unique root CA certificates and private keys

#### Vulnerability Note VU#529496

Original Release Date: 2015-02-19 | Last Revised: 2015-03-17

---

### Overview

Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor installs non-unique root CA certificates and private keys, making systems broadly vulnerable to HTTPS spoofing

### Description

| Komodia Redirector SDK is a self-described "interception engine" designed to enable developers to integrate proxy services and web traffic modification (such as [ad injection](http://www.komodia.com/ad-injection-sdk/)) into their applications. With the SSL Digestor module, HTTPS traffic can also be manipulated. This is accomplished by installing a root CA certificate into browser trusted certificate stores, enabling the proxy to effectively man-in-the-middle all web traffic without raising any flags for the end-user.  In multiple applications implementing Komodia's libraries, such as Superfish Visual Discovery and KeepMyFamilySecure, the root CA certificates have been found to use trivially obtainable, publicly disclosed, hard-coded private keys. Note that these keys appear to be distinct per application, though [the same methods](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html) have proven successful in revealing the private keys in each instance.In addition to sharing root CA certificates across installation, it has been reported that [the SSL validation that Komodia itself performs is broken](https://blog.filippo.io/komodia-superfish-ssl-validation-is-broken/). This vulnerability can allow an attacker to universally attack all installations of Komodia Redirector, rather than needing to focus on a single application / certificate.Users should be aware that uninstalling affected applications is not sufficient to remove the security risk since the root certificates are not removed in the process. Lenovo, whose consumer-grade systems come bundled with the software, have provided [instructions and an automated removal tool](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/superfish_uninstall). A list of potentially affected Lenovo systems is available [here](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929).Users can verify whether their systems contain Superfish and other Komodia root certificates by visiting [this site](https://filippo.io/Badfish/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can spoof HTTPS sites and intercept HTTPS traffic without triggering browser certificate warnings in affected systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Komodia has [updated](http://www.komodia.com/security-notice) their vulnerable libraries. Developers who use the Komodia libraries should update their applications.Users should check vendor websites for updates to affected software and apply them immediately. Given the severity of the issue, users who are unsure that an update addresses the vulnerability are strongly encouraged to consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Uninstall software using Komodia Redirector SDK and associated root CA certificates**Uninstall any software that includes the Komodia Redirector and SSL Digestor libraries. Refer to the Vendor Information section below for an updated list of known affected vendors.After uninstalling an offending application, it is also necessary to independently remove compromised root CA certificates. Note that the names of these certificates are likely to vary based on the originating application. Microsoft provides guidance on [deleting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772354.aspx) and [managing](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/view-or-manage-your-certificates) certificates in the Windows certificate store.Mozilla provides similar [guidance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA%3AUserCertDB#Deleting_a_Root_Certificate) for their software, including the Firefox and Thunderbird certificate stores. |

Notified:  February 20, 2015  Updated: February 25, 2015

**Statement Date:   February 23, 2015**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Here's the official statement from the company (on our website), announcing the
updated release which is now live:

<http://webcompanion.com/komodia-vulnerability-statement>

### Vendor Information

\* For the past year, Lavasoft was developing and testing a new security feature in Ad-Aware Web Companion to scan and eliminate malicious content/advertising in HTTPS traffic, including content injected by internet proxies installed on the PC.
\* This functionality was implemented with one of Komodia's public SDKs (the SSL Digestor). At no point was any encrypted information collected or analyzed. All analysis of incoming traffic to eliminate security risks was performed on the end-user's PC.
\* Several weeks prior to the public announcement of the root CA certificate vulnerability, and upon consultation with our partners and evaluation of the risks/benefits, Lavasoft took the decision to remove the functionality that required the SSL Digestor.
\* Lavasoft's most recent release of Ad-Aware Web Companion (released on February 18th 2015) does not include this capability, but we have confirmed that the compromised component of the Komodia SSL Digestor is still present. A new release of Web Companion will be issued imminently to correct this, with all end-users being notified of the update via the product. In the interim, the root CA certificate issued to "Lavasoft Limited" can be removed manually without consequences to the product.
\* Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha) 1.3.69.1 is an unreleased and unsupported product. Alpha testers who have not uninstalled it by now are instructed to do so immediately, and to manually check to ensure the root CA certificate has been deleted as we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the uninstaller in this pre-released version.

### Vendor References

# Komodia/Superfish SSL Validation is broken

*If you are on the ball already and just want the new vulnerability, scroll to the "client side SSL verification" section.* tl;dr The Komodia/Superfish proxy can be made to allow self-signed certificates without warnings.

## Recap

Some Lenovo laptops [shipped](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/?ref=words.filippo.io) with [Superfish](http://www.home.superfish.com/?ref=words.filippo.io) preinstalled - an ad injecting software. How it performs ad injection is by using [a SSL interception engine](https://archive.today/pFrkq?ref=words.filippo.io) by [Komodia](https://archive.today/www.komodia.com?ref=words.filippo.io).

The software is spectacularly bad, and uses the same key on all computers, [which was extracted easily](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html?ref=words.filippo.io), allowing hackers to intercept the secure connections of anyone who has Superfish installed. I made a [online test, Badfish](https://filippo.io/Badfish/?ref=words.filippo.io).

**But Superfish [is not the only one](http://marcrogers.org/2015/02/19/will-the-madness-never-end-komodia-ssl-certificates-are-everywhere/?ref=words.filippo.io) using the Komodia engine.** All softwares that do share the same problem, and [their keys can be extracted easily](https://gist.github.com/Wack0/17c56b77a90073be81d3?ref=words.filippo.io) (same password: "komodia").

However, that's not even necessary, because Komodia is horribly broken.

## How Komodia works

A brief step back to understand how Komodia does SSL/TLS interception and what that means.

On installation the Komodia software will **install a root CA certificate** in the system trust store.

Then when a user tries to visit a HTTPS website, the software will intercept the connection and place itself between the browser and the server.

It will then connect to the server as a client, and relay data between the two. As a certificate to the client it will present **a copy of the server certificate, with a different public key and signed by the root it installed**.

In short, a Man in the Middle attack.

What we all realized in horror is that **the root private key is the same on all machines**, so anyone can take that and sign fake certificates to use in MitM attacks.

(For the record, this could have been a bit less bad if the proxy client rejected its own certificate, but whatever.)

Note that this also means that the actual HTTPS connection is handled by the Komodia proxy client - that is, **it's the Komodia software that will connect to the server over the Internet**. And it's not that good at it: [it will use obsolete cryptography, for example](https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/568598220504494080?ref=words.filippo.io).

Anyway, we thought things couldn't get worse. But.

## Komodia client side SSL verification

At this point a legit doubt is: **what will the Komodia proxy client do when it sees a invalid/untrusted/self-signed certificate?** Because copying it, changing its public key and signing it would *turn it into a valid one without warnings*.

Turns out that if a certificate fails validation the Komodia proxy **will still re-sign it** (making it trusted), but **change the domain name** so that a warning is triggered in the browser.

See in the picture below how the certificate name became `verify_fail.events.ccc.de` to "propagate" the failure to the browser.

![](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2015/02/B-QcLXHIAAAvawx.jpg)

Hm, still bad since the user/browser will receive fake information on why the certificate is invalid, but clever.

**However.**

The Komodia proxy copies the server certificate almost entirely... What will it do with **alternative names**?

Alternative names are a X509 extension that allows to specify in a special field other domains for which the certificate is valid.

![](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2015/02/IE11---Win8-1--28Superfished-29--5BRunning-5D-2015-02-20-15-37-05.png)

Boom. **The Komodia proxy will take a self-signed certificate, leave the alternate names untouched and sign it with their root.** The browser will think it's a completely valid certificate.

So all you need to do to bypass verification is put the target domain in the alternate field, instead of in the main one that will be changed on failure.

An attacker can intercept any https connection, present a self-signed certificate to the client and browsers will show a green lock because Komodia will sign it for them.

## Consequences

This means that whoever has Komodia software running on their system will accept ANY certificate that has the domain name in the alternates.

No need to extract root keys from each software, this allows MitM against all Komodia-using software at the same time.

**It's catastrophic.

It's the only way all this mess could have been even worse.**

They can change the keys, or start doing the sane thing and generate a keypair for each device, but *this bug will still allow MitM attacks*. And with this **attackers don't even need to know what software you are running**, it's a catch-all against the Komodia engine itself.

So all the users out there with Komodia-powered Parental Control software or adware have their banking connections easily intercepted. Well, good job.

~~Yes, a online test is coming. Meanwhile, I serve such a cert at [san.filippo.io](https://san.filippo.io/?ref=words.filippo.io).~~

UPDATE: my [online test](https://filippo.io/Badfish/?ref=words.filippo.io) now checks for all Komodia-powered software with the trick above.

## Conclusions

First, don't make intercepting proxies. They are impossible to write correctly, and by their very nature lower the security of the whole Internet.

Second, the Komodia one is a particularly bad one, and they should feel bad.

Third, Komodia should be punished for jeopardizing the users, like probably all the companies that didn't do due diligence here.

# Lenovo's Response to Its Dangerous Adware Is Astonishingly Clueless

Lenovo says that the Superfish adware it preinstalled on laptop computers isn't a security problem. That's not true. And guess what? It breaks Slack too.Save this storySaveSave this storySave

If you've bought a Lenovo laptop anytime since August, it may have shipped with a dangerous bit of adware known as Visual Discovery by Superfish. It's the kind of software add-on that computer makers are often paid to include with their hardware. Superfish exists to serve up ads, but it does so in such a maddeningly dangerous way that it creates a real security problem for Lenovo users.

Worse, Lenovo appears completely clueless about the problem. The company issued a statement shortly after security experts raised the issue, saying it stopped shipping the adware last month and customers need not worry about the thing compromising their security. "We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns," [Lenovo said.](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929)

Robert Graham, the CEO of internet security firm called Errata Security, doesn't mince words in assessing the situation. "This is a bald-face lie," he says of Lenovo's statement. "It's obvious that there is a security problem here." And Graham knows what he's talking about. He runs a security consultancy and has documented very real security problems with Superfish.

The Really Bad Part

The adware works, he says, by monitoring your web traffic while you're shopping and then shows you similar products to the images that pop up in your browser. To do this while you're securely connected to a website with an address beginning with https, Graham explains, Superfish intercepts traffic from the site and makes it searchable by tinkering with the Windows operating system and granting itself the ability to masquerade as any web site on the internet.

And here's the really bad part: The way Superfish does this is so badly designed that a tech-savvy person could take advantage of the changes Superfish makes to your computer and do the same kind of masquerading. This is what's called a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://www.wired.com/2010/03/packet-forensics/).

For these attacks to work, the victim must first connect to the bad guy's malicious network. Such attacks have been made, however, in coffee shops or [hotels](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7185671/spy-group-stole-business-secrets-over-compromised-hotel-wi-fi), for example.

Note to Lenovo

According to Graham, it took him about three hours to crack Superfish's security and determine the password he'd need to make such an attack. It's "komodia," which happens to be the Greek goddess of happiness and amusement, and the name of a company that [writes software that intercepts secure web](http://www.komodia.com/) traffic. A spokeswoman for Superfish says that the Lenovo software uses Komodia's technology. "We used it for the Lenovo test project," she says, "but that is the only time we used it."

"I can intercept the encrypted communications of Superfish's victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out near them at a cafe wifi hotspot," Graham wrote in a [blog post detailing how he did this](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html#more).

Note to Lenovo: This makes Superfish a legitimate security concern. If you're wondering if you might be affected by it, there a couple of websites where you can check to see if the malware is installed. One of them is [here.](https://filippo.io/Badfish/) Let's hope you don't have it, because it looks like even removing the Superfish software doesn't address the core security problem. *PC World* has some instructions on [what to do if you need to go Superfishing to fix the issue](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2886278/how-to-remove-the-dangerous-superfish-adware-presintalled-on-lenovo-pcs.html).

But Superfish tells us it stands by Lenovo's assessment. "Superfish is completely transparent in what our software does and at no time were consumers vulnerable---we stand by this today." a company spokeswoman said. "Lenovo will be releasing a statement later today with all of the specifics that clarify that there has been no wrong doing on our end."

Superfish was only preinstalled on Lenovo PCs, not other devices, she said. "This was a small scale test to see if consumers would like the feature."

It Breaks Other Programs Too

The Superfish issue had been [percolating in online forums](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Lenovo-Pre-instaling-adware-spam-Superfish-powerd-by/m-p/1863174#M79882) for a few months, but really caught everyone's attention yesterday when [security experts started analyzing it](https://twitter.com/agl__/status/568223255217053696).

Galen Ward learned about Superfish last month after buying a new Lenovo Flex 2 laptop for a member of his tech team. He's the CEO of the real estate search portal Estately, where they use the popular web-based messaging tool Slack for internal communications. But something was breaking Slack on the Lenovo.

"It would be constantly be flickering online, offline, offline, online," he says. They got in touch with Slack's support team, which instantly recognized the problem and asked: "Do you have a recent-model Lenovo? We have trouble with those."

Slack told us it's been seeing this problem with Lenovo laptops since October. The problem is that Slack is designed not to work when there is a man-in-the-middle attack going on, a company spokeswoman told us, adding, "but we were not aware of how Superfish worked and had not designed Slack to specifically defend against Superfish: they just turned out to be incompatible."

Not Too Happy

Ward removed Superfish, but now that he knows about the security issue, he's concerned. Estately is cloud-based. They use Box, GitHub, and Gmail, all of which could be compromised on his employee's laptop due to the security problems introduced by Superfish. Now he must poke around in the Windows computer and revoke a digital certificate associated with Superfish.

He's not happy about it, but he's going to do it himself. "It's really crappy that Lenovo is installing this," he says. "If I had all the time in the world, I'd just take it back to them to make them do it right, but we have a business to run. So we'll do the five-minute fix and keep moving."

*UPDATED: 4:20 PM EDT 02/19/15 -- This story was updated to include Superfish's comment on the Komodia software.*

# Lenovo accused of compromising user security by installing adware on new PCs

This article is more than 9 years old

Leading PC manufacturer shipped computers containing Superfish software that could leave users permanently open to attack when using public Wi-Fi network

[Alex Hern](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-hern)Thu 19 Feb 2015 11.55 CETLast modified on Wed 1 Jul 2020 18.32 CESTShare

Lenovo, the largest PC manufacturer in world, has been accused of fatally compromising user security by installing an adware application on all its Windows computers as they leave the factory.

The software, called Superfish, purports to offer users a “visual search” experience. In actual fact, it injects third-party advertisements into Google search results and websites, without asking the user.

But in order to place adverts on websites served to the user over an encrypted connection, as Google does by default, [Lenovo owners report that](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Security-Malware/Potentially-Unwanted-Program-Superfish-VisualDiscovery/m-p/1860408#M1697) Superfish also breaks the security used by every computer to access the internet privately. Even if the user removes the adware from their computer, the artificial security hole stays active. It leaves any Lenovo user permanently open to a “man in the middle” attack any time they use a public Wi-Fi network, letting an eavesdropper read users’ web browsing at will.

Users had been complaining about Superfish on Lenovo’s forums since [September 2014](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Lenovo-Pre-instaling-adware-spam-Superfish-powerd-by/td-p/1726839), but it took until late January for the Chinese firm, which leads the PC market in terms of units sold, to respond. In the fourth quarter of 2014 alone, [the company sold 16 m PCs](http://www.lenovo.com/ww/lenovo/pdf/Lenovo%20Q3%20FY14-15%20Oct-Dec%20Earnings%20Press%20Release_Eng%20%28final%29.pdf), including the hugely popular ThinkPad range, which it bought from IBM in 2005.

A representative for the company [posted on its forums](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Lenovo-Pre-instaling-adware-spam-Superfish-powerd-by/m-p/1863174#M79882) to confirm that it had stopped installing Superfish by default on new computers, “until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues.”

“To be clear, Superfish comes with Lenovo consumer products only and is a technology that helps users find and discover products visually,” the representative continued. “The technology instantly analyses images on the web and presents identical and similar product offers that may have lower prices, helping users search for images without knowing exactly what an item is called or how to describe it in a typical text-based search engine.”

“When using Superfish for the first time, the user is presented the Terms of User [sic] and Privacy Policy, and has the option not to accept these terms, ie Superfish is then disabled.”

But users report that even if they decline the licence agreement, the software remains installed and even if the software is uninstalled, the security hole it opens up remains active.

Lenovo told the Guardian in a statement that: “Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015. At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in market from activating Superfish. Superfish was preloaded onto a select number of consumer models only. Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish.”

## New root certificate

In order to put adverts in encrypted pages, Superfish installs a “root certificate” on users’ computers. Typically, when a user visits an encrypted page over an HTTPS connection, like an e-commerce or banking website, their computer uses the certificate of the page they’re viewing to encrypt the connection, hiding it from eavesdroppers.

In order to check that the site’s certificate is valid, the computer looks to see whether it is verified by one of a few trusted “certificate authorities”, large security companies such as Symantec or Comodo.

But the new certificate installed on Lenovo computers by Superfish lets the company replace the website’s security, with its own, so that it can insert adverts and pop-ups in the user’s browsing.

The private key of the certificate has already been extracted from a compromised computer. Security researcher Robert Graham [managed to retrieve the information](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html) less than a day after the news broke. The key was protected with the password “komodia”, [the name of a company which provides SSL hijacking software](http://www.komodia.com/products/komodias-ssl-decoderdigestor/).

The information extracted by Graham can now be used to break the security on every compromised Lenovo computer. This leaves infected users essentially open to any eavesdropping if they are using the net on a public Wi-Fi account, and also enables future malware authors to convince Lenovo owners that their software is produced by a trusted vendor, such as Microsoft.

Rik Ferguson, head of security research at Trend Micro, said that “it is quite simply unacceptable to surreptitiously and without consent undermine the basic security of HTTPS by employing man-in-the-middle techniques, or any other techniques for that matter.

Chris Boyd, Malware Intelligence Analyst at Malwarebytes, recommended that “in this particular case, anybody affected should uninstall the Superfish software then type certmgr.msc into their Windows search bar – from there, they can find and remove the related root certificate.”

Users [can check whether they are affected by using Badfish](https://filippo.io/Badfish/), a tool built by coder Filippo Valsorda.

Superfish has not responded to requests for comment.

# Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing

Last RevisedSeptember 30, 2016
Alert CodeTA15-051A

### Systems Affected

Lenovo consumer PCs that have Superfish VisualDiscovery installed.

### Overview

Superfish adware installed on some Lenovo PCs install a non-unique trusted root certification authority (CA) certificate, allowing an attacker to spoof HTTPS traffic.

Starting in September 2014, Lenovo pre-installed Superfish VisualDiscovery spyware on some of their PCs. This software intercepts users’ web traffic to provide targeted advertisements.  In order to intercept encrypted connections (those using HTTPS), the software installs a trusted root CA certificate for Superfish. All browser-based encrypted traffic to the Internet is intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted to the user’s browser by the application – a classic man-in-the-middle attack.  Because the certificates used by Superfish are signed by the CA installed by the software, the browser will not display any warnings that the traffic is being tampered with.  Since the private key can easily be recovered from the Superfish software, an attacker can generate a certificate for any website that will be trusted by a system with the Superfish software installed.  This means websites, such as banking and email, can be spoofed without a warning from the browser.

Although [Lenovo has stated](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929) they have discontinued the practice of pre-installing Superfish VisualDiscovery, the systems that came with the software already installed will continue to be vulnerable until corrective actions have been taken.

To detect a system with Superfish installed, look for a HTTP GET request to:

superfish.aistcdn.com

The full request will look like:

http://superfish.aistcdn.com/set.php?ID=[GUID]&Action=[ACTION]

Where [ACTION] is at least 1, 2, or 3.  1 and then 2 are sent when a computer is turned on. 3 is sent when a computer is turned off.

Superfish uses a vulnerable SSL decryption library by Komodia. Other applications that use the library may be similarly affected. Please refer to CERT [Vulnerability Note VU#529496](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/529496) for more details and updates.

### Impact

A machine with Superfish VisualDiscovery installed will be vulnerable to SSL spoofing attacks without a warning from the browser.

### Solution

**Uninstall Superfish VisualDiscovery and associated root CA certificate**

Users should uninstall Superfish VisualDiscovery. Lenovo has provided a tool to [uninstall Superfish](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/PS500066?LinkTrack=Solr)and remove all associated certificates.

It is also necessary to remove affected root CA certificates. Simply uninstalling the software does not remove the certificate. Microsoft provides [guidance on deleting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772354.aspx) and [managing certificates](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/view-or-manage-your-certificates) in the Windows certificate store. In the case of Superfish VisualDiscovery, the offending trusted root certification authority certificate is issued to “Superfish, Inc.”

[Mozilla provides similar guidance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA%3AUserCertDB#Deleting_a_Root_Certificate) for their software, including the Firefox and Thunderbird certificate stores.

## [Lenovo installs adware on customer laptops and compromises ALL SSL.](https://marcrogers.org/2015/02/19/lenovo-installs-adware-on-customer-laptops-and-compromises-all-ssl/)

[February 19, 2015February 19, 2015](https://marcrogers.org/2015/02/19/lenovo-installs-adware-on-customer-laptops-and-compromises-all-ssl/)

[![boa2](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boa2.png?w=300&h=261)](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boa2.png)

A pretty shocking thing came to light this evening – Lenovo is installing adware that uses a “man-in-the-middle” attack to break secure connections on affected laptops in order to access sensitive data and inject advertising. As if that wasn’t bad enough, they installed a weak certificate into the system in a way that means affected users cannot trust any secure connections they make – TO ANY SITE.

We trust our hardware manufacturers to build products that are secure. In this current climate of rising cybercrime, if you can’t trust your hardware manufacturer, you are in a very difficult position. That manufacturer has a huge role to play in keeping you safe – from releasing patches to update software when vulnerabilities are found to behaving in a responsible manner with the data the collect and the privileged access they have to your hardware.

When bad guys are able to get into the supply chain and install malware, it is devastating. Often users find themselves with equipment that is compromised and are unable to do anything about it. When malware is installed with the access a manufacturer has, it buries itself deep inside the system – often with a level of access that takes it beyond the reach of antivirus or other countermeasures. This is why it is all the more disappointing – and shocking – to find a manufacturer doing this to its customers voluntarily.

Lenovo has partnered with a company called Superfish to install advertising software on it’s customer’s laptops. Under normal circumstances, this would not be cause for concern. However, Superfish’s software has quite a reputation. It is a notorious piece of “adware”, malicious advertising software. A quick search on Google reveals numerous links for pages containing everything from software to remove Superfish to consumers complaining about the presence of this malicious advertising tool.

Superfish Features:

* Hijacks legitimate connections.
* Monitors user activity.
* Collects personal information and uploads it to it’s servers
* Injects advertising in legitimate pages.
* Displays popups with advertising software
* Uses man-in-the-middle attack techniques to crack open secure connections.
* Presents users with its own fake certificate instead of the legitimate site’s certificate.

This presents a security nightmare for affected consumers.

1. Superfish replaces legitimate site certificates with its own in order to compromise the connections so it can inject its adverts. This means that anyone affected by this adware cannot trust any secure connections they make.
2. Users will not be notified if the legitimate site’s certificate has been tampered with, has expired or is bogus. In fact, they now have to rely on Superfish to perform that check for them. Which it does not appear to do.
3. Because Superfish uses the same certificate for every site it would be easy for another hostile actor to leverage this and further compromise the user’s connections.
4. Superfish uses a deprecated SHA1 certificate. SHA1 has been replaced by SHA-256 because attacks against SHA1 are now feasible with ordinary computing hardware. This is insult on top of injury. Not only are they compromising people’s SSL connections but they are doing it in the most cavalier, insecure way possible.
5. Even worse, they use crackable 1024-bit RSA!
6. The user has to trust that this software which has compromised their secure connections is not tampering with the content, or stealing sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.
7. If this software or any of its control infrastructure is compromised, an attacker would have complete and unrestricted access to affected customers banking sites, personal data and private messages.

Below is a photo showing Superfish on an affected laptop presenting a fake certificate instead of the legitimate “Bank of America” certificate. As you can see the user is presented with the fake Superfish certificate instead of the legitimate BoA certificate.

[![BOA-Large](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boa-large.jpg?w=300&h=225)](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boa-large.jpg) [![certificate](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/certificate.jpg?w=300&h=225)](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/certificate.jpg)

The only way a user would know this has happened is if they check the certificate’s details. Something most ordinary users are unlikely to do to a certificate which to all other appearances is valid and secure.

As mentioned above, the certificate used by Superfish is a [deprecated SHA1 certificate](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-sha-1-certificates/) that uses 1024-bit RSA. This is particularly obnoxious because they have installed into the system certificates as an unrestricted trusted root certificate. To put it into context, they gave it the same level of trust and authority as Microsoft’s own root certificate. Users affected by this can go to any site on the internet, and so long as it presents this certificate, they will be fooled into thinking they have a secure connection. Since this certificate uses SHA1 it is feasible that an attacker could break it and hijack it. This means an attacker could create a bogus certificate that every one of these users would trust.

[![uperfish-certs](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/uperfish-certs.png?w=300&h=177)](https://marcrogers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/uperfish-certs.png)

This is unbelievably ignorant and reckless of them. Its quite possibly the single worst thing I have seen a manufacturer do to its customer base. At this point I would consider every single one of these affected laptops to be potentially compromised and would reinstall them from scratch.

Lenovo’s response? Typical of companies caught with their hand in the cookie jar, they try to play it down while at the same time saying they have disabled it until it can be “fixed”:

<https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Lenovo-Pre-instaling-adware-spam-Superfish-powerd-by/m-p/1863174#M79882>

However, it’s hard to see how they could “fix” this software. It’s core functionality undermines the security of SSL rendering the last decade or so of work making the web secure completely irrelevant.

UPDATE: –

It’s not often that things like this actually get worse. This one has. So, because the man-in-the-middle happens locally, it’s clear that the private key has to be bundled with the software. This is because in order to sign sites on the fly, the software has to do that with the private key.

This is really bad practice. What makes it even worse is that they used a simple dictionary word as the password for the key. After a little reverse engineering, it is possible to extract that key and crack the password.  Armed with the private key and its password, you can now sign websites and even software in a way that any affected Lenovo user will trust. What’s worse is you can do it under any fake name that you like. Want to sign a virus so that it looks like legitimate Microsoft software? Go ahead: this will let you do exactly that. Want to set up a fake banking site and pretend to be HSBC? Yup, you can do that too.

Who needs to crack SHA1 or factor RSA-1024 if all you need to do is extract the private key? Game Over.

What was the password they used? Komodia. Both a ridiculously easy dictionary word and the name of a well known manufacturer of SSL products. What’s the betting that they are behind this, and that their own SSL proxy products are designed in a similarly terrifying way?

HOW TO CHECK IF YOU ARE AFFECTED:

My colleague Filippio – @FiloSottile has written a detector for superfish affected laptops. To test if you are affected simply click on the URL below:

<https://filippo.io/Badfish/>

WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE AFFECTED:

Lenovo has published instructions for removing the app:

<https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Removal-Instructions-for-VisualDiscovery-Superfish-application/ta-p/2029206>

I have checked them and they are sound BUT they do not provide instructions for removing the malicious certificate in the system certificate store.

To remove the certificate (which is the worst part) follow these instructions:

1. Go to Control Panel and search for ‘certificates’.
2. You’ll find yourself in Administrative Tools.
3. Select “Manage computer certificates” ,
4. click on the folder labeled Trusted Root Certification Authorities
5. Click on Certificates.
6. Find the one labelled “Superfish Inc”, right-click and chose to delete it

      Thats a tricky question. Ill add some details to my blog.

      The quick answer however is find a superfish remover app online and run it to remove the adware. Then find and delete the superfish key in your certificate store.

       That test is ok but it isn’t conclusive – what it does is present a bad certificate, if the certificate comes up as ok then you might be affected.

       Use the one my colleague put up instead. His test actually uses the superfish certificate to check:

    Our company leases a fleet of about five thousand Lenovo laptops, and has been loyal to the brand since it was the IBM ThinkPad.

    We’re a bank. There is an arguable case for ending this relationship \*now\* because a supplier with that attitude to customer security could do anything – anything at all, and many, many things that are equally exploitative, dishonest and dangerous – and there is no reason whatsoever to believe their assurances to the contrary.

    The removal instructions are inadequate for Firefox users, as Komodia (the SDK used by Superfish) also inserts the root CA cert in the NSS store.

    You need to also proceed to “tools -> options -> certificates -> authorities” in Firefox and delete the Superfish CA.

    This whole thing is disgusting, so please don’t think I’m sticking up for Lenovo here, but (not having the equipment to test) I’m puzzled about the issues involving their local root certificate.

    Surely it is only accepted by the local browsers when they talk to the superfish program, and NOT the Superfish program as it talks to the outside world, therefore making concerns over thr cerificate key strength/password etc. moot?

    Extending on this, interestingly it would bbecome a problem when the software is removed if the client-installed root certificate is left behind?

    cheers, Jamie

       The certificate is used to fool the users that they are connecting to a trusted site and getting a secure connection. When you connect to yourbank, the superfish software talks to yourbank instead of you. It negotiates the connection and establishes SSL between it and yourbank. Then the superfish software presents a fake certificate that claims to be yourbank back to your browser. Your browser trusts it because of the certificate in the root store. So you carry on and do your banking thinking you have a secure connection when you dont.

       The problems dont just stop there. Because this certificate is so weak, anyone can take it’s private key use the password and sign anything from fake certificates to viruses or malware and your PC will trust it because it is signed by a trusted certificate.

       All those controls to stop malware by only allowing signed programs? now worthless on one of these laptops. I cannot understate how evil this is.

          Hi! Thanks for your reply!

          I understand that, but maybe I didn’t explain my point clearly (which was made before we knew that the way the superfish program checks certificates was flawed anyway, making my point moot)

          What I was saying is that with superfish installed, the weak certificate is used for the https link between the browser and the local superfish program. As long as the superfish program itself doesn’t trust the same weak certificate, then it’s weakness is irrelevent, as it is only exposed Clientsuperfish . Whether or not superfish does accept it’s own weak certificate when connecting externally was not mentioned, thus I was just saying that it’s stated knock-on effects were being assumed.

          Following from this, I pointed out that if the dodgy certificate is insulated from the world in this way, then its risks are only exposed if superfish is removed, but the weak certificate isn’t!

          I totally take your secong point though – I was thinkging only about SSL/TLS cojnections, ehich superfish intercepts.

          I hadn’t even thought about software signing etc.

          cheers!

    Is this vulnerability baked in at the hardware or firmware level, or only in Lenovo’s default factory Windows installation? How far down does the rabbit hole go? Has anyone attempted a fresh non-factory install of Windows, or Linux on a Lenovo machine, and reproduced the same vulnerability?

       Its a software package that’s installed as part of Lenovo’s OEM software customization to windows.

       It can be removed like any other package and a fresh install of windows also removes it so long as you don’t restore the lenovo software afterwards 😉

    I have to say I get in a lot of new laptops from the likes of Acer/Asus/Lenovo/Toshiba/HP etc. and the amount of junkware they load these poor machines up with just creates a nightmare for the customer.

    You end up with a laptop experience akin to buying a clown car.

    A lot of the junkware stops you actually being able to use the damn laptop until you’ve finished registering/installing it all.

    Doesn’t reflect well on the manufacturer or Microsoft’s Windows. In fact I get a lot of people moaning about the junkware hassles being a good enough reason to move over to a Mac. But if you just install the junk the laptop works smoothly.

    Junkware needs to come to an end. People will pay more for what they feel is a good user experience, in fact several hundred dollars more…just ask Apple.

    Lists of products from/using Komodia are appearing, probably everything to do with that company has this, I would guess.

    Wasn’t there a firewall called Komodo a while back? I see it’s Comodo now, but they are in a business that is right up this same alley. Though no Israel office listed, I sure hope they are not affiliated with Komodia, but it’s hard to tell.

    Somebody on Twitter said that this is the kind of sleazy trick that the US government pulls, and you wouldn’t expect it from a reputable Chinese business.

    At least they were nice about using the standard Windows program installation system for installing their malware, rather than hiding it deeply like professional malware software.

### Extracting the SuperFish certificate

I extracted the [certificate](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.pem) from the SuperFish adware and cracked the password ("*komodia*") that encrypted it. I discuss how down below. The consequence is that [I can intercept the encrypted communications](http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/exploiting-superfish-certificate.html) of SuperFish's victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out near them at a cafe wifi hotspot. Note: this is probably trafficking in illegal access devices under the proposed revisions to the CFAA, so get it now before they change the law.

I used simple reversing to find the certificate. As [reported by others](https://twitter.com/supersat/status/568317254766440449), program is packed and self-encrypted (like typical adware/malware). The proper way to reverse engineer this is to run the software in a debugger (or IDApro), setting break point right after it decrypts itself. The goal is to set the right break point before it actually infects your machine -- reversers have been known to infect themselves this way.

The ghetto way is to just to run this on a machine, infecting yourself, and run "[procdump](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx)" (by @markrussinovich) in order to dump the process's memory. That's what I did, by running the following command:
> procdump -ma VisualDiscovery.exe super.dmp

The proper reversing is to actually tear apart the memory structures, such as using VisualStudio:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXIecbeg_OUKW2z7b6q9Vk0zfjhslPqon40pbov2KFdFENyxCH75tW56wy4Xjfn9Y4P24QhskvVE7lP7qd0B56SB47WXpRj-NyhAhpdNxJMhMhqm3xtXcILMXIFWUk0W_3nFZh/s1600/super-vs.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXIecbeg_OUKW2z7b6q9Vk0zfjhslPqon40pbov2KFdFENyxCH75tW56wy4Xjfn9Y4P24QhskvVE7lP7qd0B56SB47WXpRj-NyhAhpdNxJMhMhqm3xtXcILMXIFWUk0W_3nFZh/s1600/super-vs.png)

The ghetto reversing is to run *strings*. This is an ancient (mid-1980s) program that simply extracts human readable strings out of a binary file, discarding the rest. It's really a stupid simple program.
> strings super.dmp > super.txt

At that point, I load the file *super.txt* into a text editor and searched for the string "PRIVATE KEY". Sure enough, it popped right up. It's actually located several times in the memory dump.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJNoZg8rtBsHQMEMdg3FE3Sc9wYjksXfIhmN1KRBg85AYo9TpylfczdQ1NBwVwaRgjDIcKwgcumqxenSeg8qS_cGmzFZ1WjObW5ow72RKnzeUEGTo5X7qEkCjp7T_WBgUIRaXT/s1600/super-01.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJNoZg8rtBsHQMEMdg3FE3Sc9wYjksXfIhmN1KRBg85AYo9TpylfczdQ1NBwVwaRgjDIcKwgcumqxenSeg8qS_cGmzFZ1WjObW5ow72RKnzeUEGTo5X7qEkCjp7T_WBgUIRaXT/s1600/super-01.png)

At this point, I copied/pasted the certificate into a file *[super.pem](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.pem)*. I then attempted to look at it using OpenSSL. However, I was presented with a password prompt. This file has been encrypted with a password.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahRDhG2EM1Aizg6QHCg6b55YcXKudgCwlj-3VoUctJspwi0rmGxrNbFpUxEOzXg06uBz2WAcRAdlwaT0X4LYTudGcTbdRUqBfSwi9hDad2mcr38MTC7odg9nUWKE-mK2JkZfw/s1600/super-02.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjahRDhG2EM1Aizg6QHCg6b55YcXKudgCwlj-3VoUctJspwi0rmGxrNbFpUxEOzXg06uBz2WAcRAdlwaT0X4LYTudGcTbdRUqBfSwi9hDad2mcr38MTC7odg9nUWKE-mK2JkZfw/s1600/super-02.png)

Okay, that's annoying, but that just means we need to crack the password. However, I can't find a password cracker on the Internet that handles SSL PEM files, so I wrote my own [certificate password cracker](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack). It's pretty bad, using the OpenSSL decrypt API in a single thread, so it's not pretty. But it's sufficient for my needs.

The encryption is actually pretty good, meaning I can only do a couple hundred guesses per second. This means that there is no chance of *brute-forcing* any password longer than 5 characters (*brute-force* means to try all possible combinations), it'd take billions of years. Instead, I want to do a *dictionary* attack. This is where I load a file of common words and test them one-by-one to see if they work.

I tried the small dictionary *john.dict* that comes with John-the-Ripper, and it didn't find anything. But of course, I don't need a real dictionary. The password is probably also in the clear in the memory dump. I could just use the file *super.txt* as my dictionary! I tried this, but it was taking a *long* time, with 150k unique lines of text. It'd take many hours to complete. To speed things up, I filtered the list for just lower-case words
> grep "^[a-z]\*$" super.txt | sort | uniq > super.dict

This leaves a dictionary of only [2203 words](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/pemcrack/blob/master/test.dict). I ran my cracking tool, and found the password in 10 seconds, "komodia".

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLuMTyEB05Z9ZgCBJvC2JHrdujUCj-OtA4iD0LMppOVSSh6OyMpeX2q9WtJuq0tLOe9bgMsKC7YQthdYDraJhO1yyHEhqqN4QBriRK-3MTo5xtjql44cdPwZ-JZN1DPBBSt_Lf/s1600/super-03.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLuMTyEB05Z9ZgCBJvC2JHrdujUCj-OtA4iD0LMppOVSSh6OyMpeX2q9WtJuq0tLOe9bgMsKC7YQthdYDraJhO1yyHEhqqN4QBriRK-3MTo5xtjql44cdPwZ-JZN1DPBBSt_Lf/s1600/super-03.png)

Armed with this password, I continued where I left off with the *openssl* command-line tool and successfully decoded the certificate. I can now use this to Man-in-the-Middle people with Lenovo desktops (in theory, I haven't tried it yet).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglxTo8SPNmBsVUHShwP6v5v-OGpvZtEDIZc_1iDpOzOsup0Eyi0DPSY78RtvD0J-a5tsDXRZZ3aSbyfRjGYFlztnkMoKaT8M9TgYOwqK9nEb4vxjCcVBCuEwGGnuodOjXs0VYT/s1600/super-04.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglxTo8SPNmBsVUHShwP6v5v-OGpvZtEDIZc_1iDpOzOsup0Eyi0DPSY78RtvD0J-a5tsDXRZZ3aSbyfRjGYFlztnkMoKaT8M9TgYOwqK9nEb4vxjCcVBCuEwGGnuodOjXs0VYT/s1600/super-04.png)

Note that the password "komodia" is suggestive -- that's a [company](http://www.komodia.com/) that makes an SSL "redirector" for doing exactly the sort of interception that SuperFish is doing. They market it as security software so you can spy on your kids, and stuff. A description of this component, their "SSL Digester", is [here](http://www.komodia.com/wiki/index.php?title=SSL_Digestor). They market it for "ad injection" [here](http://www.komodia.com/ad-injection-sdk/). That site teaches us a lot about what SuperFish can do.

(BTW, thanks to @chigley101 for [linking a download](https://twitter.com/chigley101/status/568369711995592705) of the software. Also note that @supersat and @paul\_pearce found the password before I did, though as far as I know they haven't published it. Note that it's Chris Palmer (@fugueish) that first noticed the implications of these certificates).

I strongly suspect Komodia's Redirector shares the exact same certificate.

Yes, I have very little faith left in mankind, why ask ?

That regexp looks like a good way to make your dictionnary very small. Very very small.

@Matthew Aho - to some extent it depends on how lazy the authors were. even just base64 encoding of the password would have hidden it from strings!

The userify enterprise binary has an easter egg visible only from strings :)

The password needs to be available to the software in order for it to sign certificates with the private key. It could be somewhat obfuscated, but there's really nothing the authors could do to prevent someone with moderate reverse engineering skills from learning it fairly quickly.

Sooo.... the passphrase was all lower-case, the name of the company that made it.

It wasn't some random long string of characters. It wasn't the name of the CEO's first pet dog. It wasn't *even* "Komodia123".

Let that sink in a moment. The creators of this system were so amazingly incompetent, I'm honestly surprised it works at all.

Is this detectable on the server end by looking at the signature of the client certificate? It would be great for websites to block or warn people running this software.

Good job! I do not understand why the password was stored in cleartext in memory. I mean if they went through the trouble of hiding a malware deep within the hardware, why did they store the password in plaintext in memory?

I have to ask, but couldn't they generate the SSL certificate upon install. Such that each install of the program has a unique certificate.

Then the cert would be useless for man in the middle attacks.

"The consequence is that I can intercept the encrypted communications of SuperFish's victims (people with Lenovo laptops) while hanging out near them at a cafe wifi hotspot."

How? By just passively reading and decrypting or by providing a MITM proxy that uses that certificate yourself?

The first case would mean that the connections between the infected laptops and "the internet" already use that key, i.e. the superfish https MITM proxy is somewhere in the internet. Why would they even need the private key in the software then?

If their MITM proxy runs on the infected machines then the connections to the actual websites should use the real certificates - and you'd have to run your own MITM proxy, so just passive snooping wouldn't be enough.
(Not that running such a proxy is very hard...)

Just wondering, I haven't read much about the technical details of superfish yet :-)

If they "hide" the password on the binary in plain text, they should at least use something like "m cannot be run in D" as password, as half-jokingly suggested at <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5316925/371250>. At least the reverser will have some good laughs.

not that it matters, but there is already a shitty pkcs8 wordlister out there: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenocons/pkcs8-wordlist/master/main.c i used this with your wordlist and it wordlisted the password in <4 seconds on debian 1GB ram VM.

@Peter Pezaris:
Sorry, but just working around the problem with a tag was (and is) irresponsible.

It basically makes it harder for someone to notice that his PC is infected.

Glip should have made the problem public back then.
Ideally they would have tried to detect if the superfish JS was injected and warn affected users that they seem to be "infected" with "superfish" and should get rid of it.

I don't know 100% if that's possible from the JS-side, though (I'm not a web developer), but https://filippo.io/Badfish/ has found a way to test it by trying to load an image from a https server that uses a certificate signed by the SuperFish certificate.

So now that a way to detect superfish is known, one \*really\* shouldn't try to work around it (so your costumers think they have a working machine), but either try to detect superfish and display a warning, or at least do nothing so that the user hopefully notices that something is wrong and that he may have a malware problem.

By the way, this tag will \*not\* make superfish go away or anything, the traffic still is intercepted by them, the only difference is that their javascript (to show their ads) is not executed anymore.

Is it not that Komodia is a MIM tool which executes in memory of a workstation, between the network interface and the browser? So the traffic between the workstations NIC and the web server is still encrypted with the domain SSL certificate. Then Komodia acts like a browser, using the public key to decrypt the content for instpection. To fool the browser, it re-encrypts the content again with it's own certificate so the browser won't show a warning to the user.

I believe that it will not be possible to snoop https traffic in an internet cafe just because you have the komodia certificate. You'd have to be breaking into the computer and hook in between komodia and the browser.

Doesn't this violate the DMCA terms of attempting to thwart someone's encryption scheme? I'm not talking about the Extracting the key, I'm talking about the MITM attack.

Seems like the company that sells such SW should be in violation and subject to prosecution.

Lenovo would at least be on the hook as an accessory in that case.

@Matt: Even if that were true, it would still be a very bad thing. Lenovo / Superfish / Komodia would be installing software with the capability to read every bit of encrypted web traffic from a customer's computer (credentials, banking information, etc.) They have no business doing that, for ANY reason. Any vendor who feels they can or should do this, can fuck off.

However, this situation is worse. Not only were they malicious, they were incompetent. By installing the same root certificate and key pair (easily stolen) on every computer, now anyone who wants to put in about 60 seconds of effort can forge a trusted SSL certificate for any website on the planet. They can execute MITM attacks against these vulnerable computers and steal all of the same information, without needing to run any malicious code on the vulnerable PC itself. (Lenovo, Superfish and Komodia have taken care of installing the malicious code already; thanks!) These MITM attacks would be tricky to detect; there could be nothing alarming about the site at first glance, unless you went out of your way to examine the SSL certificate and saw that it was issued by Superfish, Inc instead of some trusted, established CA.

> I have to ask, but couldn't they generate the SSL certificate upon install.

They cant. Windows does not allow software to add certificates to the Windows certificate store without prompting the user. The operation occurs in isolated code, isolated in the same way that passwords prompts are isolated.

The only way they can get the extra certificate into the certificate store without prompting a user is to pre-install it on the factory image.

The problem is manyfold:
- The SuperFish Proxy \*doesn't\* do SSL validation for the endpoint certs (the ones from the site). Someone infected with SuperFish can be tricked into entering a site using a selfsigned cert and the user wouldn't even know about this.
- If you removed/disabled the SuperFish proxy, you still have the SuperFish CA in your trusted certstore. Someone can pose as Google, Bank of America, whatever.
Any of these things can easily happen if you are using public wifi hotspots, as it is common for some to set up "free hotspots" that actually do MITM attacks if they can.

I missed something ? If the private key was used to sign the traffic in MitM software, why it has to be bruteforced ?

Good article. One that provides technical details instead of lot of Superfish articles out there with scary messages.

If I understand correctly, Lenovo is installing a https proxy to intercept traffic (vs common proxies you find in enterprises that use http CONNECT verb to proxy https traffic). The proxy is creating self signed certs for every https site the browser is visiting, but signed by the root CA inside the proxy. The browser’s root cert store is updated with proxy’s root CA chain. But the proxy still communicates to destination over https doing usual https validations (like checking for self-signed certs vs Verisign signed ones etc).

I don’t think someone out there in the wild can decrypt data even if they have root CA private key as the proxy to destination site is https session which is protected by destination site’s private/public key pair. I saw articles claiming that they could decrypt https traffic if they are at a Cafe by having the root CA. But how?
The https traffic that gets affected by this proxy is the one from browser to localhost:proxy port. It beats me how someone outside the box can sniff that traffic.

Am I missing something here?

But someone out there can create a site that looks like say bankofamerica.com site with self signed cert signed by above root CA and start a phishing attack. If a customer with the Superfish software press that link and go to that site, the browser won’t warn that it is a phishing site.

This is far fetched and the impact is lot less than what most of the Superfish articles are portraying. Neverthless it is a bad business decision by Lenovo to install something like this at factory. I bet they will have a challenge selling into enterprises with the -ve press that this caused.

A super article.

Two references in the article, labeled, [i]here[/i] are not available now possibly due to a DDOS attack happening as I write.

No prob!. The Products tab at this archived Komodia page [i]https://web.archive.org/web/20141221102728/http://www.komodia.com/[/i] takes you to the first reference, for [b]SSL Digestor[b/] (note this is the "correct" spelling in that it matches the web site, although it is only correctly [English usage].

The description of the [b]Ad Injector[/b] is also reachable from this tab. The Ad Injector product is interesting to me as it gives the mechanism for Javascript injection that can co-exist with global proxy injection.

For example, There is a call to the .exe with install flags, and it can intercept a browser, then inspect it using the DLL or COM framework and decide to inject Javascript or a HTML component.

They could have used a RSA whitebox to sign those fake certificates. It would have been way harder to reverse it.

My name is Lizzy Desler, i am from US I live in Indiana, US, I have been married for over 8years and no issue(baby) to show for it, i and my husband have gone to different places for help for me to get pregnant, but all our efforts
where fruitless. My husband became tired of me and started accusing me of the cause of our problem. I tried to make him believe that I don't know why I cannot get pregnant. But as a
man he pays deaf ears to my words. It came to a time when he gave me an ultimatum to leave his house. I became more crazy and restless. I search for help including where there is no help. My husband finally sent me packing after 8years of our marriage. when I was in my parents house I was still searching for a solution until I met an old school friend whom gave me the contact of this Great Spell Caster pristbabalalokpe, she said he saved her marriage too. I contacted him for help. He told me that it is never too late that I will need two spell in one. Which means an ex back spell and a fertility spell. He actually cast a spell for me after 48hours of his spell; my husband came to my parents? house looking for me. We got back together again. That made me so happy. Still with his fertility spell, I became pregnant after 2months of his spell. What a powerful man. I am the happiest person on earth. If you need any help, I recommend this great man to you, I am so sure he will help you the way he helped me. E-mail: pristbabalalokpe@gmail.com or +2348079125378

Anderson is my name, there is indeed no GLORY without a story. Beloved, i am so overwhelmed that i scaled
through the huddles of life. this won't have been
possible without a wonderful person i met in my life,
whom was introduced to me. in person of High Priest Otigbolor. With all sincerity and a glad heart, i want to say thank you for making my failed marriage work again, my husband is now back and we are living happily like never before. my entire life has been a testimony since i came in contact with you, i am not good in typing i would have typed all that happened and how High Priest Otigbolor stepped in. He stepped in and he calmed the storm in my life. High Priest Otigbolor can calm your storm too. he is one in town and so good to be true. contact him for any difficulty or problems
whatsoever on highpriestotigbolor66@gmail.com he is more that willing to attend to your need and make sure you get a solution and testimony. He has been tested and trusted.

I honestly thought that my marriage was healthy. i loved my husband with all my heart. we was married 8 years and have a 3 yr old son. we bought a house 2 months ago. i told him i was pregnant…then he starting acting strange. he didn't want me to keep the baby. one day i decided to tell him i could not go through with not having the baby (about 2 months pregnant), then he tells me he doesn't love me anymore. 2 days later he tells me he cheated on me and wants a divorce. he has since (2 weeks) been really cruel, cussed at me, told me he was going to file kidnapping on me, and has generally acted like i am a doormat. the other woman even contacted me and told me she is going to be my children's stepmother. i know that the affair was not very long because he met her 3 months ago. i don't know what has happened to my husband. i cannot eat or sleep and only have a sister with minimal finances. i completely alone and scared. i needed help because i don't know what to do. he filed for a divorce with a lawyer. so 3 days later a friend told me about a spell caster prophet.chasus@yahoo.com, i contacted him and told him my problem and what i wanted and after 3 days he brought my husband back and made my husband a changed man, he is now a good man.

THANKS TO DR BENEDICT FOR SOLVING MY PROBLEMS

An amazing testimony on a spell caster who brought my wife back to me.. My name is Andy Sowers,i live in Australia,and I'm happily married to a lovely and caring wife,with two kids.A very big problem occurred in my family seven months ago,between me and my wife.so terrible that she took the case to court for a divorce.she said that she never wanted to stay with me again,and that she didn't love me anymore.So she packed out of my house and made me and my children passed through severe pain. I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and she confirmed it that she has made her decision,and she never wanted to see me again. So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my wife.So i explained every thing to her,so she told me that the only way i can get my wife back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then she gave me the email address of the spell caster whom she visited.{benedictsolutioncentre@gmail.com}. So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address she gave to me,and the spell caster assured me that i will get my wife back the next day.What an amazing statement!!

I have tried all my possible means to get him back, after much begging, but all to no avail, and he confirmed that he made ??his decision, and he never wanted me to see her again.

my name is Monica After being in relationship with kelly for 3 years,he broke up
with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in
vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I
begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I
explained my problem to someone online and she suggested that I should
rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring
him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no
choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there
was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my
ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and
surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4pm. My ex called me, I
was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was
so sorry for everything that happened, that he wanted me to return to
him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him, that
was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have
made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I
would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only
real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem and
who is different from all the other ones out there. Anybody could need
the help of the spell caster, his email is dr.areghanspellhome@gmail.com
you can email him if you need his assistance in your relationship or
any other problem

THE GREAT Dr OBEHI INEGBEDION WHO BROUGHT MY HUSBAND BACK TO ME . My name is Mandy Buyukolme. My husband and I have been living a very happy and lovely life. So as time went on, I began to notice this strange attitude that he was possessing. He was now having another girl friend called Jane, to the extent that he was no longer picking up my calls, and he was not even sleeping in my house anymore because of this new girl friend. I became confused and didn’t know what to do . So i became worried and stranded, , because I have never experienced a thing like this before in my life. So I decided to visit a spell caster online, to see if he can help me out. So immediately I went to the internet, where I saw an amazing testimony of a spell caster who brought someone’s ex lover back Dr.OBEHI INEGBEDION so I email him with his email: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com immediately and I explained to him all my problems and immediately he reply to me that it will be very easy for him to solve, i have been helping people with situation like the one i have. And he also gave me some proof to be really sure of his work, and he assured me that my husband will come back to me immediately he is through with the spell casting. And also he told me to put all my trust in him, and I really believe him. So it was 9:00 am on the next morning, when I was about going to work, when i received my husband’s call, and he told me that he was coming back home , and he apologized to me, and told me that he is very sorry for the pain that he has cost me. And after some minutes later, he really came back home, and that was how we continued our marriage with lots of love and happiness again, and our love was now stronger than how it were before. And he also told me that once my heart desire has been granted unto me that i should go and testify of his work right here on the internet. Right now I am the happiest woman on earth today as I am writing this testimony, and I want to really thank ” Dr OBEHI INEGBEDION” for bringing back my husband, and for bringing joy and love to my life. My advice for you out there who your husband or your wife is acting strange or behaving the same way like this, or you have any problem with your relationship or anything related to do with spell casting, is for you to go and visit this VIA email: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com , and i assure you that he will be of help to you, and I am 90% sure that he will solve it out. Email him: drobehiinegbedionspellhome102@gmail.com

My name is williams martinez.I do not know how to thank Dr. Trust for bringing happiness back to my family. i do really wanna tell the whole world that there is a spell caster called Dr.Trust that is so real and genuine. I never believed in any of these things but when i lose my wife for 4 years, i required help until i found a great spell caster, and he cast a love spell for me, and he assured me that I will get my wife back in just 48hours but i was in doubt, and after the spell has been cast, 48hours later, just as the spell caster said, my phone rang, and surprisingly it was my wife who has not called me for the past 4 years, and she made an apology for the pain she has caused me and she told me that she is ready to come back home for me. Dr.Trust really made her to know how much i loved and needed her. And he also opened her eyes to picture how much love we have to share together. With this testimony right now i am the happiest man on earth and our love is now stronger than how it was even before. I will keep sharing this testimony all over the world. All thanks goes to Dr.Trust for the good work that he has done for me and people he has helped. Believe him and do all he ask you to do and never doubt him in any way.via Ultimatespellcast@yahoo.com or Ultimatespellcast@hotmail.com tel: +2348156885231
