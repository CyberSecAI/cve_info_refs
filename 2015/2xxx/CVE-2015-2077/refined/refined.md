{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Komodia Redirector SDK, used by multiple applications, installs a non-unique root CA certificate and private key on user systems. This allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by spoofing HTTPS sites, as the hardcoded private keys can be easily obtained. Additionally, the Komodia proxy client does not properly validate SSL certificates, allowing attackers to use self-signed certificates with alternate names, which are signed by the Komodia root certificate, making them appear valid to the browser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Installation of non-unique root CA certificates and private keys.",
      "Broken SSL validation in Komodia's proxy client.",
      "Use of easily obtainable, hardcoded private keys.",
      "Insecure handling of alternate names in certificates."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can intercept HTTPS traffic and spoof HTTPS sites without triggering browser certificate warnings, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details, and personal data. The vulnerability affects all Komodia-using software at the same time.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks on public Wi-Fi networks.",
      "Exploitation of broken SSL validation to use self-signed certificates with alternate names.",
      "Use of obtained private keys to sign fake certificates.",
      "Network-based attacks intercepting any https connection."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network or be in a position to intercept the victim's network traffic, obtain the hardcoded private key, and create a fake certificate with the target domain in the alternate name field. No specific software knowledge is required to exploit the SSL validation weakness.",
    "position": "The attacker can be in a remote position, such as on the same public Wi-Fi network, and does not need to be local to the victim's machine."
