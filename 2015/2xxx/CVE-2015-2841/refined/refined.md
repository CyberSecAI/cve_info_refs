Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of HTTP headers by the Citrix Netscaler WAF, allowing for a bypass via HTTP header pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTTP Header Pollution:** The Netscaler WAF can be bypassed by sending multiple `Content-Type` headers in a specific order (`application/octet-stream` followed by `text/xml`). This confuses the WAF, which then fails to properly inspect the request body for malicious content.
*   **WAF Bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the SQL injection rules implemented in the Netscaler WAF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By bypassing the WAF, an attacker can successfully inject malicious SQL code into the backend server, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.
*   **Remote Code Execution (potential):** While not explicitly stated, successful SQL injection can often be leveraged to achieve remote code execution on vulnerable systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be carried out remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP requests containing multiple `Content-Type` headers in a specific order, along with malicious SQL injection code in the body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a web service protected by a vulnerable Netscaler WAF.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the correct order of Content-Type headers to bypass the WAF successfully.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a valid SQL injection payload for the targeted backend application.

**Technical Details:**

1.  A standard SQL injection payload (`' union select current_user,2#`) is blocked by the Netscaler WAF.
2.  Adding a `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` header bypasses the WAF, but the backend server misinterprets the request.
3.  Adding two `Content-Type` headers, first `application/octet-stream` and then `text/xml`, bypasses the WAF and is correctly interpreted by the backend, allowing the SQL injection to succeed.

**Affected Product:**

*   Citrix Netscaler NS10.5. Other versions may also be vulnerable.
