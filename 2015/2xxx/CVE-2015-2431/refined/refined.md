Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2431:

**CVE-2015-2431: Microsoft Office Graphics Component Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Office Graphics Library (OGL) fonts within Microsoft Office. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the `OGL.dll` component during the `DpOutputSpanStretch::OutputSpan` function.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability allows for an out-of-bounds memory write due to an incorrect calculation of memory addresses. The root cause is a sign extension issue in the `eax` register before being moved to `edx`, leading to an incorrect offset calculation when accessing memory via `[edx + ebx]`. The value of `eax` originally comes from `[edi+9ch]` which is updated, and if `esi` or `ecx` has the value `0x80000000` or more, then it sign extends which bypasses checks on the value `edx`, which then calculates an invalid memory location.
    *   **Incorrect bounds checking:** The code fails to properly check if a value, after undergoing a sign extension, remains within the allocated memory buffer for processing font data. This lack of proper validation enables an attacker to write to arbitrary memory addresses outside of the intended buffer.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could give an attacker complete control of the targeted system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash of the application due to the out-of-bounds write, causing a denial-of-service condition.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted Documents:** An attacker could create a malicious document (e.g., .doc) that includes a specially crafted OGL font. When a user opens this document, the vulnerability is triggered.
    *   **Untrusted Webpages:** An attacker could embed the malicious OGL font into an untrusted webpage. When a user visits this webpage, the vulnerability could be exploited.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted document or webpage containing a malformed OGL font file.
    *   The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted document or visit the malicious webpage.
    *   No special privileges or system access beyond that of a standard user is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the Exploit-DB entry:**

*   The crash was observed in Microsoft Office 2007 with the Office File Validation Add-In disabled and Application Verifier enabled.
*   The vulnerability was also reproduced in Office 2010 on Windows 7 x86.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a single bit difference at offset 0x4A45 of a document.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `OGL.dll` component of Microsoft Office.

**Summary of MS15-080 Bulletin:**

The MS15-080 bulletin addresses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-2431, which is a remote code execution vulnerability related to how Microsoft Office handles OGL fonts. Additionally, it covers other critical vulnerabilities in Windows graphics components, including OpenType and TrueType font parsing flaws, kernel ASLR bypass, elevation of privilege issues, and security feature bypass vulnerabilities.
