Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `eval()` function in the `moadmin.php` file of PHPMoAdmin. Specifically, the application takes user-supplied input from the `object` POST parameter and directly injects it into the `eval()` function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server due to the insecure use of `eval()`.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-provided `object` parameter before passing it to `eval()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the server or connected databases.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could crash or disable the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious POST request to `moadmin.php` with a specially crafted `object` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet within `moadmin.php`:

```php
public function saveObject($collection, $obj) {
    eval('$obj=' . $obj . ';'); //cast from string to array
```
An attacker can provide a string like `1;system('id');exit` as the `object` parameter which then is injected into the `eval()` function.

This code will evaluate the string as follows:
```php
$obj = 1;system('id');exit;
```
This allows the attacker to execute the `system('id')` command, and `exit` the PHP script.

The provided content also includes a proof-of-concept exploit using `curl`:
```bash
curl "http://path.to/moadmin.php" -d "object=1;system('id');exit"
```

This demonstrates how easily the vulnerability can be exploited.
