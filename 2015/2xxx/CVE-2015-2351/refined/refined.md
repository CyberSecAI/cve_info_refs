Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2351 (although not explicitly stated, the provided content strongly suggests it)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the OpenCMS application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly validate or encode user-provided input before including it in the generated HTML, resulting in reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website within a user's browser.
*   Potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
*   Launch further attacks targeting the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are through HTTP GET and POST requests to vulnerable pages, injecting malicious code via URL parameters or POST data, specifically targeting several vulnerable endpoints within the OpenCMS application. These endpoints include help pages, the admin interface, and explorer views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or POST requests containing the XSS payloads.
*   The attacker needs to lure or trick a victim into accessing the malicious URLs or performing actions that trigger the malicious POST requests.
*   No special privileges or authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities as they are reflected XSS.

**Vulnerable Endpoints (from provided content):**

*   `/opencms/system/modules/org.opencms.workplace.help/jsptemplates/help_head.jsp` (GET)
*   `/opencms/system/workplace/locales/en/help/index.html` (GET)
*   `/opencms/system/workplace/views/admin/admin-main.jsp` (GET)
*   `/opencms/system/workplace/views/explorer/explorer_files.jsp` (GET)
*   `/opencms/system/modules/org.opencms.workplace.help/elements/search.jsp` (POST)

**Technical Details:**
The provided content lists specific examples of XSS payloads. For example, an attacker can use the `onmouseover` attribute in the URL to execute JavaScript when the mouse hovers over a link or other element within the page. Similarly, the attacker injects script tags directly in some URLs or in post data.

The vulnerability is present in OpenCms version 9.5.1 and likely exists in prior versions.
