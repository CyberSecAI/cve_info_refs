openSUSE Security Update: Security update for putty
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0474-1
Rating: moderate
References: #920167
Cross-References: CVE-2015-2157
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
The SSH Terminal emulator putty was updated to the new upstream release
0.64, fixing security issues and bugs:
Security fix: PuTTY no longer retains the private half of users' keys in
memory by mistake after authenticating with them. [bsc#920167]
(CVE-2015-2157)
New feature: Support for SSH connection sharing, so that multiple
instances of PuTTY to the same host can share a single SSH connection
instead
of all having to log in independently.
Bug fix: IPv6 literals are handled sensibly throughout the suite, if you
enclose them in square brackets to prevent the colons being mistaken for a
:port suffix.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-218=1

Package        : putty
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2157

Patrick Coleman discovered that the Putty SSH client failed to wipe out
unused sensitive memory.

In addition Florent Daigniere discovered that exponential values in
Diffie Hellman exchanges were insufficienty restricted.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.62-9+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.63-10.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.63-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your putty packages.

Subject: CVE Request: PuTTY fails to clear private key information from memory

Hi,

PuTTY suite versions 0.51 to 0.63 fail to clear SSH-2 private key
information from memory when loading and saving key files to disk,
leading to potential disclosure. The issue affects keys stored on disk
in encrypted and unencrypted form, and is present in PuTTY, Plink,
PSCP, PSFTP, Pageant and PuTTYgen.

The maintainers have provided details at [1], and have promptly
patched the vulnerability in version 0.64 [2].

Can a CVE please be assigned for this issue?

-Patrick

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=920167#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-03-02 09:35:17 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-2157   CVE Request: PuTTY fails to clear private key information from memory     summary: Failure to scrub private keys from memory after use class: vulnerability: This is a security vulnerability. difficulty: fun: Just needs tuits, and not many of them. priority: high: This should be fixed in the next release. present-in: 0.63 fixed-in: 0.64  When PuTTY has sensitive data in memory and has no further need for it, it should wipe the data out of its memory, in case malware later gains access to the PuTTY process or the memory is swapped out to disk or written into a crash dump file. An obvious example of this is the password typed during SSH login; other examples include obsolete session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private halves of public keys.  PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key from a disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a copy of the private key, in the function ssh2_load_userkey. The companion function ssh2_save_userkey (only called by PuTTYgen) can also leak a copy, but only in the case where the file it tried to save to could not be created.  This applies to SSH-2 private keys only. It affects all tools in the PuTTY suite which load or save private keys: PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, PSFTP, Pageant and PuTTYgen. If any of those programs loads a private key directly (rather than getting a signature from an SSH agent such as Pageant) then they will have left information equivalent to the private key in memory for their entire run.  (Of course, in Pageant's case, its job is to retain decrypted private keys in memory, so this may not be so important. However, if you ever told Pageant to delete a key from memory, it would not have properly deleted it: it would still have retained a copy by mistake due to this bug.)  PuTTY 0.64 fixes this bug in all the tools.  However, it is still unavoidably very dangerous if malicious software is in a position to read the memory of your PuTTY processes: there is still a lot of sensitive data in there which cannot be wiped because it's still being used, e.g. session keys. And, as mentioned above, Pageant retains decrypted private keys in memory for long periods on purpose if you use it. So this fix somewhat mitigates the risks of malicious access to your PuTTY processes' memory, but no fix can eliminate those risks completely.  This issue is distinct from private-key-not-wiped, which was in a different part of the code and was fixed in 0.63.  This bug has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-2157.  Thanks to Patrick Coleman for spotting this issue and sending a patch.  Audit trail for this vulnerability.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: PuTTY fails to clear private key information from memory

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2015-2157.

This falls into a narrow set of situations in which a CVE ID can be
assigned even though the issue does not cross privilege boundaries.
The vendor is specifically announcing this as "This is a security
vulnerability." (Also, wiping private-key memory is a conventional
behavior seen in many products. It is not the same as wiping any
memory block that any researcher may feel is sensitive in some way.)

Because of the "this bug" wording, a single CVE ID is assigned.
However, in general, these two cases could be distinguished:

  - violating a user's reasonable expectations about what preemptive
    memory wiping should occur

  - providing a UI feature advertised as a way to tell a product to
    wipe a key from memory, accompanied by actual behavior in which no
    wiping occurs

with separate CVE IDs. In other words, there would be two CVE IDs if
there were two bugs (one for each case) fixed independently.
