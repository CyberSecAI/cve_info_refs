Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- PuTTY (versions 0.51 to 0.63) failed to properly clear SSH-2 private key information from memory after loading and saving key files to disk. This occurred in the `ssh2_load_userkey` and `ssh2_save_userkey` functions.
- Specifically, a copy of the private key was left in memory after being used. This was not properly scrubbed from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** Sensitive private key data was not wiped from memory after use, leading to a memory leak.
- **Failure to Clear Sensitive Data:** The application failed to implement a standard security practice of clearing sensitive data from memory when no longer needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** If an attacker gained access to the memory space of a running PuTTY process (e.g., through malware or memory dumps), they could potentially retrieve the leaked private key information. This could enable them to impersonate the user associated with the key, gain access to systems, and compromise user accounts.
- **Compromise of Stored Keys**: Even if the key was stored in encrypted form, the decrypted version was left in memory.
- **Pageant Key Management**: If keys were deleted from Pageant, a copy of the key would still remain in memory due to this flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malware:** Malicious software running on the same system could read the memory of the PuTTY process, accessing the leaked private key data.
- **Memory Dumps:** If the system crashed or a memory dump was created, the private keys could be exposed in the dump file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local System Access:** The attacker would need to have some level of access to the system running the vulnerable PuTTY process. This could be through malware, a compromised account, or other means of local access.
- **Ability to Read Process Memory:** The attacker would need to have the ability to read the memory of the PuTTY process.
- **No Privilege Escalation Required:** The vulnerability does not rely on privilege escalation, as the leaked information is within the PuTTY process's own memory space.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affected multiple PuTTY tools, including PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, PSFTP, Pageant, and PuTTYgen.
-  The fix was released in PuTTY version 0.64.
-  The vulnerability highlights the importance of proper memory management when handling sensitive data.
- It is noted that this vulnerability is distinct from an earlier "private-key-not-wiped" issue, which was fixed in version 0.63.
- A separate vulnerability regarding insufficient restriction of exponential values in Diffie Hellman exchanges was also fixed in the same update, but this is not the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2157.
