##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Version:** 2.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Lync. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts.

This security update is rated Critical for:

* All supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008
* All affected editions of Skype for Business 2016, Microsoft Lync 2013, Microsoft Lync 2010, Microsoft Live Meeting 2007
* All affected editions of Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows with the exception of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* The Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts

## Update FAQ

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems. If multiple updates apply, they can be installed in any order.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**I am running Office 2010, which is listed as affected software. Why am I not being offered the update?**

The update is not applicable to Office 2010 on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows because the vulnerable code is not present.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335). For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

**Are there any prerequisites for any of the updates offered in this bulletin for affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business)?**
Yes. Customers running affected editions of Microsoft Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) must first install the 2965218 update for Office 2013 released in April, 2015, and then the 3039779 security update released in May, 2015. For more information about these two prerequisite updates, see:

* [https:](https://)
* [Knowledge Base Article 3039779](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3039779)

**Are there any related non-security updates that customers should install along with the Microsoft Live Meeting Console security update?**

Yes, in addition to releasing a security update for Microsoft Live Meeting Console, Microsoft has released the following non-security updates for the OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook. Where applicable, Microsoft recommends that customers install these updates to keep their systems up-to-date:

* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (32-bit) (3081091)
* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (64-bit) (3081091)

See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3081091](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3081091) for more information.

## Vulnerability Information

## OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2506

An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to a target system and then run a specially crafted application. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Rename ATMFD.DLL

  For 32-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
    cd "%windir%\system32"
    takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
    icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
    icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
    rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

```

2. Restart the system.

**For 64-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
        cd "%windir%\system32"
        takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
        icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
        icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
        rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll
        cd "%windir%\syswow64"
        takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
        icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
        icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
        rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

```

2. Restart the system.

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (disable ATMFD):**

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key (or create it) and set its DWORD value to 1:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 1
3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

**Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

   ```
           Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
           [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
           "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001

   ```
2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

   (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

**Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will not display properly. Disabling ATMFD.DLL could cause certain applications to stop working properly if they use OpenType fonts. Microsoft Windows does not release any OpenType fonts natively. However, third-party applications could install them and they could be affected by this change.

**How to undo the workaround.**

**For 32-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
        cd "%windir%\system32"
        rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
        icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
        icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

```

2. Restart the system.

**For 64-bit systems:**

1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

```
    cd "%windir%\system32"
    rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
    icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
    icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl
    cd "%windir%\syswow64"
    rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
    icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
    icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

```

2. Restart the system.

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and later operating systems (enable ATMFD):**

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key and set its DWORD value to 0:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 0
3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

**Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
    "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000000

```

2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.

   (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.
