### CVE-2015-2518

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in the `bGetRealizedBrush` function within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). This occurs when the driver fails to properly manage objects in memory, leading to a situation where freed memory is accessed again.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the Win32k component.
- Improper memory management.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.
- Complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Privilege escalation from a normal user to a highly privileged system account.

**Attack vectors**:
- Local exploitation.
- The attacker needs to log on to the target system first.
- A specially crafted application is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- Ability to log on to the target system.
- Ability to execute arbitrary programs on the system.
