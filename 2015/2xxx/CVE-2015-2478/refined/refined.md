- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because Winsock makes calls to memory addresses without verifying their validity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper memory address validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must log on to the target system and then execute specially crafted code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system and run code.
