## Vulnerability Information

## Winsock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2478

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Winsock makes a call to a memory address without verifying that the address is valid. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges on a targeted system.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would first have to log on to the target system and then run specially crafted code that is designed to elevate their privileges. The security update addresses the vulnerability by preventing Winsock from accessing invalid memory addresses.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
