## Vulnerability Information

## Winsock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2478

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Winsock makes a call to a memory address without verifying that the address is valid. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges on a targeted system.
