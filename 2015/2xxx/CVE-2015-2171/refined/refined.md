Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2015-2171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `unserialize()` on user-controllable data within the `SessionCookie.php` file of the Slim Framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that `unserialize()` is called on data that is received from the user without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized PHP objects into the session cookie.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The application uses AES-CBC for encryption but lacks authentication of the ciphertext. This allows an attacker to modify the encrypted data without detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the PHP object injection vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This is due to the nature of `unserialize()` in PHP, which allows for the instantiation of objects that can then execute code.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially modify session data due to the lack of authentication in the encryption, which can lead to privilege escalation or manipulation of user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the session cookie. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized PHP object, encrypt it (and potentially modify it due to lack of auth), and send it in the session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the session cookie value or inject a modified one.
- The attacker needs to understand the underlying PHP code in order to create a malicious payload for the `unserialize()` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The `SessionCookie` class was not enabled by default. Applications had to explicitly utilize this feature to be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability existed in Slim Framework versions 2.5.0 and lower and was fixed in version 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported on March 1st, 2015, and a fix was released the same day.
- The provided content also mentions other vulnerabilities (related to cryptography) that were present in the framework, however, they are not directly related to the reported CVE-2015-2171.
