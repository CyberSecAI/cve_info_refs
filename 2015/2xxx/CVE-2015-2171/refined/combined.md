## Description

[![@sarciszewski](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3710836?u=1491cd961f9a2ed0f4351f4b68375fd46941c770&v=4&size=48)](/sarciszewski)[sarciszewski](https://github.com/sarciszewski)opened [on Mar 1, 2015](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1034#issue-59414092)

<https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/blob/master/Slim/Middleware/SessionCookie.php#L127>

Generally, it's a bad idea to blindly `unserialize()` user-controllable input.

<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection>

**EDIT** - for people who don't want to read the whole thread:

The SessionCookie class is not used by default, you have to actually write your application to use it. So this means that the unserialize() -> RCE possibility is only for the select few apps that explicitly use this feature. The default is the native session driver, which is of course not vulnerable.

# Slim Framework - (CVE-2015-2171, PHP Object Injection), Other Vulnerabilities

```
Product: Slim PHP Framework
Website: <http://www.slimframework.com/>
Affected versions: 2.5.0 and lower
Fixed in: 2.6.0 (released 2015-03-01)
CVSS Score: I don't care. Does anybody really?

"""
Slim has super-secure cryptography using military-grade encryption. Slim
uses your unique key to encrypt session and cookie data before persisting
data to disk.
"""

Wow, sounds great. Let's look under the hood.

<https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1034>
<https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1035>
<https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1037>

So not are they calling unserialize() on user data (hello PHP Object
Injection) in their SessionCookie class, but their "super-secure" crypto
library that uses "military-grade" encryption doesn't authenticate
ciphertexts. Oops.

And even if you were using the develop branch, there were a whole host of
issues with it (h/t Taylor Hornby for his 10 minute audit).

Their readme claims to encrypt cookie data, but this is moot since they're
using AES-CBC without any authentication. You just need 256 (128 on
average) tries per byte to change it to a valid value. Since the client
controls session state, you get unlimited tries.

After a lengthy discussion, I wrote a patch that replaced the serialization
with JSON encoding and closed one hole, but there are undoubtedly plenty
more that remain.

======================================================================
Vulnerable code:

<https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/blob/3a2ac723f17b5d81607287ff28575d38b9fbc70e/Slim/Middleware/SessionCookie.php#L127>

If you are using the Slim framework, you might not be vulnerable. If you
were using the session cookie feature (which limits the amount of data you
can store in $_SESSION to under 4 KB) on Slim 2.5.0 or older, you are
vulnerable. Upgrade to 2.6.0 immediately.
======================================================================

Speaking from personal experience, PHP developers catch a lot of flak from
the infosec community, and some of us don't really deserve it. It's
actually quite obnoxious.

That said, the owner of the Slim framework is also the author of PHP: The
Right Way. I'm a little disappointed that something so obvious would be
found in one of his projects. (Next thing you know, someone is going to
find a remotely exploitable vulnerability in Symfony, or something!) Silver
lining: he rolled out a new version the same day it was reported.

I only discovered this because someone complained that an Anti-CSRF library
wouldn't work with Slim. I'll leave the thought of "how many people could
have seen this and not reported it so they could silently exploit it for
fun and profit?" to your imagination since I have no data on this.

TL;DR - Slim users should upgrade to 2.6.0 as soon as possible. Developers
should stop using unserialize() on user input, and stop rolling out their
own cryptography libraries. Also, encryption is not authentication. Go play
with the Matasano Crypto Challenges for more on "unauthenticated CBC mode
is not secure".

Thank you and good night.

Scott Arciszewski

P.S. If anyone is interested in learning more about writing secure PHP
code, the <http://www.securingphp.com> newsletter is great. I highly
recommend it.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
