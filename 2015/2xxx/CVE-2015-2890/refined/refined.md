The provided content is related to CVE-2015-2890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from BIOS implementations failing to properly re-enable write protections after a system wakes from sleep mode. Specifically, the BIOSLE bit in the BIOS_CNTL register, which enables BIOS protection against arbitrary reflashing, is not being re-set after the system wakes up.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the failure of the BIOS to reconfigure the BIOS_CNTL register (specifically, the BIOSLE bit) after waking from sleep. This leaves the BIOS unprotected against arbitrary reflashing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to reflash the BIOS with an arbitrary image. This could lead to complete control over the system and potentially brick the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves forcing the system into sleep mode and then waking it up. This triggers the vulnerability because the BIOS does not properly reset the write protection bits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs privileged access with console access to the vulnerable system. This allows the attacker to put the system to sleep, wake it up, and then initiate the BIOS reflash.
