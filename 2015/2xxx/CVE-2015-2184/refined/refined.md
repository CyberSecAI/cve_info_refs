Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control on the `/admin/?do=getphpinfo` functionality in the administrative backend of Zeuscart v.4. This allows any user, even unauthenticated ones, to access the phpinfo() output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The phpinfo() output reveals sensitive information about the server's PHP configuration, potentially including version information, installed modules, file paths, environment variables, and other sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information exposure: Attackers can gather details about the server, which could aid in planning further attacks or exploiting other vulnerabilities. The information disclosed could allow an attacker to enumerate the environment for other weaknesses.
- Further exploitation: The leaked information may reveal vulnerabilities in the server software or installed modules, potentially leading to more significant compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct HTTP request: An attacker can simply send a GET request to the vulnerable URL `/admin/?do=getphpinfo` to trigger the information disclosure.
- No authentication required: This vulnerability is exploitable by anyone, whether they are logged in or not.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special capabilities required.
- The attacker needs to know the URL of the target Zeuscart instance.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.
