- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker sends a massive amount of traffic to the FE (Fast Ethernet) port from the GE (Gigabit Ethernet) port on the main board of a Huawei AR1220 router, which causes the interface board to reset unexpectedly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the router's resource management, where it cannot handle a large influx of traffic from a specific port combination, leading to a system reset.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The interface board resets, which disrupts traffic forwarding and can lead to network downtime.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based; an attacker needs network access to send the malicious traffic to the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access and the ability to send massive traffic to the FE port from the GE port. The attacker doesn't need any authentication.
