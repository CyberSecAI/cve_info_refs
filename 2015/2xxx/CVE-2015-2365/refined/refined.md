Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2365:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The exploit-db entry specifies the vulnerability is a "UserCommitDesktopMemory" use-after-free, which occurs when freed memory is accessed after switching between two desktops of which one is closed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights, resulting in complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to log on to the system first.
*   Then, the attacker must run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to log on to the system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to execute code (the crafted application) on the targeted system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Windows kernel-mode driver (`win32k.sys`).
*   The provided document mentions that Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
*   At the time of the security bulletin's release, there was no information indicating the vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
*   No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified by Microsoft.
* The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows including Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1.
* The exploit-db entry provides a link to a proof-of-concept for this vulnerability that can cause a system crash.
