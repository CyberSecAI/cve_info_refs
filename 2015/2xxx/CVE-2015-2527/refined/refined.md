{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `NtUserGetClipboardAccessToken` Win32k system call exposes the access token of the last user to lower-privileged users and can be used to open an anonymous impersonation thread token.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate integrity level validation during process initialization.",
      "The IsImmersiveBroker check in Win32k can be bypassed.",
      "The NtUserGetClipboardAccessToken allows lower-privileged users to obtain sensitive access tokens."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege, allowing a low-integrity process to capture a medium-integrity token. This could allow the attacker to perform actions they would not normally be authorized to do.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local execution of a specially crafted application",
      "DLL injection into a process with the 'immersive broker' flag set",
      "Abuse of the NtUserGetClipboardAccessToken system call"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system, as well as the ability to inject DLLs into other processes. They must be able to perform clipboard operations to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2015-0078, which aimed to prevent access to the token from processes running below medium IL. The bypass is achieved by setting the 'immersive broker' flag on a process via a specially named section in an executable signed by Microsoft. This allows the process to pass the check in `NtUserGetClipboardAccessToken` and capture the token."
