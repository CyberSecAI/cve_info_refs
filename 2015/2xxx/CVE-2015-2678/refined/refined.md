Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2678:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is displayed to the user. Specifically, the 'cat' POST parameter was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS issue. Because user-provided input isn't sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session. This can have various impacts:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers may steal user cookies and hijack sessions.
    - **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information visible in the victim's browser.
    - **Malicious Actions:** Attackers may redirect users to malicious sites, modify web page content, or perform other unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **POST Parameter Manipulation:** The 'cat' POST parameter is the primary attack vector, injected through a form submit to `index.php?page=categories` endpoint.
- **Form Submission:** An attacker crafts a malicious form with the payload in the 'cat' parameter which when submitted will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send POST requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests containing the malicious payload to the vulnerable application.
- **Target User Interaction (for Stored XSS):** For the stored XSS attack, a user will have to interact with the categories page after the malicious payload has been inserted in the database via the `cat` parameter.
- **No special user permissions:** The attacker does not need to be an admin or have special user rights, to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in GeniXCMS version 0.0.1
- The issue was reported by Gjoko Krstic (@zeroscience)
- The vulnerability was fixed in later versions.
