DCS-930L DCS-931L DCS-932L DCS-933L - Allows Authenticated User Unrestricted File Upload - CSRF - FW 1.04 and Older

**Publication ID:** SAP10049

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 12 February 2015 9:53 GMT

**Last updated on:** 20 March 2015 5:44 GMT

**Overview**

D-Link has received a report that a unreferenced webpage on the DCS-931L allows an authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files. By allowing the attacker to specify the file location to write on the device, the attacker has the ability to upload new functionality to the camera.

CERT Vulnerability :: [CERT VU#377348](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/377348)

NIST Vulnerability ID :: [CVE-2015-2049](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2049)

**Details**

The DCS-931L has a hidden webpage at http://<device IP>/uploadfile.htm which allows a user to upload an arbitrary file, to a location of their choosing on the DCS-931L.  By overwriting system files an attacker could dramatically change the functionality of the camera, up to and including running arbitrary binaries provided by an attacker.

This is an authenticated attack, however the DCS-931L does not have a password in it's default state.  The DCS-931L will require you to configure a device password if you register it for use with the mydlink service.

This attack is normally a local attack, however it could be used as part of a CSRF attack against an authorized and authenticated user to upload a file of an attacker's choice.

          This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in D-Link DCS-931L
        network cameras. The setFileUpload functionality allows authenticated
        users to upload files to anywhere on the file system, allowing system
        files to be overwritten, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands.
        This module has been tested successfully on a D-Link DCS-931L with
        firmware versions 1.01_B7 (2013-04-19) and 1.04_B1 (2014-04-21).
        D-Link DCS-930L, DCS-932L, DCS-933L models are also reportedly
        affected, but untested.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
