Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The WordPress plugin "Survey and Poll" (versions 1.1 and likely prior) has a blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- The `survey_id` parameter is not properly sanitized within the `ajax_survey` function in `/wp-survey-and-poll/settings.php`.
- This function is accessible through `admin-ajax.php` without any login cookie checks, allowing unauthenticated access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the `survey_id` parameter, enabling them to extract information from the database or modify data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `survey_id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable function is accessible through `admin-ajax.php` without any login cookie check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers may be able to modify or delete data within the WordPress database.
- **Potential Full Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, successful SQL injection can lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The `action` parameter must be set to `ajax_survey` and `sspcmd` to `save`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `survey_id`, which should contain the malicious SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (no login required).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL and the structure of the target database to craft effective injection payloads.
- Tools like `sqlmap` can automate the exploitation process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `ajax_survey` function in `settings.php`.
- The vulnerable query uses `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."wp_sap_surveys WHERE id = ".$survey_id`.
- The exploit can be used to extract the database name (as demonstrated in the proof-of-concept).
- The plugin is closed and not available for download.
