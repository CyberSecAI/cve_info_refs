The provided content is related to CVE-2015-2991.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NScripter due to a flaw in processing save data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By processing a specially crafted save data, arbitrary code may be executed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading/processing specially crafted save data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted save data to the application.
- The CVSS score suggests that network access could be a viable vector. Although, this might be misleading as providing a save file seems to imply local access, the CVSS vector implies no authentication is required and the access complexity is medium, which suggests a vulnerability exploitable in more general scenarios than a strictly local one, assuming the player could get a crafted save file from a third party.
