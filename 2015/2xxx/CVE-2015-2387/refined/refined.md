Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD). Specifically, ATMFD fails to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: The ATMFD.DLL improperly manages memory objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated (system) privileges.
- Complete System Control: An attacker can gain full control of the affected system.
- Malicious Actions: With system privileges, the attacker can install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Bypassing security mechanisms: The vulnerability allows bypassing sandbox defenses such as those present in Adobe Reader and Google Chrome, as well as low integrity protections like Protected Mode in Internet Explorer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: An attacker needs to have logged onto the target system.
- Specially Crafted Application:  The attacker must execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.
- Chaining with other vulnerabilities: The vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities like those present in Adobe Flash to execute arbitrary code, and then use this privilege escalation vulnerability to gain full system control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the targeted system.
- Ability to execute arbitrary code.
- Ability to create/modify a specially crafted application to trigger the memory corruption.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `ATMFD.DLL` file, a core component of Windows.
- The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
- Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability at the time of the bulletin release.
- Workarounds include renaming `ATMFD.DLL` and disabling ATMFD through registry modifications, although these may impact applications using embedded font technology.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows versions, from Windows Server 2003 to Windows 8.1 and RT, in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
