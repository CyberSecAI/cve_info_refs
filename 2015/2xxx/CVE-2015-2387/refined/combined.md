## Vulnerability Information

## ATMFD.DLL Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2387

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD) when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to a target system and then run a specially crafted application. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ATMFD handles objects in memory.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2015-2387. When this bulletin was originally released, Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Rename ATMFD.DLL Note** This workaround is applicable to all operating systems except Windows Server 2003 due to active file protection. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 222193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193) for more information

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **Optional procedure for Windows 8 and newer systems (disable ATMFD):**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
  2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key (or create it) and set its DWORD value to 1:

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 1
  3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

  **Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

  1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
     "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run **regedit.exe**.
  3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
     (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
  5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will not display properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and newer systems (enable ATMFD):**

```
**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

```

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key and set its DWORD value to 0:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 0
3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

**Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-enable.reg** that contains the following text:

   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
   NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
   "DisableATMFD"=dword:000000001

   ```
2. Run **regedit.exe**.
3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-enable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
   (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

## Vulnerability Information

## ATMFD.DLL Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2387

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD) when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to a target system and then run a specially crafted application. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ATMFD handles objects in memory.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2015-2387. When this bulletin was originally released, Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Rename ATMFD.DLL Note** This workaround is applicable to all operating systems except Windows Server 2003 due to active file protection. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 222193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193) for more information

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F)
     rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **Optional procedure for Windows 8 and newer systems (disable ATMFD):**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.
  2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following sub key (or create it) and set its DWORD value to 1:

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\DisableATMFD, DWORD = 1
  3. Close Registry Editor and restart the system.

  **Method 2 (use a managed deployment script):**

  1. Create a text file named **ATMFD-disable.reg** that contains the following text:

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
     "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run **regedit.exe**.
  3. In Registry Editor, click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  4. Navigate to and select the **ATMFD-disable.reg** file that you created in the first step.
     (**Note** If your file is not listed where you expect it to be, ensure that it has not been automatically given a .txt file extension, or change the dialogâs file extension parameters to **All Files**).
  5. Click **Open** and then click **OK** to close Registry Editor.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will not display properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **For 32-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

  **For 64-bit systems:**

  1. Enter the following commands at an administrative command prompt:

     ```
     cd "%windir%\system32"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl
     cd "%windir%\syswow64"
     rename x-atmfd.dll atmfd.dll
     icacls.exe atmfd.dll /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"
     icacls.exe . /restore atmfd.dll.acl

     ```
  2. Restart the system.

**Optional procedure for Windows 8 and newer systems (enable ATMFD):**

```
**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

```

**Method 1 (manually edit the system registry):**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator.

Alert
# Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 29, 2016
Alert CodeTA15-195A

### Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows systems with Adobe Flash Player installed.

### Overview

Used in conjunction, recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. Since attackers continue to target and find new vulnerabilities in popular, Internet-facing software, updating is not sufficient, and it is important to use exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

The following vulnerabilities illustrate the need for ongoing mitigation techniques and prioritization of updates for highly targeted software:

* Adobe Flash use-after-free and memory corruption vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) Adobe Flash Player contains critical vulnerabilities within the ActionScript 3 ByteArray, opaqueBackground and BitmapData classes. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
* Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2015-2387](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2387))
  The Adobe Type Manager module contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to obtain system privileges on an affected Windows system. The Adobe Type Manager is a Microsoft Windows component present in every version since NT 4.0. The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is local privilege escalation.

#### Vulnerability Chaining

By convincing a user to visit a website or open a file containing specially crafted Flash content, an attacker could combine any one of the three Adobe Flash vulnerabilities with the Microsoft Windows vulnerability to take full control of an affected system.

A common attack vector for exploiting a Flash vulnerability is to entice a user to load Flash content in a web browser, and most web browsers have Flash installed and enabled. A second attack vector for Flash vulnerabilities is through a file (such as an email attachment) that embeds Flash content. Another technique leverages Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) capabilities in Microsoft Office documents to automatically download Flash content from a remote server.

An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code through the Flash vulnerability could exploit the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability to gain elevated system privileges. The Adobe Type Manager vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass sandbox defenses (such as those found in Adobe Reader and Google Chrome) and low integrity protections (such as Protected Mode Internet Explorer and Protected View for Microsoft Office).

### Impact

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Exploitation of the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability could then allow the attacker to execute code with system privileges.

### Solution

Since attackers regularly target widely deployed, Internet-accessible software such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows, it is important to prioritize updates for these products to defend against known vulnerabilities.

Since attackers regularly discover new vulnerabilities for which updates do not exist, it is important to enable exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

#### Apply Security Updates

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) are addressed in Adobe Security Bulletins [APSB15-16](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html) and [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletins and apply the necessary updates.

The Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) is addressed in Microsoft security Bulletin [MS15-077](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-077). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletin and apply the necessary updates.

Additional information regarding the vulnerabilities can be found in Vulnerability Notes [VU#561288](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/561288), [VU#338736](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/338736), [VU#918568](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918568), and [VU#103336](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103336).

#### Limit Flash Content

Do not run untrusted Flash content. Most web browsers have Flash enabled by default, however, it may be possible to enable click-to-play features. For information see  <http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/>

#### **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)**

EMET can be used to help prevent exploitation of the Flash vulnerabilities. In particular, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) can be configured to help restrict Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer from loading the Flash ActiveX control.
