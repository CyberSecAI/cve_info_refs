WTF is unclear about "validate stuff containing userland pointers on the
way in to syscall"? I don't know about you (or the targets of your
marketing), but for me that commit message is an absolutely clear indication
of Very Bad Trouble(tm) being dealt with.
Which it sure as hell is - this thing is closing an obvious roothole.
My fuckup, spotted while reviewing the validation of iov\_iter invariants
(along with several more holes, all added after 3.19 and dealt with in
the stuff that currently sits in my queue). This obviously is the most
urgent one, what with affecting a released kernel.
Again, if "validate argument passed to system call" is not enough of a red
flag, I don't know what is. Especially when that argument of those syscalls
determines the source and destination of data getting copied.
If \_that\_ is supposed to be one of the examples of what you are describing
as "coverup"... I think I'm insulted. Just whom was it supposed to fool,
in your opinion? And if that was supposed to be an attempt to obfuscate,
do you really think that I wouldn't be able to obfuscate things more
effectively than \_this\_?
Incidentally, this is an interim solution - minimal delta closing the hole
and trivial to backport. Next step is to merge rw\_copy\_check\_vector() with
iov\_iter\_init(), do the same for compat variant and provide a variant that
does it by a pointer/size pair (doing the overflow and access\_ok() checks).
At which point iov\_iter\_init() is turned into a low-level primitive (and
renamed to remove the temptation), with validation done at the point of
creation in all the new primitives normally used to initialize iovec-backed
instances. iov\_iter\_init() is too low-level - it was a mistake that had
been survivable while we had few users of that thing, but once it had moved
to wider use, the shit had hit the fan pretty soon. Invariants should be
established as early as possible and in the primitives creating the object,
not in the code using those. Bloody basic API design mistake, with fairly
usual outcome. Fortunately, it hadn't been around long enough to grow too
many users and the hole got caught relatively soon. All of which is
irrelevant for minimal backportable fix and yes, discussion of that thing
\_IS\_ in commit messages of those next steps, where it is relevant. And
those will go into vfs.git#for-next once the damn pile gets through the
current round of local tests (well, in the morning after that, actually -
I don't think I'll manage to stay awake until they finish; ~4.5 hours of
sleep tonight...)

drm/i915: use in\_interrupt() not in\_irq() to check context
commit 6c51d46f135b00c00373fcd029786ccef2b02b5b upstream.
The kernel in\_irq() function tests for hard-IRQ context only, so if a
system is run with the kernel 'threadirqs' option selected, the test in
intel\_check\_page\_flip() generates lots of warnings, because then it gets
called in soft-IRQ context.
We can instead use in\_interrupt() which allows for either type of
interrupt, while still detecting and complaining about misuse of the
page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

target/pscsi: Fix NULL pointer dereference in get\_device\_type
commit 215a8fe4198f607f34ecdbc9969dae783d8b5a61 upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference OOPs with pSCSI backends
within target\_core\_stat.c code. The bug is caused by a configfs attr
read if no pscsi\_dev\_virt->pdv\_sd has been configured.

iscsi-target: Avoid early conn\_logout\_comp for iser connections
commit f068fbc82e7696d67b1bb8189306865bedf368b6 upstream.
This patch fixes a iser specific logout bug where early complete()
of conn->conn\_logout\_comp in iscsit\_close\_connection() was causing
isert\_wait4logout() to complete too soon, triggering a use after
free NULL pointer dereference of iscsi\_conn memory.
The complete() was originally added for traditional iscsi-target
when a ISCSI\_LOGOUT\_OP failed in iscsi\_target\_rx\_opcode(), but given
iser-target does not wait in logout failure, this special case needs
to be avoided.

target: Fix virtual LUN=0 target\_configure\_device failure OOPs
commit 5f7da044f8bc1cfb21c962edf34bd5699a76e7ae upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference triggered by a late
target\_configure\_device() -> alloc\_workqueue() failure that results
in target\_free\_device() being called with DF\_CONFIGURED already set,
which subsequently OOPses in destroy\_workqueue() code.
Currently this only happens at modprobe target\_core\_mod time when
core\_dev\_setup\_virtual\_lun0() -> target\_configure\_device() fails,
and the explicit target\_free\_device() gets called.
To address this bug originally introduced by commit 0fd97ccf45, go
ahead and move DF\_CONFIGURED to end of target\_configure\_device()
code to handle this special failure case.

ARM: dts: DRA7x: Fix the bypass clock source for dpll\_iva and others
commit d2192ea09858a8535b056fcede1a41d824e0b3d8 upstream.
Fixes: ee6c750761 (ARM: dts: dra7 clock data)
On DRA7x, For DPLL\_IVA, the ref clock(CLKINP) is connected to sys\_clk1 and
the bypass input(CLKINPULOW) is connected to iva\_dpll\_hs\_clk\_div clock.
But the bypass input is not directly routed to bypass clkout instead
both CLKINP and CLKINPULOW are connected to bypass clkout via a mux.
This mux is controlled by the bit - CM\_CLKSEL\_DPLL\_IVA[23]:DPLL\_BYP\_CLKSEL
and it's POR value is zero which selects the CLKINP as bypass clkout.
which means iva\_dpll\_hs\_clk\_div is not the bypass clock for dpll\_iva\_ck
Fix this by adding another mux clock as parent in bypass mode.
This design is common to most of the PLLs and the rest have only one bypass
clock. Below is a list of the DPLLs that need this fix:
DPLL\_IVA, DPLL\_DDR,
DPLL\_DSP, DPLL\_EVE,
DPLL\_GMAC, DPLL\_PER,
DPLL\_USB and DPLL\_CORE

netfilter: nf\_tables: fix addition/deletion of elements from commit/abort
commit 02263db00b6cb98701332aa257c07ca549c2324b upstream.
We have several problems in this path:
1) There is a use-after-free when removing individual elements from
the commit path.
2) We have to uninit() the data part of the element from the abort
path to avoid a chain refcount leak.
3) We have to check for set->flags to see if there's a mapping, instead
of the element flags.
4) We have to check for !(flags & NFT\_SET\_ELEM\_INTERVAL\_END) to skip
elements that are part of the interval that have no data part, so
they don't need to be uninit().

netfilter: nf\_tables: fix transaction race condition
commit 8670c3a55e91cb27a4b4d4d4c4fa35b0149e1abf upstream.
A race condition exists in the rule transaction code for rules that
get added and removed within the same transaction.
The new rule starts out as inactive in the current and active in the
next generation and is inserted into the ruleset. When it is deleted,
it is additionally set to inactive in the next generation as well.
On commit the next generation is begun, then the actions are finalized.
For the new rule this would mean clearing out the inactive bit for
the previously current, now next generation.
However nft\_rule\_clear() clears out the bits for \*both\* generations,
activating the rule in the current generation, where it should be
deactivated due to being deleted. The rule will thus be active until
the deletion is finalized, removing the rule from the ruleset.
Similarly, when aborting a transaction for the same case, the undo
of insertion will remove it from the RCU protected rule list, the
deletion will clear out all bits. However until the next RCU
synchronization after all operations have been undone, the rule is
active on CPUs which can still see the rule on the list.
Generally, there may never be any modifications of the current
generations' inactive bit since this defeats the entire purpose of
atomicity. Change nft\_rule\_clear() to only touch the next generations
bit to fix this.

ipvs: fix inability to remove a mixed-family RS
commit dd3733b3e798daf778a1ec08557f388f00fdc2f6 upstream.
The current code prevents any operation with a mixed-family dest
unless IP\_VS\_CONN\_F\_TUNNEL flag is set. The problem is that it's impossible
for the client to follow this rule, because ip\_vs\_genl\_parse\_dest does
not even read the destination conn\_flags when cmd = IPVS\_CMD\_DEL\_DEST
(need\_full\_dest = 0).
Also, not every client can pass this flag when removing a dest. ipvsadm,
for example, does not support the "-i" command line option together with
the "-d" option.
This change disables any checks for mixed-family on IPVS\_CMD\_DEL\_DEST command.

powerpc/smp: Wait until secondaries are active & online
commit 875ebe940d77a41682c367ad799b4f39f128d3fa upstream.
Anton has a busy ppc64le KVM box where guests sometimes hit the infamous
"kernel BUG at kernel/smpboot.c:134!" issue during boot:
BUG\_ON(td->cpu != smp\_processor\_id());
Basically a per CPU hotplug thread scheduled on the wrong CPU. The oops
output confirms it:
CPU: 0
Comm: watchdog/130
The problem is that we aren't ensuring the CPU active bit is set for the
secondary before allowing the master to continue on. The master unparks
the secondary CPU's kthreads and the scheduler looks for a CPU to run
on. It calls select\_task\_rq() and realises the suggested CPU is not in
the cpus\_allowed mask. It then ends up in select\_fallback\_rq(), and
since the active bit isnt't set we choose some other CPU to run on.
This seems to have been introduced by 6acbfb96976f "sched: Fix hotplug
vs. set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr()", which changed from setting active before
online to setting active after online. However that was in turn fixing a
bug where other code assumed an active CPU was also online, so we can't
just revert that fix.
The simplest fix is just to spin waiting for both active & online to be
set. We already have a barrier prior to set\_cpu\_online() (which also
sets active), to ensure all other setup is completed before online &
active are set.

x86/vdso: Fix the build on GCC5
commit e893286918d2cde3a94850d8f7101cd1039e0c62 upstream.
On gcc5 the kernel does not link:
ld: .eh\_frame\_hdr table[4] FDE at 0000000000000648 overlaps table[5] FDE at 0000000000000670.
Because prior GCC versions always emitted NOPs on ALIGN directives, but
gcc5 started omitting them.
.LSTARTFDEDLSI1 says:
/\* HACK: The dwarf2 unwind routines will subtract 1 from the
return address to get an address in the middle of the
presumed call instruction. Since we didn't get here via
a call, we need to include the nop before the real start
to make up for it. \*/
.long .LSTART\_sigreturn-1-. /\* PC-relative start address \*/
But commit 69d0627a7f6e ("x86 vDSO: reorder vdso32 code") from 2.6.25
replaced .org \_\_kernel\_vsyscall+32,0x90 by ALIGN right before
\_\_kernel\_sigreturn.
Of course, ALIGN need not generate any NOP in there. Esp. gcc5 collapses
vclock\_gettime.o and int80.o together with no generated NOPs as "ALIGN".
So fix this by adding to that point at least a single NOP and make the
function ALIGN possibly with more NOPs then.
Kudos for reporting and diagnosing should go to Richard.

However switch\_fpu\_finish()->restore\_fpu\_checking() is called before

So use clear\_stopped\_child\_used\_math() instead.

x86/fpu: Avoid math\_state\_restore() without used\_math() in \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig()
commit a7c80ebcac3068b1c3cb27d538d29558c30010c8 upstream.
math\_state\_restore() assumes it is called with irqs disabled,
but this is not true if the caller is \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig().
This means that if ia32\_fxstate == T and \_\_copy\_from\_user()
fails, \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig() returns with irqs disabled too.
This triggers:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:41

\_\_\_might\_sleep
? \_raw\_spin\_unlock\_irqrestore
\_\_might\_sleep
down\_read
? \_raw\_spin\_unlock\_irqrestore

sys32\_rt\_sigreturn
Change \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig() to call set\_used\_math()
unconditionally. This avoids enabling and disabling interrupts
in math\_state\_restore(). If copy\_from\_user() fails, we can
simply do fpu\_finit() by hand.
[ Note: this is only the first step. math\_state\_restore() should
not check used\_math(), it should set this flag. While
init\_fpu() should simply die. ]

crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption
commit ccfe8c3f7e52ae83155cb038753f4c75b774ca8a upstream.
The kernel crypto API logic requires the caller to provide the
length of (ciphertext || authentication tag) as cryptlen for the
AEAD decryption operation. Thus, the cipher implementation must
calculate the size of the plaintext output itself and cannot simply use
cryptlen.
The RFC4106 GCM decryption operation tries to overwrite cryptlen memory
in req->dst. As the destination buffer for decryption only needs to hold
the plaintext memory but cryptlen references the input buffer holding
(ciphertext || authentication tag), the assumption of the destination
buffer length in RFC4106 GCM operation leads to a too large size. This
patch simply uses the already calculated plaintext size.
In addition, this patch fixes the offset calculation of the AAD buffer
pointer: as mentioned before, cryptlen already includes the size of the
tag. Thus, the tag does not need to be added. With the addition, the AAD
will be written beyond the already allocated buffer.
Note, this fixes a kernel crash that can be triggered from user space
via AF\_ALG(aead) -- simply use the libkcapi test application
from [1] and update it to use rfc4106-gcm-aes.
Using [1], the changes were tested using CAVS vectors to demonstrate
that the crypto operation still delivers the right results.

crypto: arm/aes update NEON AES module to latest OpenSSL version
commit 001eabfd54c0cbf9d7d16264ddc8cc0bee67e3ed upstream.
This updates the bit sliced AES module to the latest version in the
upstream OpenSSL repository (e620e5ae37bc). This is needed to fix a
bug in the XTS decryption path, where data chunked in a certain way
could trigger the ciphertext stealing code, which is not supposed to
be active in the kernel build (The kernel implementation of XTS only
supports round multiples of the AES block size of 16 bytes, whereas
the conformant OpenSSL implementation of XTS supports inputs of
arbitrary size by applying ciphertext stealing). This is fixed in
the upstream version by adding the missing #ifndef XTS\_CHAIN\_TWEAK
around the offending instructions.
The upstream code also contains the change applied by Russell to
build the code unconditionally, i.e., even if \_\_LINUX\_ARM\_ARCH\_\_ < 7,
but implemented slightly differently.

irqchip: armada-370-xp: Fix chained per-cpu interrupts
commit 5724be8464dceac047c1eaddaa3651cea0ec16ca upstream.
On the Cortex-A9-based Armada SoCs, the MPIC is not the primary interrupt
controller. Yet, it still has to handle some per-cpu interrupt.
To do so, it is chained with the GIC using a per-cpu interrupt. However, the
current code only call irq\_set\_chained\_handler, which is called and enable that
interrupt only on the boot CPU, which means that the parent per-CPU interrupt
is never unmasked on the secondary CPUs, preventing the per-CPU interrupt to
actually work as expected.
This was not seen until now since the only MPIC PPI users were the Marvell
timers that were not working, but not used either since the system use the ARM
TWD by default, and the ethernet controllers, that are faking there interrupts
as SPI, and don't really expect to have interrupts on the secondary cores
anyway.
Add a CPU notifier that will enable the PPI on the secondary cores when they
are brought up.

It's directly caused by 89d3cf6 [SCSI] libsas: add mutex for SMP task
execution, but shows a deeper cause: expander functions expect to be able to
cast to and treat domain devices as expanders. The correct fix is to only do
expander discover when we know we've got an expander device to avoid wrongly
casting a non-expander device.

of: handle both '/' and ':' in path strings
commit 721a09e95c786346b4188863a1cfa3909c76f690 upstream.
Commit 106937e8ccdc ("of: fix handling of '/' in options for
of\_find\_node\_by\_path()") caused a regression in OF handling of
stdout-path. While it fixes some cases which have '/' after the ':', it
breaks cases where there is more than one '/' \*before\* the ':'.
For example, it breaks this boot string
stdout-path = "/rdb/serial@f040ab00:115200";
So rather than doing sequentialized checks (first for '/', then for ':';
or vice versa), to get the correct behavior we need to check for the
first occurrence of either one of them.
It so happens that the handy strcspn() helper can do just that.

Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
Unsupported Request responses by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
and subsequently causing (CPU side) accesses to the respective address
ranges, which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
host.
Note that to alter any of the bits collected together as

x86/xen: correct bug in p2m list initialization
commit b8f05c8803fce899d79ca66f8d7f348cf15fb40e upstream.
Commit 054954eb051f35e74b75a566a96fe756015352c8 ("xen: switch to
linear virtual mapped sparse p2m list") introduced an error.
During initialization of the p2m list a p2m identity area mapped by
a complete identity pmd entry has to be split up into smaller chunks
sometimes, if a non-identity pfn is introduced in this area.
If this non-identity pfn is not at index 0 of a p2m page the new
p2m page needed is initialized with wrong identity entries, as the
identity pfns don't start with the value corresponding to index 0,
but with the initial non-identity pfn. This results in weird wrong
mappings.
Correct the wrong initialization by starting with the correct pfn.

xen/events: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dom0 on large machines
commit 85e40b0539b24518c8bdf63e2605c8522377d00f upstream.
Using the pvops kernel a NULL pointer dereference was detected on a
large machine (144 processors) when booting as dom0 in
evtchn\_fifo\_unmask() during assignment of a pirq.
The event channel in question was the first to need a new entry in
event\_array[] in events\_fifo.c. Unfortunately xen\_irq\_info\_pirq\_setup()
is called with evtchn being 0 for a new pirq and the real event channel
number is assigned to the pirq only during \_\_startup\_pirq().
It is mandatory to call xen\_evtchn\_port\_setup() after assigning the
event channel number to the pirq to make sure all memory needed for the
event channel is allocated.

drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c: add .needs\_src\_clk to s3c6410 RTC data
commit 8792f7772f4f40ffc68bad5f28311205584b734d upstream.
Commit df9e26d093d3 ("rtc: s3c: add support for RTC of Exynos3250 SoC")
added an "rtc\_src" DT property to specify the clock used as a source to
the S3C real-time clock.
Not all SoCs needs this so commit eaf3a659086e ("drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c:
fix initialization failure without rtc source clock") changed to check
the struct s3c\_rtc\_data .needs\_src\_clk to conditionally grab the clock.
But that commit didn't update the data for each IP version so the RTC
broke on the boards that needs a source clock. This is the case of at
least Exynos5250 and Exynos5440 which uses the s3c6410 RTC IP block.
This commit fixes the S3C rtc on the Exynos5250 Snow and Exynos5420
Peach Pit and Pi Chromebooks.

drm/i915: add poweroff\_late handler
The problem seems to be that after the kernel puts the device into D3
the BIOS still tries to access it, or otherwise assumes that it's in D0.
This is clearly bogus, since ACPI mandates that devices are put into D3
by the OSPM if they are not wake-up sources. In the future we want to
unify more of the driver's runtime and system suspend paths, for example
by skipping all the system suspend/hibernation hooks if the device is
runtime suspended already. Accordingly for all other platforms the goal
is still to properly power down the device during hibernation.
v2:
- Another GEN4 Lenovo laptop had the same issue, while platforms from
other vendors (including mobile and desktop, GEN4 and non-GEN4) seem
to work fine. Based on this apply the workaround on all GEN4 Lenovo
platforms.
- add code comment about failing platforms (Ville)

drm: Support legacy cursor ioctls via universal planes when possible (v4)
The isn't too disastrous since fbs are small, we only create one when the
cursor bo gets changed and ultimately they'll be reaped when the window
server restarts.
Conceptually we'd want to just pass NULL for file\_priv when creating it,
but the driver needs the file to lookup the underlying buffer object for
cursor id. Instead let's move the file\_priv linking out of
add\_framebuffer\_internal() into the addfb ioctl implementation, which is
the only place it is needed. And also rename the function for a more
accurate since it only creates the fb, but doesn't add it anywhere.

This reverts commit e4df3a0b6228
("i2c: core: Dispose OF IRQ mapping at client removal time")
Calling irq\_dispose\_mapping() will destroy the mapping and disassociate
the IRQ from the IRQ chip to which it belongs. Keeping it is OK, because
existent mappings are reused properly.
Also, this commit breaks drivers using devm\* for IRQ management on
OF-based systems because devm\* cleanup happens in device code, after
bus's remove() method returns.

mm: cma: fix CMA aligned offset calculation
commit 850fc430f47aad52092deaaeb32b99f97f0e6aca upstream.
The CMA aligned offset calculation is incorrect for non-zero order\_per\_bit
values.
For example, if cma->order\_per\_bit=1, cma->base\_pfn= 0x2f800000 and
align\_order=12, the function returns a value of 0x17c00 instead of 0x400.
This patch fixes the CMA aligned offset calculation.
The previous calculation was wrong and would return too-large values for
the offset, so that when cma\_alloc looks for free pages in the bitmap with
the requested alignment > order\_per\_bit, it starts too far into the bitmap
and so CMA allocations will fail despite there actually being plenty of
free pages remaining. It will also probably have the wrong alignment.
With this change, we will get the correct offset into the bitmap.
One affected user is powerpc KVM, which has kvm\_cma->order\_per\_bit set to
KVM\_CMA\_CHUNK\_ORDER - PAGE\_SHIFT, or 18 - 12 = 6.

do\_writepages()
nilfs\_writepage()
nilfs\_construct\_dsync\_segment()
nilfs\_transaction\_lock() --> deadlock
This can happen if commit 7ef3ff2fea8b ("nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment
constructor over I\_SYNC flag") is applied and roll-forward recovery was
performed at mount time. The roll-forward recovery can happen if datasync
write is done and the file system crashes immediately after that. For
instance, we can reproduce the issue with the following steps:
< nilfs2 is mounted on /nilfs (device: /dev/sdb1) >
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test bs=4k count=1 && sync
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test conv=notrunc oflag=dsync bs=4k
count=1 && reboot -nfh
< the system will immediately reboot >
# mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sdb1 /nilfs
The deadlock occurs because iput() can run segment constructor through
writeback\_single\_inode() if MS\_ACTIVE flag is not set on sb->s\_flags. The
above commit changed segment constructor so that it calls iput()
asynchronously for inodes with i\_nlink == 0, but that change was
imperfect.
This fixes the another deadlock by deferring iput() in segment constructor
even for the case that mount is not finished, that is, for the case that
MS\_ACTIVE flag is not set.

regulator: core: Fix enable GPIO reference counting
commit 29d62ec5f87fbeec8413e2215ddad12e7f972e4c upstream.
Normally \_regulator\_do\_enable() isn't called on an already-enabled
rdev. That's because the main caller, \_regulator\_enable() always
calls \_regulator\_is\_enabled() and only calls \_regulator\_do\_enable() if
the rdev was not already enabled.
However, there is one caller of \_regulator\_do\_enable() that doesn't
check: regulator\_suspend\_finish(). While we might want to make
regulator\_suspend\_finish() behave more like \_regulator\_enable(), it's
probably also a good idea to make \_regulator\_do\_enable() robust if it
is called on an already enabled rdev.
At the moment, \_regulator\_do\_enable() is \_not\_ robust for already
enabled rdevs if we're using an ena\_pin. Each time
\_regulator\_do\_enable() is called for an rdev using an ena\_pin the
reference count of the ena\_pin is incremented even if the rdev was
already enabled. This is not as intended because the ena\_pin is for
something else: for keeping track of how many active rdevs there are
sharing the same ena\_pin.
Here's how the reference counting works here:
\* Each time \_regulator\_enable() is called we increment
rdev->use\_count, so \_regulator\_enable() calls need to be balanced
with \_regulator\_disable() calls.
\* There is no explicit reference counting in \_regulator\_do\_enable()
which is normally just a warapper around rdev->desc->ops->enable()
with code for supporting delays. It's not expected that the
"ops->enable()" call do reference counting.
\* Since regulator\_ena\_gpio\_ctrl() does have reference counting
(handling the sharing of the pin amongst multiple rdevs), we
shouldn't call it if the current rdev is already enabled.
Note that as part of this we cleanup (remove) the initting of
ena\_gpio\_state in regulator\_register(). In \_regulator\_do\_enable(),
\_regulator\_do\_disable() and \_regulator\_is\_enabled() is is clear that
ena\_gpio\_state should be the state of whether this particular rdev has
requested the GPIO be enabled. regulator\_register() was initting it
as the actual state of the pin.

regulator: Only enable disabled regulators on resume
commit 0548bf4f5ad6fc3bd93c4940fa48078b34609682 upstream.
The \_regulator\_do\_enable() call ought to be a no-op when called on an
already-enabled regulator. However, as an optimization
\_regulator\_enable() doesn't call \_regulator\_do\_enable() on an already
enabled regulator. That means we never test the case of calling
\_regulator\_do\_enable() during normal usage and there may be hidden
bugs or warnings. We have seen warnings issued by the tps65090 driver
and bugs when using the GPIO enable pin.
Let's match the same optimization that \_regulator\_enable() in
regulator\_suspend\_finish(). That may speed up suspend/resume and also
avoids exposing hidden bugs.

regulator: rk808: Set the enable time for LDOs
commit 28249b0c2fa361cdac450a6f40242ed45408a24f upstream.
The LDOs are documented in the rk808 datasheet to have a soft start
time of 400us. Add that to the driver. If this time takes longer on
a certain board the device tree should be able to override with
"regulator-enable-ramp-delay".
This fixes some dw\_mmc probing problems (together with other patches
posted to the mmc maiing lists) on rk3288.

net: fec: fix rcv is not last issue when do suspend/resume test
commit 61615cd27e2fdcf698261ba77c7d93f7a7739c65 upstream.
When do suspend/resume stress test, some log shows "rcv is not +last".
The issue is that enet suspend will disable phy clock, phy link down,
after resume back, enet MAC redo initial and ready to tx/rx packet,
but phy still is not ready which is doing auto-negotiation. When phy
link is not up, don't schdule napi soft irq.
[Peter]
It has fixed kernel panic after long time suspend/resume test
with nfs rootfs.

mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix PIO FIFO draining
commit 8dad0386b97c4bd6edd56752ca7f2e735fe5beb4 upstream.
The NDDB register holds the data that are needed by the read and write
commands.
However, during a read PIO access, the datasheet specifies that after each 32
bytes read in that register, when BCH is enabled, we have to make sure that the
RDDREQ bit is set in the NDSR register.
This fixes an issue that was seen on the Armada 385, and presumably other mvebu
SoCs, when a read on a newly erased page would end up in the driver reporting a
timeout from the NAND.

ALSA: hda - Treat stereo-to-mono mix properly
commit cc261738add93947d138d2fabad9f4dbed4e5c00 upstream.
The commit [ef403edb7558: ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for
mono channel widgets] fixed the handling of mono widgets in general,
but it still misses an exceptional case: namely, a mono mixer widget
taking a single stereo input. In this case, it has stereo volumes
although it's a mono widget, and thus we have to take care of both
left and right input channels, as stated in HD-audio spec ("7.1.3
Widget Interconnection Rules").
This patch covers this missing piece by adding proper checks of stereo
amps in both the generic parser and the proc output codes.

ALSA: hda - Fix regression of HD-audio controller fallback modes
commit a1f3f1ca66bd12c339b17a0c2ef93a093f90a277 upstream.
The commit [63e51fd708f5: ALSA: hda - Don't take unresponsive D3
transition too serious] introduced a conditional fallback behavior to
the HD-audio controller depending on the flag set. However, it
introduced a silly bug, too, that the flag was evaluated in a reverse
way. This resulted in a regression of HD-audio controller driver
where it can't go to the fallback mode at communication errors.
Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this didn't come up until recently
because the affected code path is an error handling that happens only
on an unstable hardware chip. Most of recent chips work stably, thus
they didn't hit this problem. Now, we've got a regression report with
a VIA chip, and this seems indeed requiring the fallback to the
polling mode, and finally the bug was revealed.
The fix is a oneliner to remove the wrong logical NOT in the check.
(Lesson learned - be careful about double negation.)
The bug should be backported to stable, but the patch won't be
applicable to 3.13 or earlier because of the code splits. The stable
fix patches for earlier kernels will be posted later manually.

ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for mono channel widgets
commit ef403edb75580a3ec5d155f5de82155f0419c621 upstream.
The current HDA generic parser initializes / modifies the amp values
always in stereo, but this seems causing the problem on ALC3229 codec
that has a few mono channel widgets: namely, these mono widgets react
to actions for both channels equally.
In the driver code, we do care the mono channel and create a control
only for the left channel (as defined in HD-audio spec) for such a
node. When the control is updated, only the left channel value is
changed. However, in the resume, the right channel value is also
restored from the initial value we took as stereo, and this overwrites
the left channel value. This ends up being the silent output as the
right channel has been never touched and remains muted.
This patch covers the places where unconditional stereo amp accesses
are done and converts to the conditional accesses.

spi: pl022: Fix race in giveback() leading to driver lock-up
commit cd6fa8d2ca53cac3226fdcffcf763be390abae32 upstream.
Commit fd316941c ("spi/pl022: disable port when unused") introduced a race,
which leads to possible driver lock up (easily reproducible on SMP).
The problem happens in giveback() function where the completion of the transfer
is signalled to SPI subsystem and then the HW SPI controller is disabled. Another
transfer might be setup in between, which brings driver in locked-up state.
Exact event sequence on SMP:
core0 core1
=> pump\_transfers()
/\* message->state == STATE\_DONE \*/
=> giveback()
=> spi\_finalize\_current\_message()
=> pl022\_unprepare\_transfer\_hardware()
=> pl022\_transfer\_one\_message
=> flush()
=> do\_interrupt\_dma\_transfer()
=> set\_up\_next\_transfer()
/\* Enable SSP, turn on interrupts \*/
writew((readw(SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) |
SSP\_CR1\_MASK\_SSE), SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
...
=> pl022\_interrupt\_handler()
=> readwriter()
/\* disable the SPI/SSP operation \*/
=> writew((readw(SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) &
(~SSP\_CR1\_MASK\_SSE)), SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
Lockup! SPI controller is disabled and the data will never be received. Whole
SPI subsystem is waiting for transfer ACK and blocked.
So, only signal transfer completion after disabling the controller.

spi: atmel: Fix interrupt setup for PDC transfers
commit 76e1d14b316d6f501ebc001e7a5d86b24ce5b615 upstream.
Additionally to the current DMA transfer the PDC allows to set up a next DMA
transfer. This is useful for larger SPI transfers.
The driver currently waits for ENDRX as end of the transfer. But ENDRX is set
when the current DMA transfer is done (RCR = 0), i.e. it doesn't include the
next DMA transfer.
Thus a subsequent SPI transfer could be started although there is currently a
transfer in progress. This can cause invalid accesses to the SPI slave devices
and to SPI transfer errors.
This issue has been observed on a hardware with a M25P128 SPI NOR flash.
So instead of ENDRX we should wait for RXBUFF. This flag is set if there is
no more DMA transfer in progress (RCR = RNCR = 0).

tpm/ibmvtpm: Additional LE support for tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
commit 62dfd912ab3b5405b6fe72d0135c37e9648071f1 upstream.
Problem: When IMA and VTPM are both enabled in kernel config,
kernel hangs during bootup on LE OS.
Why?: IMA calls tpm\_pcr\_read() which results in tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
and tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv getting called. A trace showed that
tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv was hanging.
Resolution: tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv was hanging because tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
was sending CRQ message that probably did not make much sense
to phype because of Endianness. The fix below sends correctly
converted CRQ for LE. This was not caught before because it
seems IMA is not enabled by default in kernel config and
IMA exercises this particular code path in vtpm.
Tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in kernel config and VTPM
enabled on both a BE OS and a LE OS ppc64 lpar. This exercised
CRQ and TPM command code paths in vtpm.
Patch is against Peter's tpmdd tree on github which included
Vicky's previous vtpm le patches.

cpuset: Fix cpuset sched\_relax\_domain\_level
commit 283cb41f426b723a0255702b761b0fc5d1b53a81 upstream.
The cpuset.sched\_relax\_domain\_level can control how far we do
immediate load balancing on a system. However, it was found on recent
kernels that echo'ing a value into cpuset.sched\_relax\_domain\_level
did not reduce any immediate load balancing.
The reason this occurred was because the update\_domain\_attr\_tree() traversal
did not update for the "top\_cpuset". This resulted in nothing being changed
when modifying the sched\_relax\_domain\_level parameter.
This patch is able to address that problem by having update\_domain\_attr\_tree()
allow updates for the root in the cpuset traversal.

seq\_buf: Fix seq\_buf\_bprintf() truncation
commit 4d4eb4d4fbd9403682e2b75117b6b895531d8e01 upstream.
In seq\_buf\_bprintf(), bstr\_printf() is used to copy the format into the
buffer remaining in the seq\_buf structure. The return of bstr\_printf()
is the amount of characters written to the buffer excluding the '\0',
unless the line was truncated!
If the line copied does not fit, it is truncated, and a '\0' is added
to the end of the buffer. But in this case, '\0' is included in the length
of the line written. To know if the buffer had overflowed, the return
length will be the same or greater than the length of the buffer passed in.
The check in seq\_buf\_bprintf() only checked if the length returned from
bstr\_printf() would fit in the buffer, as the seq\_buf\_bprintf() is only
to be an all or nothing command. It either writes all the string into
the seq\_buf, or none of it. If the string is truncated, the pointers
inside the seq\_buf must be reset to what they were when the function was
called. This is not the case. On overflow, it copies only part of the string.
The fix is to change the overflow check to see if the length returned from
bstr\_printf() is less than the length remaining in the seq\_buf buffer, and not
if it is less than or equal to as it currently does. Then seq\_buf\_bprintf()
will know if the write from bstr\_printf() was truncated or not.

workqueue: fix hang involving racing cancel[\_delayed]\_work\_sync()'s for PREEMPT\_NONE
commit 8603e1b30027f943cc9c1eef2b291d42c3347af1 upstream.
cancel[\_delayed]\_work\_sync() are implemented using
\_\_cancel\_work\_timer() which grabs the PENDING bit using
try\_to\_grab\_pending() and then flushes the work item with PENDING set
to prevent the on-going execution of the work item from requeueing
itself.
try\_to\_grab\_pending() can always grab PENDING bit without blocking
except when someone else is doing the above flushing during
cancelation. In that case, try\_to\_grab\_pending() returns -ENOENT. In
this case, \_\_cancel\_work\_timer() currently invokes flush\_work(). The
assumption is that the completion of the work item is what the other
canceling task would be waiting for too and thus waiting for the same
condition and retrying should allow forward progress without excessive
busy looping
Unfortunately, this doesn't work if preemption is disabled or the
latter task has real time priority. Let's say task A just got woken
up from flush\_work() by the completion of the target work item. If,
before task A starts executing, task B gets scheduled and invokes
\_\_cancel\_work\_timer() on the same work item, its try\_to\_grab\_pending()
will return -ENOENT as the work item is still being canceled by task A
and flush\_work() will also immediately return false as the work item
is no longer executing. This puts task B in a busy loop possibly
preventing task A from executing and clearing the canceling state on
the work item leading to a hang.

}
This patch removes the possible hang by updating \_\_cancel\_work\_timer()
to explicitly wait for clearing of CANCELING rather than invoking
flush\_work() after try\_to\_grab\_pending() fails with -ENOENT.

can: kvaser\_usb: Read all messages in a bulk-in URB buffer
commit 2fec5104f9c61de4cf2205aa355101e19a81f490 upstream.
The Kvaser firmware can only read and write messages that are
not crossing the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary. While
receiving commands from the CAN device, if the next command in
the same URB buffer crossed that max packet size boundary, the
firmware puts a zero-length placeholder command in its place
then moves the real command to the next boundary mark.
The driver did not recognize such behavior, leading to missing
a good number of rx events during a heavy rx load session.
Moreover, a tx URB context only gets freed upon receiving its
respective tx ACK event. Over time, the free tx URB contexts
pool gets depleted due to the missing ACK events. Consequently,
the netif transmission queue gets \_\_permanently\_\_ stopped; no
frames could be sent again except after restarting the CAN
newtwork interface.

can: add missing initialisations in CAN related skbuffs
commit 969439016d2cf61fef53a973d7e6d2061c3793b1 upstream.
When accessing CAN network interfaces with AF\_PACKET sockets e.g. by dhclient
this can lead to a skb\_under\_panic due to missing skb initialisations.
Add the missing initialisations at the CAN skbuff creation times on driver
level (rx path) and in the network layer (tx path).

ftrace: Fix ftrace enable ordering of sysctl ftrace\_enabled
commit 524a38682573b2e15ab6317ccfe50280441514be upstream.
Some archs (specifically PowerPC), are sensitive with the ordering of
the enabling of the calls to function tracing and setting of the
function to use to be traced.
That is, update\_ftrace\_function() sets what function the ftrace\_caller
trampoline should call. Some archs require this to be set before
calling ftrace\_run\_update\_code().
Another bug was discovered, that ftrace\_startup\_sysctl() called
ftrace\_run\_update\_code() directly. If the function the ftrace\_caller
trampoline changes, then it will not be updated. Instead a call
to ftrace\_startup\_enable() should be called because it tests to see
if the callback changed since the code was disabled, and will
tell the arch to update appropriately. Most archs do not need this
notification, but PowerPC does.
The problem could be seen by the following commands:
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
The trace will show that function tracing was not active.

ftrace: Fix en(dis)able graph caller when en(dis)abling record via sysctl
commit 1619dc3f8f555ee1cdd3c75db3885d5715442b12 upstream.
When ftrace is enabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
ftrace\_graph\_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
FTRACE\_START\_FUNC\_RET command to ftrace\_run\_update\_code(). Similarly, when
ftrace is disabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
ftrace\_graph\_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
FTRACE\_STOP\_FUNC\_RET command to ftrace\_run\_update\_code().
Consider the following situation.
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
After this ftrace\_enabled = 0.
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
Since ftrace\_enabled = 0, ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() is never
called.
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
Now ftrace\_enabled will be set to true, but still
ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() will not be called, which is not
desired.
Further if we execute the following after this:
# echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
Now since ftrace\_enabled is set it will call
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller(), which causes a kernel warning on
the ARM platform.
On the ARM platform, when ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() is called,
it checks whether the old instruction is a nop or not. If it's not a nop,
then it returns an error. If it is a nop then it replaces instruction at
that address with a branch to ftrace\_graph\_caller.
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() behaves just the opposite. Therefore,
if generic ftrace code ever calls either ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller()
or ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() consecutively two times in a row,
then it will return an error, which will cause the generic ftrace code to
raise a warning.
Note, x86 does not have an issue with this because the architecture
specific code for ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() and
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() does not check the previous state,
and calling either of these functions twice in a row has no ill effect.

ftrace: Clear REGS\_EN and TRAMP\_EN flags on disabling record via sysctl
commit b24d443b8f17d9776f5fc1f6c780a0a21eb02913 upstream.
When /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled is set to zero, all function
tracing is disabled. But the records that represent the functions
still hold information about the ftrace\_ops that are hooked to them.
ftrace\_ops may request "REGS" (have a full set of pt\_regs passed to
the callback), or "TRAMP" (the ops has its own trampoline to use).
When the record is updated to represent the state of the ops hooked
to it, it sets "REGS\_EN" and/or "TRAMP\_EN" to state that the callback
points to the correct trampoline (REGS has its own trampoline).
When ftrace\_enabled is set to zero, all ftrace locations are a nop,
so they do not point to any trampoline. But the \_EN flags are still
set. This can cause the accounting to go wrong when ftrace\_enabled
is cleared and an ops that has a trampoline is registered or unregistered.
For example, the following will cause ftrace to crash:
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
As function\_graph uses a trampoline, when ftrace\_enabled is set to zero
the updates to the record are not done. When enabling function\_graph
again, the record will still have the TRAMP\_EN flag set, and it will
look for an op that has a trampoline other than the function\_graph
ops, and fail to find one.

The 8250\_dw i/o accessors try to write a console error message if the
LCR workaround was unsuccessful. When the port->lock is already held
(eg., when called from serial8250\_set\_termios()), this deadlocks.
Make the error message a FIXME until a general solution is devised.

drm/radeon: drop ttm two ended allocation
commit a239118a24b3bf9089751068e431dfb63dc4168b upstream.
radeon\_bo\_create() calls radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
before ttm\_bo\_init() is called. radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
uses the ttm bo size to determine when to select top down
allocation but since the ttm bo is not initialized yet the
check is always false. It only took effect when buffers
were validated later. It also seemed to regress suspend
and resume on some systems possibly due to it not
taking effect in radeon\_bo\_create().
radeon\_bo\_create() and radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
need to be reworked substantially for this to be optimally
effective. Re-enable it at that point.

arm64: Invalidate the TLB corresponding to intermediate page table levels
commit 285994a62c80f1d72c6924282bcb59608098d5ec upstream.
The ARM architecture allows the caching of intermediate page table
levels and page table freeing requires a sequence like:
pmd\_clear()
TLB invalidation
pte page freeing
With commit 5e5f6dc10546 (arm64: mm: enable HAVE\_RCU\_TABLE\_FREE logic),
the page table freeing batching was moved from tlb\_remove\_page() to
tlb\_remove\_table(). The former takes care of TLB invalidation as this is
also shared with pte clearing and page cache page freeing. The latter,
however, does not invalidate the TLBs for intermediate page table levels
as it probably relies on the architecture code to do it if required.
When the mm->mm\_users < 2, tlb\_remove\_table() does not do any batching
and page table pages are freed before tlb\_finish\_mmu() which performs
the actual TLB invalidation.
This patch introduces \_\_tlb\_flush\_pgtable() for arm64 and calls it from
the {pte,pmd,pud}\_free\_tlb() directly without relying on deferred page
table freeing.

net: compat: Update get\_compat\_msghdr() to match copy\_msghdr\_from\_user() behaviour
[ Upstream commit 91edd096e224941131f896b86838b1e59553696a ]
Commit db31c55a6fb2 (net: clamp ->msg\_namelen instead of returning an
error) introduced the clamping of msg\_namelen when the unsigned value
was larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage). This caused a
msg\_namelen of -1 to be valid. The native code was subsequently fixed by
commit dbb490b96584 (net: socket: error on a negative msg\_namelen).
In addition, the native code sets msg\_namelen to 0 when msg\_name is
NULL. This was done in commit (6a2a2b3ae075 net:socket: set msg\_namelen
to 0 if msg\_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland) and
subsequently updated by 08adb7dabd48 (fold verify\_iovec() into
copy\_msghdr\_from\_user()).
This patch brings the get\_compat\_msghdr() in line with
copy\_msghdr\_from\_user().

MSG\_PEEK isn't passed to ->recvmsg() via msg->msg\_flags; as the matter of
fact, neither the kernel users of rxrpc, nor the syscalls ever set that bit
in there. It gets passed via flags; in fact, another such check in the same
function is done correctly - as flags & MSG\_PEEK.
It had been that way (effectively disabled) for 8 years, though, so the patch
needs beating up - that case had never been tested. If it is correct, it's
-stable fodder.

rds: avoid potential stack overflow
[ Upstream commit f862e07cf95d5b62a5fc5e981dd7d0dbaf33a501 ]
The rds\_iw\_update\_cm\_id function stores a large 'struct rds\_sock' object
on the stack in order to pass a pair of addresses. This happens to just
fit withint the 1024 byte stack size warning limit on x86, but just
exceed that limit on ARM, which gives us this warning:
net/rds/iw\_rdma.c:200:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
As the use of this large variable is basically bogus, we can rearrange
the code to not do that. Instead of passing an rds socket into
rds\_iw\_get\_device, we now just pass the two addresses that we have
available in rds\_iw\_update\_cm\_id, and we change rds\_iw\_get\_mr accordingly,
to create two address structures on the stack there.

net: sysctl\_net\_core: check SNDBUF and RCVBUF for min length

sysctl has sysctl.net.core.rmem\_\*/wmem\_\* parameters which can be
set to incorrect values. Given that 'struct sk\_buff' allocates from
rcvbuf, incorrectly set buffer length could result to memory
allocation failures. For example, set them as follows:

net.core.wmem\_default = 64
# sysctl net.core.wmem\_default=64
net.core.wmem\_default = 64
# ping localhost -s 1024 -i 0 > /dev/null
This could result to the following failure:

connection with an increase of snd\_cwnd\_cnt, or increase snd\_cwnd, but
not both, resulting in cwnd increasing by 1 packet on at most every
alternate invocation of tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai().
Although the commit correctly implemented the CUBIC algorithm, which
can increase cwnd by as much as 1 packet per 1 packet ACKed (2x per
RTT), in practice that could be too aggressive: in tests on network
paths with small buffers, YouTube server retransmission rates nearly
doubled.
This commit restores CUBIC to a maximum cwnd growth rate of 1 packet
per 2 packets ACKed (1.5x per RTT). In YouTube tests this restored
retransmit rates to low levels.
Testing: This patch has been tested in datacenter netperf transfers
and live youtube.com and google.com servers.

tcp: fix tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai() credit accumulation bug with decreases in w
[ Upstream commit 9949afa42be0b76f5832db112ce51bb6b35b2abb ]
The recent change to tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai() to handle stretch ACKs
introduced a bug where snd\_cwnd\_cnt could accumulate a very large
value while w was large, and then if w was reduced snd\_cwnd could be
incremented by a large delta, leading to a large burst and high packet
loss. This was tickled when CUBIC's bictcp\_update() sets "ca->cnt =
100 \* cwnd".
This bug crept in while preparing the upstream version of
814d488c6126.
Testing: This patch has been tested in datacenter netperf transfers
and live youtube.com and google.com servers.

net: fec: fix receive VLAN CTAG HW acceleration issue
[ Upstream commit af5cbc9822f6bbe399925760a4d5ee82c21f258c ]
The current driver support receive VLAN CTAG HW acceleration feature
(NETIF\_F\_HW\_VLAN\_CTAG\_RX) through software simulation. There calls the
api .skb\_copy\_to\_linear\_data\_offset() to skip the VLAN tag, but there
have overlap between the two memory data point range. The patch just fix
the issue.
V2:
Michael Grzeschik suggest to use memmove() instead of skb\_copy\_to\_linear\_data\_offset().

net\_sched: fix struct tc\_u\_hnode layout in u32
[ Upstream commit 5778d39d070b4ac5f889928175b7f2d53ae7504e ]
We dynamically allocate divisor+1 entries for ->ht[] in tc\_u\_hnode:
ht = kzalloc(sizeof(\*ht) + divisor\*sizeof(void \*), GFP\_KERNEL);
So ->ht is supposed to be the last field of this struct, however
this is broken, since an rcu head is appended after it.

sparc64: Fix several bugs in memmove().
[ Upstream commit 2077cef4d5c29cf886192ec32066f783d6a80db8 ]
Firstly, handle zero length calls properly. Believe it or not there
are a few of these happening during early boot.
Next, we can't just drop to a memcpy() call in the forward copy case
where dst <= src. The reason is that the cache initializing stores
used in the Niagara memcpy() implementations can end up clearing out
cache lines before we've sourced their original contents completely.
For example, considering NG4memcpy, the main unrolled loop begins like
this:
load src + 0x00
load src + 0x08
load src + 0x10
load src + 0x18
load src + 0x20
store dst + 0x00
Assume dst is 64 byte aligned and let's say that dst is src - 8 for
this memcpy() call. That store at the end there is the one to the
first line in the cache line, thus clearing the whole line, which thus
clobbers "src + 0x28" before it even gets loaded.
To avoid this, just fall through to a simple copy only mildly
optimized for the case where src and dst are 8 byte aligned and the
length is a multiple of 8 as well. We could get fancy and call
GENmemcpy() but this is good enough for how this thing is actually
used.

sparc: Touch NMI watchdog when walking cpus and calling printk

With the increase in number of CPUs calls to functions that dump
output to console (e.g., arch\_trigger\_all\_cpu\_backtrace) can take
a long time to complete. If IRQs are disabled eventually the NMI
watchdog kicks in and creates more havoc. Avoid by telling the NMI
watchdog everything is ok.

sparc: perf: Make counting mode actually work
[ Upstream commit d51291cb8f32bfae6b331e1838651f3ddefa73a5 ]
Currently perf-stat (aka, counting mode) does not work:
$ perf stat ls
...
Performance counter stats for 'ls':
1.585665 task-clock (msec) # 0.580 CPUs utilized
24 context-switches # 0.015 M/sec

0.002735100 seconds time elapsed
The reason is that state is never reset (stays with PERF\_HES\_UPTODATE set).
Add a call to sparc\_pmu\_enable\_event during the added\_event handling.
Clean up the encoding since pmu\_start calls sparc\_pmu\_enable\_event which
does the same. Passing PERF\_EF\_RELOAD to sparc\_pmu\_start means the call
to sparc\_perf\_event\_set\_period can be removed as well.

sparc: semtimedop() unreachable due to comparison error
[ Upstream commit 53eb2516972b8c4628651dfcb926cb9ef8b2864a ]
A bug was reported that the semtimedop() system call was always
failing eith ENOSYS.
Since SEMCTL is defined as 3, and SEMTIMEDOP is defined as 4,
the comparison "call <= SEMCTL" will always prevent SEMTIMEDOP
from getting through to the semaphore ops switch statement.
This is corrected by changing the comparison to "call <= SEMTIMEDOP".
