- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability allowing remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. On systems where users have administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit these vulnerabilities or leverage compromised websites. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically through a link in an email or instant message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website and convince a user to visit it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
