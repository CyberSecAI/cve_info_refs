Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-2791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The WPML (WordPress Multilingual) plugin had multiple vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input validation, access control, and nonce checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The plugin used the HTTP Referer header to determine the current language. The parsed language code was not validated or SQL-escaped before being used in a database query.
    *   **Location:** Specifically in the `wp-link-ajax` action.

2.  **Page/Post/Menu Deletion:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The "menu sync" functionality lacked access control.
    *   **Location:** `sitepress-multilingual-cms/menu/menus-sync.php`

3.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The "reminder popup" code did not check for login status or nonce, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Location:**  `icl_action=reminder_popup`

4.  **Unauthenticated Administrative Functions:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The plugin used a flawed nonce check allowing an attacker with a valid nonce from any plugin to bypass authentication checks and execute administrative functions by using POST parameters.
    *   **Location:** AJAX actions intended for administrators.

5.  **Reflected XSS via HTTP Referer:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The plugin produced HTML output from the HTTP Referer header for the `sample-permalink` action without sanitization, leading to a reflected XSS.
    *   **Location:** `action=sample-permalink`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  An attacker could read any data from the WordPress database and other accessible databases, including user details and password hashes.
*   **Page/Post/Menu Deletion:** An attacker could delete posts, pages, and menus, effectively removing website content.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, potentially leading to server-side compromise if an administrator is targeted.
*   **Unauthenticated Administrative Functions:**  An attacker could execute arbitrary administrative actions, potentially manipulating or destroying data, including reading server-side files or executing PHP code.
*   **Reflected XSS via HTTP Referer:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the page, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Crafted HTTP Referer headers in POST requests to `wp-link-ajax`.
*   **Page/Post/Menu Deletion:**  Submitting crafted POST requests to `sitepress-multilingual-cms/menu/menus-sync.php`.
*  **Reflected XSS:** Directing users to URLs with crafted javascript in `icl_action=reminder_popup`.
*   **Unauthenticated Administrative Functions:** Using a valid nonce and crafted POST requests to execute administrator AJAX actions.
*   **Reflected XSS via HTTP Referer:**  Crafted HTTP Referer headers when posting to  `action=sample-permalink`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** No authentication needed.
*   **Page/Post/Menu Deletion:** No authentication needed.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  Requires user interaction to visit a malicious URL. If an administrator is targeted, can lead to more severe server-side compromise.
*   **Unauthenticated Administrative Functions:** Requires a valid nonce generated by the target WordPress site and ability to craft and send POST requests.
*  **Reflected XSS via HTTP Referer:**  Requires user interaction to submit a specially crafted referer through a form.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Jouko Pynnonen of Klikki Oy during research within the Facebook bug bounty program.
*   The vendor (WPML) was notified, and a patch was released in version 3.1.9, followed by 3.1.9.1 to fix issues introduced by the initial patch.
*   The vendor initially withheld specific details of the vulnerabilities to give users time to update, sparking criticism from users who wanted more immediate information for mitigation.
