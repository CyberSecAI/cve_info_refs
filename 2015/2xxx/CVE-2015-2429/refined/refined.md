  "CVE-2015-2429": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the handling of registry links. An attacker running code in a low-integrity Internet Explorer process can set a registry link that will be followed by the medium-integrity broker process, which will then reduce the security of the target registry key in such a way that it can be modified by low-integrity Internet Explorer processes.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of registry links by a medium-integrity process invoked by a low-integrity process.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify registry keys that can be used to execute medium-integrity processes from low-integrity Internet Explorer processes, leading to privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker running code in a low-integrity Internet Explorer process can set a registry link that will be followed by a medium-integrity broker process.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to run code in a low-integrity Internet Explorer process."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The specific flaw exists within the IShdocvwBroker::EditWith broker API call. The issue lies in the failure to check for registry symbolic links before recursively traversing the key.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Failure to check for registry symbolic links before recursively traversing a key in the IShdocvwBroker::EditWith broker API call.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read the contents of any key within the HKCU registry hive, bypassing the read restrictions designed into Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM).",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker leverages a vulnerability in the IShdocvwBroker::EditWith broker API call to bypass read restrictions.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have a way to trigger the vulnerable API call, typically via a malicious page or file."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The specific flaw exists within the CIERegistryHelper::SetSingleValue API. When this API is used with a whitelisted registry entry, an attacker can modify privileged registry values via a registry link.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of registry links by the CIERegistryHelper::SetSingleValue API which allows modification of privileged registry values.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the user at medium integrity.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker uses the CIERegistryHelper::SetSingleValue API with a whitelisted registry entry to modify privileged registry values via a registry link.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable API, and to set up a registry link."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege exists in Microsoft Windows when it improperly allows certain registry interactions from within vulnerable sandboxed applications.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper registry interactions from within sandboxed applications.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could improperly interact with the registry and attempt to escape the application sandbox. The attacker could then run programs with the privileges of the logged on user.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted file that would invoke a vulnerable sandboxed application.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted file. Attacker requires the ability to create and deploy the crafted file."
