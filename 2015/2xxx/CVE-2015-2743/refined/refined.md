**Summary of Findings**

Based on the analysis of the provided content, CVE-2015-2743 is a privilege escalation vulnerability within the PDF.js component of Mozilla Firefox (and potentially other Mozilla products). The root cause is that internal workers in PDF.js are granted excessive privileges, allowing for exploitation with another vulnerability (SOP bypass) to achieve arbitrary code execution within the scope of the user.

*   **Root Cause**: Excessive privileges granted to internal workers in PDF.js when loading resource:// uris.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:  Improper handling of URL principals for resource:// workers, which can lead to a same origin policy bypass. Incorrect privilege assignment to internal workers.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in a privileged context, potentially leading to a full system compromise if combined with another security flaw to bypass context restrictions.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page that exploits the incorrect privilege assignment and a separate same origin policy bypass.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: A remote attacker can exploit the flaw if the user visits a specifically crafted malicious website and other requirements for exploitation are met.

The provided documents outline the vulnerability and also how different Linux distributions addressed this vulnerability via patches, however, they do not explain all attack details.
