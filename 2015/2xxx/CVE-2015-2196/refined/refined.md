Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `spiderbigcalendar_month` action within the Webdorado Spider Event Calendar WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi), categorized as CWE-89 and A1-Injection in the OWASP Top 10. Specifically, the `cur_page_url` parameter in the `admin-ajax.php` request is vulnerable. The injected SQL query uses a `UNION SELECT` to extract data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and password hashes, which can lead to unauthorized access to the WordPress site.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the WordPress `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a crafted `action` parameter set to `spiderbigcalendar_month`, and a malicious SQL query injected into the `cur_page_url` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site
    *   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, meaning the exploit can be done remotely without any prior access to the WordPress site.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The provided exploit code constructs two URLs: one to retrieve the table name and another to retrieve user credentials.
    *   The exploit uses `UNION SELECT` to inject malicious SQL queries and extract information.
    *   The exploit targets the `cur_page_url` parameter in the `admin-ajax.php` request.
    *   The exploit retrieves the table name by querying `information_schema.tables`, and user credentials by using `GROUP_CONCAT` on the `user_login` and `user_pass` fields.
*   **Vulnerable Component:** WordPress Plugin Webdorado Spider Event Calendar version 1.4.9 and possibly earlier versions.
