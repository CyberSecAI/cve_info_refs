Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2041:

**CVE-2015-2041**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Linux kernel's LLC (Logical Link Control) subsystem exposes certain variables as sysctls using an incorrect data type. Specifically, it uses `int` instead of `long` for timeout entries.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Incorrect data type usage in sysctl table definitions leading to a type mismatch between the data being stored and the sysctl access.
    *  Potential exposure of kernel memory to userspace.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   **Information Leak**: On a 64-bit kernel, reading these sysctl entries using the incorrect type can cause an information leak. Kernel memory beyond the allocated space may be exposed to user space
    *   **Privilege Escalation**: On a 64-bit kernel, a process with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
   *   The incorrect data types may result in a crash.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Local access**: A local user with the ability to read system settings.
    *   **CAP_NET_ADMIN**: A local process with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
    *   Rapid series of syscalls related to sockets.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   Ability to read sysctl entries (which would usually require some form of privilege).
    * On some systems, the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability

**Technical Details from the Content**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the kernel reads the `llc2_timeout_table` sysctl entries.
*   The entries are defined as `sizeof(int)`, but the actual data is larger, causing the kernel to leak memory when accessed.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernels before 3.19, 3.18.2 and 4.1.6.
*   The issue affects x86_64 architecture.
*   SUSE indicates that this issue only affects openSUSE 13.2 and openSUSE Tumbleweed (201508).
*   The vulnerability is fixed in the Linux Kernel 3.12.38, which means  SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 is fixed with current updates.
*   SUSE also indicates that they no longer fix all CVE's in the Linux Kernel, and instead will mark some classes of bugs as wontfix.

**Affected Systems**

*   Linux kernel before 3.19, 3.18.2, and 4.1.6
*  openSUSE 13.2 and openSUSE Tumbleweed (201508)
*  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 LTSS EXTREME CORE
*  Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10, 12.04
* Systems that use the Linux kernel's `llc2_timeout_table`.

**Mitigation**

*   Applying security patches provided by distributions which are mentioned in the above advisories.

In summary, CVE-2015-2041 involves a local privilege escalation and information disclosure vulnerability due to an incorrect data type in sysctl table in the Linux kernel. It requires local access and the ability to read system information via sysctl or related syscalls to exploit. The impact includes system crashes, sensitive data leaks, and possible privilege escalation with certain capabilities.
