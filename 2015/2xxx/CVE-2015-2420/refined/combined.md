## Vulnerability Information

## System Center Operations Manager Web Console XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2420

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft System Center Operations Manager that is caused by the improper validation of input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script into the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected website on behalf of the targeted user.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit an affected website by way of a specially crafted URL. This can be done through any medium that can contain URL web links that are controlled by the attacker, such as a link in an email, a link on a website, or a redirect on a website. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit a website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger message that directs them to the affected website by way of a specially crafted URL.

Users who are authorized to access System Center Operations Manager web consoles are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that System Center Operations Manager accepts input.
