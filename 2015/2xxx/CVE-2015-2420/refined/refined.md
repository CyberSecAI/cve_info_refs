- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of input within the System Center Operations Manager web console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject a client-side script into the user's browser. This script could:
    - Spoof content on the affected website.
    - Disclose sensitive information.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the targeted user.
    - Cause elevation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Convincing a user to visit a malicious website via a specially crafted URL.
    - Utilizing URL web links in various mediums controlled by the attacker (email, websites, redirects).
    - Exploiting compromised websites and sites accepting user-provided content/ads that host the crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link to trigger the vulnerability, typically through social engineering techniques.
    - The attacker does not need to have compromised the System Center Operations Manager server.
    - Access to a web link injection point, or the ability to host malicious content on a website.
