The provided content is related to CVE-2015-2360.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) failing to properly free memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory management in win32k.sys.
- Use-after-free condition due to failure to properly free memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of another user. If that user has elevated rights, the attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights, leading to elevation of privilege.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the targeted system.
- An attacker would need to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability and increase privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated and able to log on to the system locally.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code/applications on the targeted system.
