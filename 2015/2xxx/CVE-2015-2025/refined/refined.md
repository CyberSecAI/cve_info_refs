Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2025:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the failure to set the "secure" flag for the session cookie when using SSL mode in IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The lack of the secure flag on session cookies allows them to be transmitted over non-HTTPS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can intercept the cookie and gain access to sensitive information, potentially including access to statistics data on grid usage and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The primary attack vector is through the interception of HTTP traffic where the session cookie is transmitted without the secure flag enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the vulnerable WebSphere eXtreme Scale server. This could be on the same network or through a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **HTTP Session:** The attacker needs to intercept the session during its transmission within an HTTP session.
*   **No Authentication Required for initial attack:** The initial cookie capture does not require the attacker to be authenticated.
