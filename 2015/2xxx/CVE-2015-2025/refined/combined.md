  CVEID: CVE-2015-2025
  DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale could allow a remote
  attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the
  failure to set the secure flag for the session cookie in SSL
  mode. By intercepting its transmission within an HTTP session,
  an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to capture the
  cookie and obtain sensitive information.
