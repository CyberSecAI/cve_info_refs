Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how `WebChannel.jsm` in Mozilla Firefox handles message traffic when a trusted page is hosted within an `<iframe>` on an untrusted page. The untrusted page can intercept webchannel responses meant for the trusted page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing Same Origin Policy:** The core weakness is the circumvention of the Same Origin Policy, allowing an untrusted page to access data intended for a trusted page.
*   **Inadequate iframe Handling:** The code inadequately manages the context of webchannel messages when they are sent from within an iframe. The messages are not correctly routed or restricted based on the origin of the iframe.
*   **Incorrect target handling:** When a message is sent, the target of the message and the original sender's location may be different, leading to unintended delivery.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can potentially intercept sensitive information that is exchanged via webchannel messages. This could include personal data, account details, or other confidential information that is meant to be private to the trusted page.
*   **Bypass Origin Restrictions:** An attacker could bypass origin restrictions and thus exploit other potential vulnerabilities on the trusted site.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By intercepting communications between the trusted page and its server, an attacker might gain further insight into the application and potentially execute other, more severe exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious page.
*   **Iframe:** The malicious page embeds a trusted page within an `<iframe>`.
*   **Webchannel Message Interception:** The attacker uses the vulnerability to intercept webchannel messages that are sent by the trusted page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote location.
*   **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a website that can load a vulnerable trusted page inside an iframe.
*   **Understanding of Webchannel:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of how WebChannel messages work to construct the attack.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or user-level access to the victim's system.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to how Firefox handles webchannel messages, so it's a browser-specific issue.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Firefox 34 when webchannels for Firefox Accounts were implemented.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 38, Firefox OS 2.2, and SeaMonkey 2.35, according to Mozilla's security advisory.
*   Several SUSE security advisories and openSUSE updates address the vulnerability.
*   Patches were developed to ensure the webchannel response is only delivered to the initiating window, and that the initiating window has not been redirected to another origin.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the "sender" object passed to the channel listener includes not only the message sender, but also the event target CPOW so that a check on the correct target can be performed.
*   The test cases developed included tests for cross-origin communication within iframes.

In summary, CVE-2015-2718 is a significant vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy and intercept sensitive information. The exploit requires an attacker to host a malicious website, but it does not require any special privileges or user-level access, making it a relatively easy exploit for attackers to deploy against vulnerable users.
