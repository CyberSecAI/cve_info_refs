- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect application of access control list (ACL) configuration settings within Windows Hyper-V.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Security Feature Bypass due to Hyper-V not applying ACL settings correctly.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially cause Hyper-V to allow unintended network traffic, bypassing security features.
- **Attack vectors**: Running a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run a specially crafted application on a system with the Hyper-V role enabled.
