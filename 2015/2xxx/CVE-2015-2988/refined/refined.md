Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Rakuten Card App for iOS fails to properly verify SSL server certificates. This means that the app does not validate the authenticity of the server it's communicating with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation. This allows the app to connect to potentially malicious servers without raising any alerts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communication between the app and the legitimate server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information being transmitted (e.g., credit card details, personal data).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the app and the server. This could be achieved by setting up a malicious Wi-Fi access point or compromising a network router.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Affected Products**
- Rakuten card App for iOS versions 5.2.0 to 5.2.4
