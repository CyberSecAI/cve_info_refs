Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a deserialization issue in the PJSIP PJSUA2 Android SDK. A `Serializable` class within the SDK contains a `finalize` method that calls a native function, passing an attacker-controlled pointer as an argument. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the serialized data during deserialization. An attacker can provide a crafted serialized object containing a malicious pointer.
- **Non-Transient Native Pointer:** The `Serializable` class in question has a member that is a native pointer, which is not marked as `transient`. This allows it to be serialized and subsequently controlled by an attacker during deserialization.
- **`finalize` Method Vulnerability:** The `finalize` method in the class accesses the deserialized native pointer. The attacker-controlled pointer is then used in a call to a native function, which leads to code execution.
- **SWIG Generated Code Vulnerability**: The use of SWIG to connect C/C++ code to Java can introduce vulnerabilities if developers are not careful about the configuration, particularly in how they define the Java classes that are wrapping C++ objects. Specifically if the generated Java wrapper class for a C++ object that contains a native pointer implements `Serializable` (either directly, or indirectly by extending a `Serializable` class) and doesn't mark the native pointer as transient, it introduces the possibility of arbitrary code execution via the finalize method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the native pointer, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or service using the vulnerable PJSIP library.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In the Android context, this could lead to privilege escalation if the vulnerable code runs in a process with higher privileges (e.g. `system_server`), potentially allowing attackers to bypass security mechanisms.
- **System Compromise:** The vulnerability enables the attacker to gain control of the device, replacing existing apps, changing SELinux policy, and loading arbitrary kernel modules.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The vulnerability is exploited through Android's IPC mechanism, specifically by crafting a malicious `Bundle` object that includes the vulnerable `Serializable` object.
- **Intent Extras:** The attacker can inject the malicious object into an `Intent`'s extras, which are then deserialized by the receiving application.
- **Deserialization Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when a vulnerable `Bundle` is touched or used by an application, leading to automatic deserialization and instantiation of the malicious object.
- **writeReplace method**: Alternatively, the attacker can rely on the writeReplace method which is called during serialization of the object, leading to a native function call and code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Malicious Intents:** The attacker must be able to send crafted intents or messages containing the malicious serialized data to the target application or service.
- **Understanding of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable class and its members to craft the malicious serialized data.
- **Local Application Context or Ability to Intercept IPC:** An attacker could be a malicious application or a compromised application that intercepts and modifies IPC messages to insert the malicious serialized object into the data stream.
