## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3080790)

Published: August 11, 2015 | Updated: October 13, 2015

**Version:** 3.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Correcting how Office handles files in memory
* Improving, in conjunction with the updates for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Windows, how Microsoft Office programs are executed from Internet Explorer
* Correcting how Office validates Office templates prior to use
* Correcting how Office handles integer bounds checking

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3080790](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3080790).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then, for example, take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

## Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2466

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly validate templates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted template file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website or file share (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website or file share. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

Alternatively, an attacker could launch a Ã¢ÂÂMan-in-the-middleÃ¢ÂÂ attack (intercept the traffic between source and destination) and modify the template contents to include malicious code.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office validates office templates prior to use.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Microsoft Office Integer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2470

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Office decreases an integer value beyond its intended minimum value. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles integer bounds checking.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

In this crash eax is coming from the 3rd argument passed into the function at 0x312ab5e7. It is pointing to valid memory allocated with the following call stack:

0:000> !heap -p -a 0x17dd0f5b
    address 17dd0f5b found in
    _DPH_HEAP_ROOT @ 1151000
    in busy allocation (  DPH_HEAP_BLOCK:         UserAddr         UserSize -         VirtAddr         VirtSize)
                                170a8400:         17dd0f58               a8 -         17dd0000             2000

    312f79d2 wwlib!FMain+0x000b341b
    312f727e wwlib!FMain+0x000b2cc7

The indexes being pushed onto the stack eax +0xB8, +0xB0, +0xB4, and +0xAC push the value beyond the allocated size of a8. With pageheap enabled this causes a fault at the first push. This is an exploitable bug because the function at 0x312ab34a uses these values in memory write operations:

0:000> uf 312ab34a
wwlib!FMain+0x66d93:
312ab34a 55              push    ebp
312ab34b 8bec            mov     ebp,esp
312ab34d 8b4508          mov     eax,dword ptr [ebp+8]
312ab350 8b4d0c          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp+0Ch]
312ab353 8b5510          mov     edx,dword ptr [ebp+10h]
=> 312ab356 2908            sub     dword ptr [eax],ecx
=> 312ab358 015008          add     dword ptr [eax+8],edx
312ab35b 8b4d14          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp+14h]
312ab35e 8b5518          mov     edx,dword ptr [ebp+18h]
=> 312ab361 294804          sub     dword ptr [eax+4],ecx
=> 312ab364 01500c          add     dword ptr [eax+0Ch],edx
312ab367 5d              pop     ebp
312ab368 c21400          ret     14h

At attacker may control these values by grooming memory so that he or she controls the memory after the a8 sized chunk. This can lead to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. The root cause of this bug suggestive of a type confusion vulnerability earlier in the call stack but this has not been determined with certainty.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
