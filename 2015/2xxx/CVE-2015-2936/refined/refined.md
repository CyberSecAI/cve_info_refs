Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of the PBKDF2 algorithm for password hashing, which is the default since MediaWiki 1.24. This algorithm is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks when extremely long passwords are used as input.  The excessive computation required by PBKDF2 with very long passwords can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a DoS caused by the computational intensity of PBKDF2 when handling excessively long passwords. This can lead to the server being overwhelmed and unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack can result in a DoS condition, potentially rendering the MediaWiki instance unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login form, where an attacker provides an extremely long password. This could be done either programmatically via the API or manually.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send login requests to the MediaWiki instance. This can be accomplished remotely, and does not require any existing credentials or elevated permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified both internally by a MediaWiki review and by iSEC Partners (iSEC-WMF1214-1).
- The fix was implemented by limiting the maximum length of passwords accepted, similar to the fix implemented by WordPress.
- The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.24.2, 1.23.9, and 1.19.24.
- The patch included updates to several files, such as `User.php` and `SpecialUserLogin.php`.

The information found in the provided documents gives a good picture of how the vulnerability was identified, the impact of the vulnerability, how it was fixed, and what software was affected.
