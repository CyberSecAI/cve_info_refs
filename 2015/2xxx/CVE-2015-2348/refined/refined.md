**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a NUL byte injection vulnerability in the `move_uploaded_file()` function within PHP. Specifically, the function fails to properly handle file names containing a NULL character (`\x00`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **NUL byte injection:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `move_uploaded_file()` function does not properly handle filenames containing a NULL character. When a NULL byte is present in the target path of this function, it truncates the path at that point, causing the file to be moved to an unintended location.
    *   **Incomplete Fix:**  The vulnerability is described as arising from an "incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243," suggesting that a previous attempt to address a similar issue was not fully effective and introduced a regression in PHP versions 5.4+.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Bypass Extension Restrictions:** By injecting a NULL byte, a remote attacker can manipulate the target file path, potentially bypassing intended extension restrictions (e.g., moving a file with a `.php\x00.jpg` name to a location where it is treated as a `.php` file) and file system access controls.
    *    **Arbitrary Code Execution** An attacker could upload a php script with a crafted name which will then be treated as php code which can lead to RCE
    *   **Unexpected File Names:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to create files with unexpected names, which can be a part of various types of attacks.
    *   **Access to Unexpected Files**: The injected NULL character allows scripts to access files outside of intended directories, which could result in sensitive files being exposed
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via a crafted second argument to the `move_uploaded_file()` function.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control the target path argument of the `move_uploaded_file()` function (e.g. via web form upload).

**4. Summary**

CVE-2015-2348 describes a NUL byte injection vulnerability in PHP's `move_uploaded_file()` function. This flaw allows remote attackers to bypass extension restrictions and intended file system access controls by injecting a NULL character into the filename, potentially leading to unexpected file creation and RCE. The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.4.39, 5.5.23, and 5.6.7. The vulnerability results from a regression of a fix for a prior CVE. Patches for this have been created for several distros including RedHat and openSUSE, and fixes were incorporated into php itself in versions 5.4.39, 5.5.23 and 5.6.7.
