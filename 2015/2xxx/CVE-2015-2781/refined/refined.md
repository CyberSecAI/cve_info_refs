Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2781

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `hotspotlogin.cgi` script within the HotExBilling Manager software. Specifically, the `reply` parameter is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users by manipulating the `reply` parameter in the `hotspotlogin.cgi` script.
* **Missing HttpOnly Flag:** The report mentions that the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on cookies allows an attacker to potentially steal cookies through a successful XSS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Client-Side Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser. This code can be used for various malicious purposes.
* **Cookie Stealing:**  An attacker could steal session cookies (e.g., PHPSESSID) due to the missing HttpOnly flag.
* **Admin Account Hijacking:** If an admin's cookie is compromised, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the admin portal. This could lead to:
    *   Full control of the HotEx device.
    *   Manipulation of guest accounts.
    *   Access to payment details.
*   **Compromise of user accounts:** The XSS vulnerability can allow malicious redirection of legitimate user requests to attacker controlled sites allowing for phishing attacks and potential account hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
* **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the injected script in the `reply` parameter and sends it to the target users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **No special capabilities/position** are needed. Any attacker capable of sending a crafted URL would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
* **Vulnerable Module:** `hotspotlogin.cgi`
* **Vulnerable Parameter:** `reply`
* **Example of Exploitation:**
    ```
