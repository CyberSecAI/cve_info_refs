When these CVEs are published on the cve.mitre.org web site, there may
be further information about which specific attacks are characterized
with CSRF as the only primary vulnerability, and which specific
attacks are characterized otherwise (e.g., a primary vulnerability of
XSS).

The ability of one admin account to enter XSS intentionally, in order
to compromise another equivalent admin account, does not inherently
cross privilege boundaries and is not inherently eligible for a CVE
ID. However, if the vendor specifically announces that a
"vulnerability" fix has been made for such an issue, MITRE typically
defers to the vendor's judgment that the issue is actually a violation
of the product's security policy, and therefore is within the scope of
CVE. The existence of a vendor commit with a fix, however, does not
(by itself) establish a security policy.
