- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded credentials exist within the Sierra Wireless GX, ES, and LS gateway devices running ALEOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Use of hard-coded passwords (CWE-259).
    - Multiple hard-coded accounts with root privileges.
    - Enabled by default, allowing access via telnet or SSH in ALEOS versions 4.3.4 and earlier.
    - Although remote access is disabled by default in versions 4.3.5 to 4.4.1, the accounts still exist and are enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain full control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote access via telnet or SSH (for versions 4.3.4 and earlier).
    - Exploitation of the enabled but remotely disabled accounts in versions 4.3.5 to 4.4.1
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker. The attacker needs to be able to reach the device over the network, and be able to use telnet or SSH to log in.
