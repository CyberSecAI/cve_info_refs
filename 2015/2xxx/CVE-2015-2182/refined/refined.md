Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2182:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root Cause:** The Zeuscart v.4 application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters used in the `index.php` file, specifically `search`, `schltr`, and `brand`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in the `search`, `schltr`, and `brand` parameters of `index.php`.
    *   The application does not sanitize or encode user-provided input before reflecting it back in the response.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they visit the crafted link.
    *   This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
    *   The attacker can then trick a user into clicking the malicious link, for example through phishing or social engineering.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click the crafted malicious link.
