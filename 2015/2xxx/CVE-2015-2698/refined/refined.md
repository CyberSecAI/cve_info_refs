{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `iakerb_gss_export_sec_context` function in MIT Kerberos 5 improperly accesses a pointer due to a regression introduced while fixing CVE-2015-2696.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect pointer dereference."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (memory corruption and process crash), and possibly have other unspecified impacts, by interacting with an application that calls the `gss_export_sec_context` function when the context was established using the IAKERB mechanism.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send specially crafted IAKERB packets to an application that uses Kerberos and calls the `gss_export_sec_context` function."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to interact with an application that calls `gss_export_sec_context` with a context established using the IAKERB mechanism.",
