The provided content relates to CVE-2015-2180.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing a command to be executed by the system. Specifically, the `newpass` variable, which contains the user's new password, is used directly within the `exec()` function without any form of escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote Command Execution (RCE) due to the lack of input sanitization when building the command string in the `exec()` function within `plugins/password/drivers/dbmail.php`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The `chgdbmailusers` program is executed with root privileges due to the `setuid(UID)` call, so any command injection will be run as root.
- **Buffer Overflow:** A secondary vulnerability is mentioned, which is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `chgdbmailusers.c` program, specifically within the `strcat()` operations when concatenating the command parameters into the `cmnd` buffer, which is limited to 255 bytes. However, the primary issue is the command execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server with root privileges. This could lead to:
- Complete system compromise
- Data breaches
- Installation of malware
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user. The attacker must:
- Enable the password plugin in the Roundcube configuration.
- Set the password driver to `dbmail`.
- Log into the Roundcube web interface.
- Navigate to Settings -> Password.
- Enter a malicious password containing shell meta-characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Roundcube web interface with the ability to change their password.
- The attacker needs to have the password plugin enabled in the Roundcube configuration.
- The attacker needs the `dbmail` driver to be configured as the password driver.
