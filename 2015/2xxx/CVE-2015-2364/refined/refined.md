- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the Windows graphics component due to its failure to properly process bitmap conversions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper processing of bitmap conversions in the Windows graphics component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate privileges on the targeted system. This can lead to the attacker being able to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be authenticated and have the ability to run applications on the target system.
