## Vulnerabilities in RDP Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3080348)

Published: August 11, 2015 | Updated: December 23, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker first places a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file in the target userâs current working directory and then convinces the user to open a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file or to launch a program that is designed to load a trusted DLL file but instead loads the attackerâs specially crafted DLL file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Window except Windows 10, which is not affected. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) validates certificates and by correcting how RDP loads certain binaries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3080348](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3080348).

## Vulnerability Information

## Remote Desktop Session Host Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2472

A spoofing vulnerability exists when the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) improperly validates certificates during authentication. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could impersonate the client session.

To exploit the vulnerability, in a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack an attacker could generate an untrusted certificate that matches the issuer name and serial number of the trusted certificates. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how RDSH validates certificates.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Remote Desktop Protocol DLL Planting Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2473

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol client improperly handles the loading of certain specially crafted DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to place a specially crafted DLL file in the target userâs current working directory and then convince the user to open a specially crafted RDP file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted RDP file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows RDP client loads certain binaries.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the RDP server service is not enabled on any Windows operating system. Systems that do not have the RDP server service enabled are not at risk.

### Workarounds

The following [workaround](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Remove the .rdp file association**

  **Warning** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Method 1 (Manually edit the system registry):**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click on **RDP.File**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.
  3. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **RDPfile HKCR file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**. This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.
  5. Navigate to the following registry location:

     ```
     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts

     ```
  6. Click on **.rdp**, then click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.
  7. Navigate to the following registry location:

     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Low Rights\ElevationPolicy

     ```
  8. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **HKCU file association registry backup.reg** and then click **Save**.This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  9. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.

  **Method 2 (Use a managed deployment script):**

  1. Create a backup copy of the registry keys by running the following commands:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /e rdpfile_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File
     Regedit.exe /e rdp_HKCU_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp

     ```
  2. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension (e.g. Delete\_rdp\_file\_association.reg):

     ```
     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
     [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\RDP.File]
     [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.rdp]

     ```
  3. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  4. Run the registry script you created in step b on the target machine using the following command:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /s Delete_rdp_file_association.reg

     ```

**Impact of workaround.** Double clicking on a .jnt file will no longer launch journal.exe

**How to undo the workaround**

Restore the registry key by using Regedit to restore the settings you saved in the .REG files.
