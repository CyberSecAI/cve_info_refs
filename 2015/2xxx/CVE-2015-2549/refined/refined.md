- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption in the Windows kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, allowing them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to log on to the affected system and then run a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the affected system.
