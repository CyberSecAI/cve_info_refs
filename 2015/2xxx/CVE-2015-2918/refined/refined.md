Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The OrientDB Studio web management interface does not enforce the same-origin policy in `X-Frame-Options` response headers by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing `X-Frame-Options` header:** The server does not send the `X-Frame-Options` header which is crucial to prevent clickjacking attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Clickjacking:** An attacker can embed the vulnerable OrientDB Studio web interface within a malicious web page (via an iframe). By tricking users into interacting with the embedded interface, the attacker can execute actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Clickjacking attack:** The attacker creates a crafted web page containing a hidden iframe that loads the vulnerable OrientDB Studio interface.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the victim to visit the crafted web page and interact with the interface, unknowingly performing actions in the hidden iframe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be a remote unauthenticated user.
*   **Crafted Web Page:** The attacker needs to host or deliver a malicious webpage.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to trick a user with an active OrientDB session into visiting the malicious page.
