Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate an existing session identifier in IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session Hijacking: The core vulnerability is the lack of proper session invalidation, making it possible for an attacker to take over a user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to another user's session.
- Access to Monitoring Console: This could allow the attacker to read statistics data on grid usage which might expose potentially sensitive information in the grid, according to the general summary of the vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability over a network.
- Network-based: Exploitation occurs through network communication with the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WebSphere eXtreme Scale application remotely.
-  The attacker must be able to exploit the flaw in the session management to take over an active session.
-  The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate the communication to take over the valid session.
