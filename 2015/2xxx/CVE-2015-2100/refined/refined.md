Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow within the `WESPDiscovery.WESPDiscoveryCtrl.1` ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `TCPDiscovery` (or `TCPDiscovery2` in the Control Center version) method of the ActiveX control copies arbitrary data to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Browser Context:** The code execution occurs within the context of the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious page containing the vulnerable ActiveX control or open a malicious file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the target's machine over a network.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create a web page or file that includes the vulnerable ActiveX control and provides the oversized data to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Target must use Internet Explorer and have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed:** The vulnerable control is an ActiveX control, making Internet Explorer the primary attack vector.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory was disclosed without a patch because the vendor did not respond to attempts to report the vulnerability.
- A killbit can be set in the registry to prevent the ActiveX control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer as a mitigation.
- The vulnerability affects both WebGate Control Center and eDVR Manager products.
