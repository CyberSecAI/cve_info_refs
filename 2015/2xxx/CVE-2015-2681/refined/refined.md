      "root_cause": "The ASUS RT-G32 router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `start_apply.htm` page. Specifically, the `next_page`, `group_id`, `action_script`, and `flag` parameters are vulnerable.",

      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a malicious link or webpage. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement or other malicious actions. Also, an attacker can leverage CSRF to change router settings, including the administrator password.",

        "GET request to `/start_apply.htm` with malicious parameters",

Firmware versions 2.0.2.6 and 2.0.3.2 were specifically tested and confirmed to be vulnerable. XSS can be triggered without authorization, and the CSRF vulnerability can change various settings, including the admin password."
