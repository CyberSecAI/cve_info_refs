## Total Commander File Info plugin vulnerable to denial of service via an out-of-bounds read

#### Vulnerability Note VU#813631

Original Release Date: 2015-07-20 | Last Revised: 2015-07-20

---

### Overview

Total Commander's File Info plugin version 2.21 attempts an out-of-bounds read when reading a file carefully crafted by an attacker.

### Description

| [**CWE-125**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)**: Out-of-bounds Read** - CVE-2015-2869  An attacker that can control the contents of certain file types may be able to cause an out-of-bounds read error in Total Commander File Plugin version 2.21 by specifying overly large values of certain properties. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may cause the Total Commander application to unexpectedly terminate.This attack has been noted in at least two different file types due to the software's improper use of the strncmp function.     + COFF Archive Library (.lib) files may be used by specifying overly large values for the 'Size' field of the Archive Member Header or the "Number Of Symbols" field in the 1st Linker Member. + Linear Executable files may be used by specifying overly large values for the "Resource Table Count" field of the LE Header or the "Object" field at offset 0x8 from a "Resource Table Entry".  Out-of-bounds reads may allow remote code execution in some circumstances; the CERT/CC is currently unaware of such an attack on the Total Commander File Info plugin, however. |
| --- |

### Impact

The second half of the vulnerability concerns an attacker who controls the content of a Linear Executable file can cause an out of bounds read by specifying overly large values for the “Resource Table Count” field of the LE Header or the “Object” field at offset 0x8 from a “Resource Table Entry”. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can cause the Total Commander application to unexpectedly terminate.

These vulnerabilities has been tested against FileInfo 2.21 and FileInfo 2.22.
