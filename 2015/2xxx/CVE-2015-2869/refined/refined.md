Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2869

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read error within the Total Commander FileInfo plugin when processing specially crafted files. The plugin fails to properly validate the size of certain fields within file headers, leading to attempts to read memory outside of the allocated buffer. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from improper usage of the `strncmp` function when parsing file headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** The plugin attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of allocated memory buffers. This is due to not properly validating size parameters in the file headers.
*   **Improper use of strncmp:** The software's improper use of the `strncmp` function contributes to the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The plugin doesn't properly validate the size fields in file headers, allowing an attacker to specify overly large values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the Total Commander application to terminate unexpectedly due to the out-of-bounds read error, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. While remote code execution is mentioned as a possibility in some circumstances, this is not confirmed for this particular case with the Total Commander FileInfo plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted files:** The attacker must craft malicious files containing specific file header structures that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Specific file types:** The vulnerability affects the parsing of COFF Archive Library (.lib) and Linear Executable (LE) files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file to the Total Commander application or have the application process a crafted file.
*   The attacker needs detailed knowledge of the targeted file formats (COFF and LE) and the specific fields that trigger the vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
*   The content specifies which fields in the COFF and LE file formats are vulnerable:
    *   For COFF: The 'Size' field of the Archive Member Header or the "Number Of Symbols" field in the 1st Linker Member.
    *   For LE: The "Resource Table Count" field of the LE Header or the "Object" field at offset 0x8 from a "Resource Table Entry".
*   It mentions the specific version of the plugin affected (2.21) and the fixed version (2.22).
*   It acknowledges Cisco TALOS and Marcin Noga for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
*   It highlights that the vulnerability is related to the improper use of the `strncmp` function.
*   The provided CVSS metrics are more informative than a basic description.
