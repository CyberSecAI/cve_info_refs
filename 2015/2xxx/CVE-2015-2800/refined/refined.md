- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The user authentication module in some Huawei switch products does not properly validate user inputs, specifically during the login process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A memory overflow vulnerability exists within the user authentication module.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a device restart (Denial of Service).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user logs in to the device with a specially crafted user name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device and be able to attempt a login.
