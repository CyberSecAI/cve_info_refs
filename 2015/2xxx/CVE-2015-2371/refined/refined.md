- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows Installer service improperly runs custom action scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper execution of custom action scripts in the Windows Installer service allows for elevation of privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could elevate privileges, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must first compromise a user logged on to the target system. Then, they need to find a vulnerable .msi package installed on the target system. Finally, the attacker needs to place specially crafted code on the target system for the vulnerable .msi to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to compromise a user account on the target system and have the ability to place malicious code on the system for execution by a vulnerable .msi package.
