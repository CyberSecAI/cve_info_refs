In that case, we don't know what vulnerability you mean for #2.

Between the unpatched code and the patched code, the only change in
the allocate_cells function is the addition of checks for whether
workbook or workbook->active_sheet is NULL. In the unpatched code, if
either of these were NULL, workbook->active_sheet->rows would result
in a NULL pointer dereference. As far as we know, this outcome is not
typically described as "stack corruption."

If the design of the allocate_cells function was supposed to
anticipate that callers might provide a NULL value for workbook or
workbook->active_sheet, then the unpatched code had a vulnerability in
the allocate_cells function that might loosely be described as a "NULL
pointer dereference vulnerability."

We think you may mean that, in some cases, stack corruption has
occurred because of invalid workbook dimensions before the
allocate_cells function is called. In some or all of these cases, a
side effect of the stack corruption is that either workbook or
workbook->active_sheet is NULL. The patched code, instead of
preventing the stack corruption (or detecting the stack corruption
before calling allocate_cells), chooses to use these "== NULL" tests
to infer that stack corruption has occurred. Is this correct?

(The concern here is that this would not typically be described as "A
flaw was found in the function allocate_cells()." It might instead be
described as something like "a missed opportunity to use the function
allocate_cells() to address stack corruption elsewhere."

Maybe this is a subtle distinction but it, in general, affects both
the meaning of the CVE and the usefulness of doing some additional
types of security research on the FreeXL code.)

# FreeXL: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201606-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in FreeXL, allowing remote
attackers to executive arbitrary code or cause Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/freexl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

FreeXL is an open source library to extract valid data from within an
Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.

### Description

FreeXLâ€™s shared strings and workbook functions are vulnerable to the
remote execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service. This can be
achieved through specially crafted workbooks from attackers.

### Impact

Remote attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause
Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeXL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-libs/freexl-1.0.1"

```

Package        : freexl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2753 CVE-2015-2754 CVE-2015-2776

Jodie Cunningham discovered multiple vulnerabilities in freexl, a
library to read Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which might result in
denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Excel
file is opened.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.0b-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.0.0g-1+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.0g-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your freexl packages.

Subject: CVE Request: Multiple vulnerabilities in freexl 1.0.0g

Hi,

I found multiple issues in the library FreeXL 1.0.0g.
The vendor has corrected these issues in FreeXL 1.0.1 , and a diff for
the four issues is available here:
<https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/freexl/fdiff?v1=2e167b337481dda3&v2=61618ce51a9b0c15&sbs=1>

FreeXL 1.0.1 itself has been released here:
<http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/freexl-1.0.1.tar.gz>

To reproduce:
./test_xl $reproducer

#1:  A flaw was found in the way FreeXL reads sectors from the input
file.  A specially crafted file could possibly result in stack
corruption near freexl.c:3752.

Reproducer: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/3htzndywvtmomlx/freexl_9f74b0e8?dl=0>

#2: A flaw was found in the function allocate_cells(). A specially
crafted file with invalid workbook dimensions could possibly result in
stack corruption near freexl.c:1074

Reproducer: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/dcnbbntf7lp03yn/freexl_c9be2aa7?dl=0>

#3: A flaw was found in the way FreeXL handles a premature EOF. A
specially crafted input file could possibly result in stack corruption
near freexl.c:1131

Reproducer: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/66srfory903w6cl/freexl_d7273f72?dl=0>

#4: FreeXL 1.0.0g did not properly check requests for workbook memory
allocation. A specially crafted input file could cause a Denial of
Service, or possibly write onto the stack.

Reproducer (ulimit -Sv 128000):
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/gh61gzaf8jj30hj/freexl_6889d18b?dl=0>

Subject: Re: CVE Request: Multiple vulnerabilities in freexl 1.0.0g

Firstly, a correction to my earlier statement about the fixed release:
1.0.0i is the first release to include the patch.

Yes

I don't believe so. It looks like these are initialized as NULL, and
if they are still NULL at this point in execution then we assume the
input file was malformed and exit with the appropriate return code.

This vulnerability is related to the missing "> 1024 * 1024" test in
the parse_SST function.  The workbook could be crafted with a bad
shared strings table that could use up an excessive amount of memory
resources on the target system. gdb/exploitable.py also indicated
DestAvNearNull at the time of the crash.

The retcode change should benefit #3 and #4, but I don't know that it
has any role at all in preventing the vulnerabilities.

V/R,
-Jodie
