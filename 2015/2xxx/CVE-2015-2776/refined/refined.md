Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2776:

**CVE Description:**
The official CVE description is not available. However, based on the provided context, it relates to a vulnerability in FreeXL versions prior to 1.0.1 (or 1.0.0i), where a specially crafted Excel file could lead to a denial of service or potentially a stack corruption.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `parse_SST` function within FreeXL, specifically, the lack of a check on the size of the shared strings table.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Missing Size Check:** The `parse_SST` function does not properly validate the size of the shared string table (SST) in the Excel file. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large number of shared strings.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** When processing the crafted file, FreeXL allocates memory based on the attacker-controlled size from the SST.  This excessive memory allocation can exhaust available system resources or trigger an out-of-memory condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by forcing FreeXL to allocate large amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and program termination.
- **Possible Stack Corruption:** There is also the potential for a stack corruption, as mentioned in the initial report, although not explicitly specified how this occurs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted Excel (.xls) file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an Excel file.
- **File Delivery:** The attacker needs to get the victim to open the crafted file with a vulnerable version of FreeXL.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `parse_SST` function where the code allocates memory for strings based on a value read from the input file without any proper bounds checking:
   ```c
   workbook->shared_strings.utf8_strings = malloc (sizeof (char **) * workbook->shared_strings.string_count);
   ```
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding the following check before allocating memory:
    ```c
    if (workbook->shared_strings.string_count > 1024 * 1024)
    {
      /* unexpected huge count ... cowardly giving up ... */
      return FREEXL_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY;
    }
   ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is also described as related to missing `> 1024 * 1024` test in the `parse_SST` function.
- The fix includes a check to ensure that the string count is not greater than `1024 * 1024` bytes.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious XLS file with a large string count.
- The `allocate_cells` function initially thought to be involved in this issue is actually related to a different vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2015-2776 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in FreeXL caused by a missing bounds check when parsing shared string tables, leading to excessive memory allocation. An attacker can exploit this by providing a malformed XLS file, potentially causing a denial of service and possibly stack corruption.
