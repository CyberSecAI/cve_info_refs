Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation for URLs, specifically the "//" initial sequence, which is associated with external resources within the Drupal framework. This allowed for open redirect vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: Drupal failed to properly sanitize or validate URLs, specifically those starting with "//", leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- Lack of checks for the special "//" sequence: Drupal did not check for the "//" sequence, which is an indicator for an external resource.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Open Redirect: Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites. This can be used in phishing attacks where users are tricked into visiting a legitimate site only to be redirected to a malicious site to steal credentials or inject malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URL Parameter: Attackers can inject a specially crafted URL with the "//" sequence as an input, leading to the open redirect.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that is processed by the vulnerable Drupal instance. This typically involves the attacker providing the malicious URL as an input through a parameter, which Drupal then uses for redirection. No special privileges or access to the server are needed.
