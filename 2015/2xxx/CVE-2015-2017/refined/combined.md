# Security Bulletin: HTTP response splitting attack in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2017)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server that could allow an HTTP response splitting attack in Channel.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-2017](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2017) IBM WebSphere Application Server is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks.
