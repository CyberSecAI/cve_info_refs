Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2015-2486:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This can corrupt memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory Corruption: Both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are vulnerable to memory corruption issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially Crafted Websites: Attackers can host malicious websites designed to exploit these memory corruption vulnerabilities.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into legitimate websites that accept user-provided content, or advertisements to redirect users to their controlled content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content. This could be through phishing emails/messages containing links to the attacker's website or through malicious attachments.
- The attacker does not have the ability to force users to view the malicious content; user interaction is required.
