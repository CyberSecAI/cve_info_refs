Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2948

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Zenphoto processes user-supplied input that is encoded. Specifically, the software fails to properly sanitize or neutralize this encoded input before using it in the output of a webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: The core vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79), which occurs when user-controlled data is included in a web page without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require local or adjacent network access.
- **User-supplied input:** The attack vector involves malicious user-supplied input. It is not explicitly stated how this input is provided (e.g. form field, URL parameter), but it is processed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious, encoded user-supplied input into the application.
- The attacker does not require any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Zenphoto version 1.4.7 and earlier are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Gen Sato of TRADE WORKS Co.,Ltd. Security Dept. to IPA.
- JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer (Zenphoto) for the resolution.
- A fix was released in Zenphoto version 1.4.8.
- The CVSS base score is 4.3.
- Access Complexity is rated as medium.
