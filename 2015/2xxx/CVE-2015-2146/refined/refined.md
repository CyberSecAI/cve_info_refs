**Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "Multiple SQL injection discovered by you" and assigns CVE-2015-2146 to it. This aligns with the CVE description, which relates to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities within the phpBugTracker version 1.6.0. The exact vulnerable code locations are not provided in this context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could potentially lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the phpBugTracker database.
    *   Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Potential compromise of the application and/or the server it runs on.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web application phpBugTracker v1.6.0. It is likely that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries. The specific attack locations/vectors are not detailed.
