Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `django.utils.http.is_safe_url` function within the Django framework. This function is intended to validate redirect URLs, ensuring they are safe to redirect to. However, it failed to properly handle URLs with leading control characters. This allowed URLs like `\x08javascript: ...` to be considered safe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: `is_safe_url()` didn't strip leading control characters from URLs before validation
- XSS vulnerability: By crafting URLs with leading control characters, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a link if a developer relies on `is_safe_url()` for safe redirects and then puts the URL into a link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page through a crafted URL. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing websites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Crafted URL: An attacker needs to create a URL containing leading control characters followed by a JavaScript code or a malicious URL.
-  User Interaction:  The vulnerability depends on the application putting such URLs into a link, where a browser might ignore the control characters and render malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the redirect URL used by a Django application.
- The attacker does not require authentication.
- The attacker needs to find an application that relies on is_safe_url to generate URL links to be rendered on the page

**Additional Notes:**
- While Django itself uses the `is_safe_url()` for HTTP Location headers and most browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there, the vulnerability surfaces if a developer uses the function to generate links on a web page where some browsers might execute javascript.
- The vulnerability is present in Django versions before: 1.4.20, 1.6.11, 1.7.7, and 1.8c1.
- The vulnerability is related to a possible XSS attack vector.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N. This indicates that the attack is network-based, has a medium complexity, does not require authentication, has no confidentiality impact, has a partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.
