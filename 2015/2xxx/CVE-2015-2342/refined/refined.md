{
  "CVE-2015-2342": {
    "description": "VMware vCenter Server contains a remotely accessible JMX RMI service that is not securely configured. An unauthenticated remote attacker who is able to connect to the service may be able to use it to execute arbitrary code on the vCenter Server. A local attacker may be able to elevate their privileges on vCenter Server.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability exists due to an insecure configuration of the JMX/RMI service within VMware vCenter Server. This service lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated remote access. Specifically, the 'javax.management.loading.MLet' function can be used to load an MBean from a remote URL.",
    "affected_software": [
      "VMware vCenter Server 6.0",
      "VMware vCenter Server 5.5",
      "VMware vCenter Server 5.1",
      "VMware vCenter Server 5.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insecure configuration of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) service, which does not require authentication, coupled with the ability to load MBeans from remote URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated JMX/RMI service",
      "Remote code execution via MLet function",
	  "Insecure default configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges on the vCenter server, leading to full compromise of the environment. Local privilege escalation is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access to the JMX/RMI service",
       "Exploitation of the `javax.management.loading.MLet` function"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable JMX/RMI service port (typically 9875) and the ability to host a malicious JAR file.",
	"additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be exploited using publicly available tools, including Metasploit modules. The issue was initially reported to VMware in February 2015, with fixes released in September and October 2015. A patch may also be required on Windows systems."
