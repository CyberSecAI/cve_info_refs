Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control in the `sam-ajax-admin.php` file of the Simple Ads Manager plugin. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is that the plugin exposes sensitive data via AJAX requests without proper authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Functions:** The `sam-ajax-admin.php` file contains several functions (`load_users`, `load_authors`, `load_cats`, `load_tags`, `load_posts`, `posts_debug`, `load_stats`, etc.) that can be accessed by sending a POST request with the `action` parameter set to one of these functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information such as user lists, author details, category and tag data, post data, and debug information. The specific impact depends on the nature of the revealed data and its potential use for further malicious activities.
*   This disclosure could aid in further attacks by revealing information about the WordPress installation and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP POST Requests:** An attacker can send a POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/simple-ads-manager/sam-ajax-admin.php` with the `action` parameter set to a vulnerable function (e.g., `action=load_users`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user role is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the plugin's files.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP POST requests and how to send them.

**Vulnerable Plugin Versions:**
*   Simple Ads Manager versions 2.5.94 and 2.5.96.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The plugin has been closed as of November 28, 2017, and is no longer available for download from the official WordPress Plugin Directory.
*   The provided information includes a proof-of-concept request and a list of vulnerable function calls.
*   There's a reference to a news article on itas.vn, which details this and other vulnerabilities, but the link is only an announcement and does not have more technical details.
