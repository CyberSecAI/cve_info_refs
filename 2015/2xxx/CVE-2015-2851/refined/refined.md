- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Synology Cloud Station sync client for OS X contains an executable named `client_chown` that allows users to change the ownership of files. This executable is installed as a setuid root executable, granting any user the ability to change ownership of arbitrary system files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) are present due to the `client_chown` executable being setuid root.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local standard OS X user can gain ownership over arbitrary system files. This can be leveraged to gain root privileges and fully compromise the host.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the vulnerable OS X system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local standard OS X user can exploit this vulnerability.
