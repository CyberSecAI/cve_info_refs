Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2094

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `WESPPlayback.WESPPlaybackCtrl.1` ActiveX control within WebGate WinRDS. The vulnerability occurs when the `PrintSiteImage`, `SaveSiteImage`, `PlaySiteAllChannel` and `StopSiteAllChannel` methods of the control copy arbitrary data to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled copy of data into a fixed-size stack buffer. This is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address or Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain, allowing them to redirect execution flow to their shellcode and gain control of the system. The code execution happens within the context of the browser process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by making the target visit a malicious web page or open a specially crafted file that embeds a malicious ActiveX control and exploits one of the vulnerable methods
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or deliver a malicious file to the victim.
    *   The victim needs to have WebGate WinRDS installed and the vulnerable ActiveX control enabled.
    *   User interaction is required as the victim must visit the malicious page or open the malicious file.

**Affected Products:**

*   WebGate WinRDS

**Specific Vulnerable Methods:**

*   `PrintSiteImage`
*  `SaveSiteImage`
*   `PlaySiteAllChannel`
*   `StopSiteAllChannel`

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary suggested mitigation is to set the killbit for the ActiveX control. This prevents the control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. This can be achieved by modifying the `Compatibility Flags` DWORD value for the control within the registry at: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\4E14C449-A61A-4BF7-8082-65A91298A6D8`. Setting the value to `0x00000400` disables the control.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was disclosed without a patch by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) due to the vendor's lack of response after multiple attempts to contact them.
*   The advisory notes that Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by specific Digital Vaccine filters (IDs mentioned in each advisory).

**Exploit Details**
* Exploit code for the `StopSiteAllChannel` method is provided. It includes shellcode to be executed and uses an SEH overwrite technique, which is detailed in the source code comments.
