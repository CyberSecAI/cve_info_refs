Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2060:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how `cabextract` handles filenames within cabinet (.cab) archives. It removes leading slashes from filenames *before* decoding UTF-8, and it doesn't properly check for invalid UTF-8 encoding. This allows for the use of overlong UTF-8 encodings to represent a leading slash, bypassing the intended path sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** By using overlong UTF-8 encodings for leading slashes (e.g., `\xe0\x80\xaf` for `/`), an attacker can embed absolute file paths in the archive, causing `cabextract` to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
*   **Improper UTF-8 Handling:** The code does not check for invalid UTF-8 sequences, which allows for the overlong encoding trick.
*   **Incorrect Path Separator Handling:** The program determines the path separator type (Unix or DOS) based on the initial filename content and applies it inconsistently, which, along with the lack of proper checks after decoding, can lead to issues in various environments (Cygwin). The program skips leading path separators before converting the remaining ones, which can cause unexpected results when processing paths containing both Unix and DOS path separators.
*   **Inconsistent Filename Interpretation:**  When a cab archive contains a single file with a name like `\/tmp/abs`, the program incorrectly creates a file named `\tmp\abs` in the current directory. This deviates from the documented behavior of preserving the internal directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can create a malicious .cab archive that, when extracted by `cabextract`, writes files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This can lead to overwriting existing files, creating new files, and potentially gaining code execution if a crafted file is placed in a sensitive location (e.g., in a startup folder).
*   **Code Execution:** If an attacker can place an executable file in a location used by the system or other applications, they might be able to achieve code execution.
*   **Unexpected Behavior in Cygwin:** The vulnerability manifests as an absolute path traversal in Cygwin, writing files to the Windows filesystem instead of the Cygwin file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious .cab Archive:** The attacker creates a specially crafted .cab archive containing a file with a malicious path.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into extracting the malicious archive using a vulnerable version of `cabextract`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create .cab Archives:** The attacker must be able to craft a .cab archive with the specific file structure to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to extract the malicious archive using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `cabextract` versions 1.4 and 1.5. Version 1.4 was vulnerable with 2-byte overlong encoding of '/', version 1.5 needed 3-byte encoding.
*   A fix was rapidly developed and committed to the libmspack code repository.
*   The CVE assignment team noted that the behavior in Cygwin was an absolute path traversal and should be considered a separate issue.
*  The use of `tolower()` on arbitrary unicode input could have further implications and was flagged for further analysis.
* The vulnerability also can manifest when the archive has only one file and the filename starts with '\' followed by '/' characters
