Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2381:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Windows kernel-mode driver (`win32k.sys`).
- It is caused by the driver leaking private address information during a function call.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability, specifically leaking kernel memory contents.
- The driver improperly handles memory, leading to the leakage of private address information during function calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain information about the system's memory layout.
- This leaked information could be combined with other attacks to compromise the system.
- The vulnerability itself does not allow arbitrary code execution.
- An attacker can use the information to bypass security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a function call within the affected kernel-mode driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the affected function call in the kernel-mode driver. This often implies the ability to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to make calls that cause the kernel-mode driver to leak the private address information.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text also contains information on other vulnerabilities addressed by the same patch (MS15-073). These other vulnerabilities are separate and include several elevation of privilege and information disclosure issues.
- The content specifies that Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated disclosure.
- It is explicitly mentioned that at the time of the bulletin's release there was no indication that this vulnerability was actively being used to attack customers.
