Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the ZDI advisory, which relates to CVE-2015-2120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the Log Analysis Tool of Hewlett-Packard SiteScope. The tool fails to restrict or validate the log path, allowing users to specify arbitrary paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is the ability to specify an arbitrary file path, potentially leading to path traversal attacks.
- **Missing Access Control:** The Log Analysis Tool lacks sufficient access control and input validation to prevent the reading of sensitive files such as the `users.config` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an authenticated user to escalate their privileges to an administrator role by reading the `users.config` file. This file likely contains sensitive information (e.g., credentials) that can be used to gain administrative access.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file accessible to the SiteScope service account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the SiteScope application.
