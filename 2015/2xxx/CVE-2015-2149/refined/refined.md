Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the administrative backend of MyBB v1.8.3. Specifically, various form fields across different modules fail to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into various form fields within the admin panel.

**Vulnerable Modules and Form Fields:**
The following modules and form fields are vulnerable:

*   **config-attachment\_types:** MIME-type field
*   **config-mycode:** title and short description fields
*   **forum-management:** title field
*   **user-groups:** title and/or short description fields
*   **style-templates:** name field (when adding a set), and title field (when adding a template group)
*   **tool-tasks:** title field
*   **config-post\_icons:** name field
*   **user-titles:** title to assign field
*   **config-banning:** username field

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser session.
*   Potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
*   Modify the appearance or behavior of the administrative interface.
*   Redirect administrators to malicious websites.
*   Perform other malicious actions as permitted by the administrator's access rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted input submitted via vulnerable form fields within the MyBB administration panel. An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have administrative access to the MyBB forum's admin panel. This limits the vulnerability to a user with administrative privileges, or an attacker that has compromised an admin user account.

**Additional Notes**
*   The identified vulnerabilities were fixed in MyBB version 1.8.4.
*   The CVE assignment is limited to the issues reported by adamziaja, Devilshakerz, DingjieYang and sroesemann, and does not cover other vulnerabilities fixed in the 1.8.4 release.
