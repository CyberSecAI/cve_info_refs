```
Root cause of vulnerability: The HYPERVISOR_xen_version() hypercall fails to fully initialize all fields of structures subsequently copied back to guest memory.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information leak due to uninitialized memory being copied to guest.

Impact of exploitation: A malicious guest can potentially read sensitive hypervisor stack data relating to other guests.

Attack vectors: A malicious guest can call the HYPERVISOR_xen_version() hypercall.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a Xen guest.
