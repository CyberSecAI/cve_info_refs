Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) explicitly allowing the use of the outdated and insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0 protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use of Insecure Protocol:** The primary weakness is the support for SSL 2.0, which is known to be vulnerable to various attacks. This insecure protocol can be forced by an attacker in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Information Disclosure:** By forcing an SSL 2.0 session, an attacker can decrypt portions of encrypted network information traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation leads to the decryption of sensitive network traffic. This could expose confidential data being transmitted.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker could intercept and decrypt communications between a client and server due to the use of the vulnerable SSL 2.0 protocol.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts network communications between a client and a server.
- **Forced SSL 2.0 Session:** The attacker forces the communication to use SSL 2.0, even if the server supports more secure protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
- **Active Network Position:** The attacker needs to be actively participating in the network connection between the client and server to be able to force a downgrade to SSL 2.0.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is present in Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML).
- The vulnerability is mitigated by configuring MSXML to use more secure network protocols by default, instead of SSL 2.0. This is the fix implemented in the security update.
- The vulnerability itself does not allow for code execution or privilege escalation. Its main impact is the potential for information disclosure through decrypted traffic.
- The provided content also mentions CVE-2015-2434 and CVE-2015-2440 which are related vulnerabilities in MSXML.
