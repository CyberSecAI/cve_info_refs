Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way phpMyAdmin handles invalid language values in error responses. Specifically, when an unknown language is requested, the application reflects this invalid value in the error message. This reflected value includes the CSRF token and can be sent with HTTP compression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Parameter:** The application reflects the invalid language parameter in the error message.
*   **CSRF Token Exposure:** The error response includes a CSRF token.
*   **BREACH Attack:** The combination of reflected parameter, CSRF token and HTTP compression allows an attacker to perform a BREACH attack to infer the CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can infer the CSRF token used by phpMyAdmin.
*   This can potentially lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks after the CSRF token is inferred if coupled with another vulnerability that allows javascript injection into the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a series of crafted requests.
*   The attacker needs to induce the victim's browser to make requests with manipulated language parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a large number of crafted requests to the victim's browser.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject Javascript into the victim's browser.
*   The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered non-critical by the phpMyAdmin team due to the requirement of another vulnerability to perform a successful attack.
*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.9), 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.13.2), and 4.3.x (prior to 4.3.11.1).
*   Patches have been made available in the form of git commits, and upgrading to the fixed versions resolves the issue.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CWE-661 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) and CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
