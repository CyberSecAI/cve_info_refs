The provided content is related to CVE-2015-2398.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An XSS filter bypass vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer due to incorrect handling of HTML attributes in filtered HTTP response data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XSS Filter Bypass:** The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer's XSS filter disables HTML attributes. Instead of preventing the script, the filter causes a condition where initially disabled scripts can run in the wrong security context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation can lead to information disclosure by enabling malicious scripts to run in the security context of a third-party website.
*   **Script execution in the wrong context:** An attacker could execute script code on another user's system, posing as a third-party website, with the ability to perform actions permitted to the third-party site.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious website:** An attacker hosts a website containing specially crafted content to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised websites:** Attackers can exploit compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or ads by injecting malicious code.
*   **User Interaction:** Attack requires user interaction by visiting a malicious site or clicking a crafted link, such as in an HTML email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to host content:** The attacker needs the ability to host or inject malicious content onto a webpage that users will access.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious site or interact with malicious links.
