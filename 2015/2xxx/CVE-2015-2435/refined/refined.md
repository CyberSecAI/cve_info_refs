Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-2435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType fonts. Specifically, a crafted glyph within a TrueType font can cause a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A specially crafted TrueType font can trigger a buffer overflow in `win32k!vCopyClearTypeBits` within the Windows kernel. This allows for read and write access to kernel memory.
- **Improper Handling of TrueType Fonts:** The underlying issue is the failure of Windows components, including those in .NET Framework, Office, Lync, and Silverlight, to properly handle TrueType fonts, leading to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Complete System Control:** The attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can embed a malicious TrueType font in a webpage. When a user visits the page, the vulnerability can be exploited.
- **Malicious Document:** An attacker can embed a malicious TrueType font within a document (e.g., Office document). When a user opens the document, the vulnerability can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Crafted TrueType Font:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a specific TrueType font to trigger the overflow in the Windows kernel.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Microsoft products, including Windows, .NET Framework, Office, Lync, and Silverlight.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or visit an untrusted webpage containing the malicious font.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType fonts.
- The ZDI advisory provides the specific vulnerable function: `win32k!vCopyClearTypeBits`.
- The Microsoft bulletin (MS15-080) indicates that the vulnerability is related to how the Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType fonts.
- The MS bulletin categorizes this as a "Critical" vulnerability with "Remote Code Execution" impact.
