          "additional_details": "The exploit is demonstrated with Python Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts targeting three executables: ftdwprt.exe, ftdwinvw.exe, and pcsws.exe. These scripts achieve arbitrary code execution through direct EIP overwrite or SEH overwrite techniques. The service 'Cwbrxd.exe' accepts remote commands, allowing for the possibility of remote exploitation."

  "summary": "The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in IBM i Access for Windows that allows local and potentially remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by overflowing a buffer. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted Windows system. Multiple executables are vulnerable and can be used as an attack vector."
