Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `das_watchdog` daemon. Specifically, the overflow occurs within the `get_pid_environ_val` function. This function is used to retrieve the value of environment variables for a given process. The root cause is a lack of proper bounds checking when reading the environment variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `get_pid_environ_val` function reads environment variables from a process, and copies this data into a buffer. The code initializes a buffer of size 500 bytes using malloc(), and if the environment variable is larger, it reallocates the buffer with double the original size. However, it does not check the size of the environment variable *before* reading, and does not check the return value of realloc(). This lack of proper checks allows an attacker to provide an environment variable of arbitrary size, overwriting adjacent memory locations on the heap.
*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered when handling the `XAUTHORITY` environment variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. The ability to write to arbitrary memory locations means an attacker can gain control over the program, and then execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `das_watchdog` process, which is root.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where `das_watchdog` is running.
*   **Manipulated Environment Variable:** The attacker needs to manipulate the `XAUTHORITY` environment variable of a monitored process to cause the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user account on the system.
*   The ability to execute programs that are being monitored by `das_watchdog`, or to manipulate the environment variables of such processes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Adam Sampson and was reported to Debian.
*   The fix involves adding the realloc() call and checking the size *before* reading in the while loop.
*   The vulnerability was present in `das_watchdog` versions prior to 0.9.0-2+deb7u1 for Debian Wheezy, and prior to 0.9.0-3.1 for Debian Sid.
