Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2015-2280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an OS command injection flaw in the `snwrite.cgi` binary of the AirLink101 SkyIPCam1620W Wireless N MPEG4 3GPP Network Camera. Specifically, the `mac` parameter is used in a `printf()` call to construct a shell command that executes the `macwrite.sh` script. This string is then passed to `system()` without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization of the `mac` parameter before being used in a system call. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):**  The device contains a backdoor account (`productmaker:ftvsbannedcode`) with hardcoded credentials stored in `/server/usr.ini`. This account allows attackers to access the vulnerable `snwrite.cgi` binary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This could lead to complete control over the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP request to `/maker/snwrite.cgi` including the `mac` parameter with the malicious payload. Example: `http://<Camera_IP>/maker/snwrite.cgi?mac=1234;ps`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the device.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access the `/maker/snwrite.cgi` page. This can be achieved using the backdoor credentials (`productmaker:ftvsbannedcode`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in AirLink101 SkyIPCam1620W with firmware version `FW_AIC1620W_1.1.0-12_20120709_r1192.pck` (August 2012) and possibly other devices using the same firmware.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is provided: sending a crafted request to `/maker/snwrite.cgi` with a malicious `mac` parameter.
*   The advisory recommends using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests as a workaround.
