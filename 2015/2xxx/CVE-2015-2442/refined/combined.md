## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3084525)

Published: August 11, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Edge on affected Windows clients. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory
* Helping to ensure that affected versions of Microsoft Edge properly implement the ASLR security feature

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Microsoft Edge is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2441](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2441) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2442](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2442) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2446](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2446) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## ASLR Bypass

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge fails to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Microsoft Edge, and browses to a malicious site. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected versions of Microsoft Edge properly implement the ASLR security feature. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASLR Bypass | [CVE-2015-2449](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2449) | No | No |

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2441](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2441) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2442](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2442) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2443](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2443) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2444](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2444) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2446](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2446) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2447](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2447) | No | No |
| Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-2448](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2448) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple ASLR Bypass Vulnerabilities

Security feature bypass vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer fails to use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to more reliably run arbitrary code on a target system.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer, and browses to a malicious site. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses these vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASLR Bypass | [CVE-2015-2445](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2445) | No | No |
| ASLR Bypass | [CVE-2015-2449](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-2449) | No | No |

## Unsafe Command Line Parameter Passing Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2423

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Office when files at a medium integrity level become accessible to Internet Explorer running in Enhanced Protection Mode (EPM).

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first need to leverage another vulnerability and execute code in Internet Explorer with EPM, and then execute Excel, Notepad, PowerPoint, Visio, or Word using an unsafe command line parameter. The update addresses the vulnerability by improving how Notepad and Microsoft Office programs are executed from Internet Explorer.

**Important** To be protected from this vulnerability, customers must apply the updates provided in this bulletin, as well as Windows updates provided in [MS15-088](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619632). Likewise, customers running an affected Microsoft Office product must also apply the applicable updates provided in [MS15-081](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619678). Customers who do not install all of the updates available for their affected software will not be fully protected from the vulnerability.
