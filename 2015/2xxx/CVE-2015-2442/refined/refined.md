Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from memory corruption due to how Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer improperly access objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Corruption: The vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt memory in a way that enables them to execute arbitrary code.
- Improper Memory Access: Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are improperly handling objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially Crafted Webpages: Attackers can host malicious websites designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into legitimate websites or user-provided content (like advertisements).
- Social Engineering: Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website, typically through links in emails or instant messages, or by getting them to open malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a website or inject content into an existing site.
- Requires user interaction to be exploited (convincing the user to visit a malicious page or open an attachment).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The vulnerability affects both Microsoft Edge and multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
- The fix involves modifying how both browsers handle objects in memory.
- The provided document also details multiple other CVEs, including other memory corruption vulnerabilities and ASLR bypass vulnerabilities, which are addressed in the same security update.
