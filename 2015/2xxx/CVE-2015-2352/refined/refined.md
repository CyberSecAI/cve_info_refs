This blog post announces the release of MyBB 1.8.4, which includes fixes for several vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of the relevant security information:

**Vulnerabilities Fixed in MyBB 1.8.4:**

*   **Medium Risk:**
    *   **XSS vulnerability in `member.php`:** This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that was reported by ATofighi.
    *  **XSS vulnerability in MyCode editor:** This XSS vulnerability was reported by Matthias Ungeth√ºm.
*   **Low Risk:**
    *   **Multiple XSS vulnerabilities requiring admin permissions:** This vulnerability was reported by adamziaja, Devilshakerz, DingjieYang, and sroesemann. The requirement of admin permissions suggests these vulnerabilities are exploitable by an already authenticated admin user.
    *   **CSRF vulnerability within ACP login:** This is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability affecting the Admin Control Panel (ACP) login process, reported by Devilshakerz.
    *   **Group join request notifications sent to wrong group leaders:** While technically a bug, this could potentially lead to unintended information disclosure or actions. This was reported by Snake\_.
    *   **Cache handler using `var_export` without encoding checks:** This could lead to potential code injection vulnerabilities. Reported by chtg.
*  **No Risk:**
    *   **Full path disclosure vulnerability within JSON library:** This is an information disclosure vulnerability but is considered low risk as it does not directly enable further compromise. Reported by Nathan Malcolm.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   The blog post doesn't provide the root cause of each vulnerability, but the general categories are:
    *   **XSS:** Improper handling of user input leading to the ability to inject client-side scripts.
    *   **CSRF:** Lack of proper CSRF protection in the ACP login.
    *   **Code injection**: Unsafe use of `var_export` in cache handler.
    *   **Information Disclosure**: Full path disclosure within JSON library

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary script execution in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, account compromise, or defacement.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker could potentially trick an administrator into performing actions on the forum without their knowledge, such as modifying settings or performing other administrative functions.
*  **Code injection**: An attacker could inject arbitrary code into the cache and potentially execute it.
*  **Information disclosure**: An attacker could discover the full server paths which could aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The attack vector would involve injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable `member.php` page, MyCode editor or areas within the admin panel.
*   **CSRF:** This would likely involve tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link.
*   **Code injection**: Likely related to cache manipulation and requires a certain degree of control over input.
*   **Information disclosure**: Likely occurs when accessing certain files or resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:**  For the vulnerabilities in `member.php` and the MyCode editor, the attacker would need the ability to inject malicious content or manipulate user input. For the admin panel XSS vulnerabilities the attacker would already require admin permissions.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into unknowingly making a request.
*   **Code injection**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the cache.
*   **Information disclosure**: No specific permissions, possibly just access to the resource with a vulnerable implementation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post emphasizes the importance of upgrading to version 1.8.4 to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The post also advises users to report security vulnerabilities privately through the MyBB website or forum rather than publicly disclosing them.

Based on the content, this blog post relates to **CVE-2015-2352** by providing context for security fixes in MyBB 1.8.4. However, it does not provide an individual CVE assignment for each vulnerability, therefore it is unclear if any one of the vulnerabilities mentioned is CVE-2015-2352.
