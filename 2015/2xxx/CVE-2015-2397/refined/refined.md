- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view the website. Alternatively, they could leverage compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content to inject the malicious content. Attackers could also try to get users to click a link via email or instant messages, or open attachments sent via email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website or other means (e.g., malicious link or attachment) to lure the user. The user must then interact with that content using an affected version of Internet Explorer.
