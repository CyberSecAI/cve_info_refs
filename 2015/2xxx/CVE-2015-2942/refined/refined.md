Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2942:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a "Billion Laughs" attack, a type of XML denial-of-service (DoS), that occurs when parsing SVG and XMP metadata using the HHVM runtime.
*   The vulnerability exists in how HHVM handles XML entity expansion in the `xml_parse` function, which is used by MediaWiki.  HHVM will expand the entities, unlike Zend.
*   Specifically, the issue arises when processing XML documents containing nested or recursive entity definitions, leading to exponential memory consumption and CPU usage.
*   The vulnerability is not present when running MediaWiki under Zend PHP due to differing behaviors in entity expansion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XML Entity Expansion:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper limits or sanitization when expanding XML entities.
*   **HHVM Behavior:** The `xml_parse` function in HHVM aggressively expands entities when processing the XML, while Zend does not, which exacerbates the DoS risk.
*   **Lack of Resource Limits:** The memory and execution time limits that are expected to be present might be misconfigured or missing, exposing the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can upload a specially crafted SVG or XMP file, causing the HHVM-based MediaWiki server to exhaust memory and/or CPU resources, leading to service unavailability.
*   **System Unresponsiveness:** The server becomes unresponsive, affecting legitimate users and potentially impacting the entire MediaWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the upload of malicious SVG or XMP files.
*   **User-Generated Content:** An attacker can embed these malicious files as content, which will be parsed and trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the capability to upload files to the MediaWiki instance, either directly or through other mechanisms (e.g., user-generated content).
*   **Targeted HHVM Instance:** The attacker must target a MediaWiki instance that is running on HHVM, because the vulnerability is specific to HHVM's XML parsing.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to create a “Billion Laughs” XML payload, using nested XML entities to cause the vulnerability to trigger.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of SVG files (which might include an XMP block) or other files with XMP metadata.
