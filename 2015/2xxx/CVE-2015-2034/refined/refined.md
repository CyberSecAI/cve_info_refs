Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with Piwigo <= v2.7.3, which are referenced in the advisory:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability lies in the way the `page` parameter within the `admin.php` file is handled. The application fails to sanitize user input passed through this parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability exists in the "History" functionality within the administrative backend, specifically through the `user` parameter in a POST request. The application fails to properly sanitize SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Improper sanitization of user input in the `page` parameter in `admin.php`.
*  **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user input in the `user` parameter within the "History" feature of `admin.php`, allowing manipulation of SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that could be executed in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, data exfiltration, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `page` parameter within the `admin.php` file.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `admin.php?page=history` with malicious SQL code within the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. They would need to entice a user (likely an administrator) to click this crafted URL while logged into the Piwigo admin panel, or otherwise inject the crafted URL into the context of an admin user's session.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `/admin.php?page=history` endpoint, typically from a web browser or a crafted script and also needs to be authenticated within the Piwigo admin panel.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides specific exploit examples for both the XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities, along with the vulnerable component paths.
*   The advisory notes that the vulnerabilities were patched in version 2.7.4 of Piwigo, released on 17th February 2015.
*   The advisory also includes a timeline of the disclosure process, showing the discovery date, vendor contact, and patch release.

This information is consistent with typical XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
