Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply cell protection concept (see https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-

security)

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells

• Apply Defense-in-Depth (see http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/

concept/Pages/defense-in-depth.aspx)

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC HMI Panels, SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced, and SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional
are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC NET PC-Software is required for communication between controller (SIMATIC S7 controller)
and PC based solutions (e.g. SIMATIC WinCC).

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. It is used to monitor
and control physical processes involved in industry and infrastructure on a large scale and over long
distances.

SIMATIC Automation Tool allows commissioning, adjusting and service in combination with S7-1200 and
S7-1500 Controllers without engineering framework.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-1601

Attackers with access to the network path between PLCs and their communication partners could
possibly intercept or modify Siemens industrial communications at port 102/tcp and conduct a Man-in-
the-Middle attack. This vulnerability affects all listed products.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-2822

Attackers with access to the network path between an HMI panel and a PLC (Man-in-theMiddle) could
possibly conduct a Denial-of-Service attack against the HMI panel by sending specially crafted packets
to the HMI (port 102/tcp). This vulnerability affects SIMATIC WinCC Comfort Panels and SIMATIC
WinCC Runtime Advanced.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

5.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues

Vulnerability CVE-2015-2823

If attackers obtain password hashes for SIMATIC WinCC users, they could possibly use the hashes to
authenticate themselves. This vulnerability affects SIMATIC WinCC.

CVSS Vector
CWE

8.1
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C

thentication
