Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-2823:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of password hashes for authentication instead of actual passwords.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system stores and potentially uses password hashes in a way that allows an attacker, with access to these hashes, to authenticate as a valid user.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who obtains password hashes can gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network based (AV:N) with a high level of complexity (AC:H), and does not require user interaction.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to obtain the password hashes, but the document does not specify how the hashes are exposed. It is stated that no privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability after obtaining the hashes.

**Affected Products:**
*   SIMATIC WinCC
