| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913056#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-14 09:50:53 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-0221  In older versions of Django, the ``django.views.static.serve()`` view read the files it served one line at a time. Therefore, a big file with no newlines would result in memory usage equal to the size of that file. An attacker could exploit this and launch a denial-of-service attack by simultaneously requesting many large files. This view now reads the file in chunks to prevent large memory usage.  Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is not hardened for production use and should be used only as a development aid. Now may be a good time to audit your project and serve your files in production using a real front-end web server if you are not doing so.

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

## Security releases issued

Posted by **Tim Graham** on March 18, 2015

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.20, 1.6.11, 1.7.7 and 1.8c1. These releases are now available on PyPI and our download page. These releases address several security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch has also been updated.

Django 1.8 is now at release candidate stage. This marks the string freeze and the call for translators [to submit translations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/#translations). Provided no major bugs are discovered that can't be solved in the next two weeks, 1.8 final will be issued on or around April 1. Any delays will be communicated on the [django-developers mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/74_MZK27TAE/discussion).

### Denial-of-service possibility with strip\_tags()

Last year django.utils.html.strip\_tags was changed to work
iteratively. The problem is that the size of the input it's processing can
increase on each iteration which results in an infinite loop in
strip\_tags(). This issue only affects versions of Python that haven't
received [a bugfix in HTMLParser](http://bugs.python.org/issue20288); namely
Python < 2.7.7 and 3.3.5. Some operating system vendors have also backported
the fix for the Python bug into their packages of earlier versions.

To remedy this issue, strip\_tags() will now return the original input if
it detects the length of the string it's processing increases. Remember that
absolutely NO guarantee is provided about the results of strip\_tags() being
HTML safe. So NEVER mark safe the result of a strip\_tags() call without
escaping it first, for example with django.utils.html.escape.

Thanks Andrey Babak for reporting the issue.

This issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2015-2316.

### Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs

Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
django.contrib.auth.views.login and i18n)
to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security checks for these
redirects (namely django.utils.http.is\_safe\_url()) accepted URLs with
leading control characters and so considered URLs like \x08javascript:...
safe. This issue doesn't affect Django currently, since we only put this URL
into the Location response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript
there. Browsers we tested also treat URLs prefixed with control characters such
as %08//example.com as relative paths so redirection to an unsafe target
isn't a problem either.

However, if a developer relies on is\_safe\_url() to
provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could
suffer from an XSS attack as some browsers such as Google Chrome ignore control
characters at the start of a URL in an anchor href.

Thanks Daniel Chatfield for reporting the issue.

This issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2015-2317.

### Affected versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 1.8 (currently at release candidate status)
* Django 1.7
* Django 1.6
* Django 1.4 (is\_safe\_url() issue only)

Per our [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions), Django 1.5 is no longer receiving security updates.

### Resolution

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913053#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-14 09:47:08 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-0219   When HTTP headers are placed into the WSGI environ, they are normalized by converting to uppercase, converting all dashes to underscores, and prepending `HTTP_`. For instance, a header ``X-Auth-User`` would become ``HTTP_X_AUTH_USER`` in the WSGI environ (and thus also in Django's ``request.META`` dictionary).  Unfortunately, this means that the WSGI environ cannot distinguish between headers containing dashes and headers containing underscores: ``X-Auth-User`` and ``X-Auth_User`` both become ``HTTP_X_AUTH_USER``. This means that if a header is used in a security-sensitive way (for instance, passing authentication information along from a front-end proxy), even if the proxy carefully strips any incoming value for ``X-Auth-User``, an attacker may be able to provide an ``X-Auth_User`` header (with underscore) and bypass this protection.  In order to prevent such attacks, both Nginx and Apache 2.4+ strip all headers containing underscores from incoming requests by default. Django's built-in development server now does the same. Django's development server is not recommended for production use, but matching the behavior of common production servers reduces the surface area for behavior changes during deployment.

# USN-2539-1: Django vulnerabilities

23 March 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Andrey Babak discovered that Django incorrectly handled strip\_tags. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Django to enter an

infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2015-2316](/security/CVE-2015-2316))

Daniel Chatfield discovered that Django incorrectly handled user-supplied

redirect URLs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

cross-site scripting attack. ([CVE-2015-2317](/security/CVE-2015-2317))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-03-19 12:24:18 UTC  ``` via <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/mar/18/security-releases/>  Denial-of-service possibility with strip_tags()  Last year django.utils.html.strip_tags was changed to work iteratively. The problem is that the size of the input it's processing can increase on each iteration which results in an infinite loop in strip_tags(). This issue only affects versions of Python that haven't received a bugfix in HTMLParser; namely Python < 2.7.7 and 3.3.5. Some operating system vendors have also backported the fix for the Python bug into their packages of earlier versions.  To remedy this issue, strip_tags() will now return the original input if it detects the length of the string it's processing increases. Remember that absolutely NO guarantee is provided about the results of strip_tags() being HTML safe. So NEVER mark safe the result of a strip_tags() call without escaping it first, for example with django.utils.html.escape.  Thanks Andrey Babak for reporting the issue.  This issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2015-2316. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2015-03-19 12:24:35 UTC  ``` can you cross check if 1.4 is not affected too please ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2015-03-19 12:25:11 UTC  ``` and 1.5.x ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-19 23:00:13 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c4)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-03-20 12:49:50 UTC  ``` 1.4 and 1.5 implement strip_tags with a regexp so should not be affected.  will need an update for python-Django-1.6 in SUSE Cloud 5 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c6)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-03-20 14:00:09 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (923172) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/292041> 13.2 / python-Django ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c7)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-03-24 17:00:23 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (923172) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/292722> 13.2 / python-Django ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=923172#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-25 16:32:54 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=913055#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-14 09:49:52 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-0222  Given a form that uses ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` and ``show_hidden_initial=True`` (not a documented API), it was possible for a user to cause an unreasonable number of SQL queries by submitting duplicate values for the field's data. The validation logic in ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` now deduplicates submitted values to address this issue.
