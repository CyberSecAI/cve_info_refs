When these CVEs are published on the cve.mitre.org web site, there may
be further information about which specific attacks are characterized
with CSRF as the only primary vulnerability, and which specific
attacks are characterized otherwise (e.g., a primary vulnerability of
XSS).

The ability of one admin account to enter XSS intentionally, in order
to compromise another equivalent admin account, does not inherently
cross privilege boundaries and is not inherently eligible for a CVE
ID. However, if the vendor specifically announces that a
"vulnerability" fix has been made for such an issue, MITRE typically
defers to the vendor's judgment that the issue is actually a violation
of the product's security policy, and therefore is within the scope of
CVE. The existence of a vendor commit with a fix, however, does not
(by itself) establish a security policy.

## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Feb 5, 2015](https://github.com/a-v-k/phpBugTracker/issues/4#issue-56693237)

Dear development team.

I found multiple SQL injection-, reflecting/stored XSS- and CSRF-vulnerabilities in your product phpBugTracker v.1.6.0.

Please provide me an email-address where I can send the technical details to. Otherwise, if you don't mind, I can post them directly on Github.

I have released a security advisory without technical details here: <http://sroesemann.blogspot.de/2015/02/sroeadv-2015-16.html>.

If you don't respond until 19th February 2015 (UTC+1), I will as well release the technical details of these issues and send the vulnerabilities to the security mailing list FullDisclosure, to warn people.

Thank you for your attention.

Greetings from Germany.

Steffen Rösemann
