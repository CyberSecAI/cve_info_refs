**Vulnerability 1**
*   **Root cause:** Stack and heap buffer overflows in the `GetRecFileInfo` method of the `FileConverter.FileConverterCtrl.1` control.
*   **Weakness:** The `GetRecFileInfo` method copies arbitrary data into fixed-size buffers on the heap and stack, leading to buffer overflows.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.
*   **Attack vector:** The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious page or file to the target user.

**Vulnerability 2**
*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `GetThumbnail` method of the `WESPPlayback.WESPPlaybackCtrl.1` control.
*   **Weakness:** The `GetThumbnail` method copies arbitrary data to a fixed-size stack buffer, causing a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.
*   **Attack vector:** The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious page or file to the target user.

**Vulnerability 3**
*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `Login` method of the `LoginContoller.LoginControllerCtrl.1` control.
*   **Weakness:** The `Login` method copies arbitrary data to a fixed-size stack buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.
*   **Attack vector:** The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious page or file to the target user.

**General details for all vulnerabilities:**

*   **Affected Product:** WebGate Control Center
*   **Mitigation:** Setting the killbit on the respective ActiveX control to disable scripting in Internet Explorer. This involves modifying the `Compatibility Flags` DWORD in the registry.
    *   `FileConverter.FileConverterCtrl.1`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\A13012BD-5A43-421A-B898-A6D13926210E`
    *   `WESPPlayback.WESPPlaybackCtrl.1`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\4E14C449-A61A-4BF7-8082-65A91298A6D8`
    *  `LoginContoller.LoginControllerCtrl.1`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\4A33C147-5243-4982-899A-A533BEDA99D1`
   Setting the `Compatibility Flags` value to `0x00000400` disables the control.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerabilities were disclosed publicly without a patch, following ZDI's 120-day deadline policy.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) for all listed vulnerabilities.
*   **Vendor Response:** No vendor response was received by ZDI, despite multiple attempts to contact them.
