- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper access of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view it. Alternatively, compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could be used to deliver the exploit. The attacker needs to convince users to interact with the malicious content, typically by clicking a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or compromise a website and convince a user to visit that website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. No specific user privileges or system access is required prior to exploitation.
