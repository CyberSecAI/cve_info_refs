Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-2347

**Description:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the Huawei SEQ Analyst product.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing XML parameters within certain URLs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the application reflects unsanitized user input, specifically within XML parameters, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to a range of malicious actions.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*  **Data theft:** Sensitive data may be exposed.
*   **Malware Injection:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious websites, or inject malware into the system.
*  **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the content of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URLs:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the vulnerable XML parameter. This URL is then delivered to the victim (e.g., via phishing email, malicious link).
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerability affects the `command`, and `module` parameters within the following URLs:
    *   `/common/flexdata.action`
    *   `/monitor/flexdata.action`
    *   `/psnpm/flexdata.action`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local, Authenticated:** The attacker is required to have local access and be authenticated to the application. This suggests that it is not accessible to the public without any authorization.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in how the application processes XML parameters within the vulnerable URLs.
*   The attacker injects a JavaScript payload, such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, within the XML parameter.
* Sample Payload: 261e9<script>alert(1)</script>57114

**Affected Product:**
* Huawei SEQ Analyst V200R002C03LG0001SPC100 (other versions may be vulnerable)

**Fix Information:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in SEQ Analyst V200R002C03LG0001CP0022.
