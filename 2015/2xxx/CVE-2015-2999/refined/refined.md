Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2999:

**CVE-2015-2999**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL injection vulnerabilities exist within the SysAid Help Desk application due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in several parameters of `genericreport`, `HelpDesk.jsp`, and `RFCGantt.jsp` pages.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled inputs in parameters such as `groupFilter`, `customSQL`, and `dir` in the `genericreport` and `HelpDesk.jsp` pages, and `ganttSQL` parameter in `RFCGantt.jsp`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information)
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    *   Privilege escalation (potentially gaining access to administrative functions)
    *   Denial of service (by crashing the database server)
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP POST requests to `/sysaid/genericreport`, `/sysaid/HelpDesk.jsp` and `/sysaid/RFCGantt.jsp`.
    *   The vulnerable parameters are: `groupFilter`, `customSQL` (in `genericreport`), `dir` (in `HelpDesk.jsp`), and `ganttSQL` (in `RFCGantt.jsp`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a valid administrator account to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
*   The provided text gives specific examples of vulnerable parameters in `genericreport`, `HelpDesk.jsp`, and `RFCGantt.jsp`, along with sample HTTP POST requests and payloads demonstrating the SQL injection.

* The report notes that the vulnerable parameters vary depending on the `reportName` in `genericreport`, providing multiple examples of different injectable parameters.

*   The report also notes that the injection is accepted between $$ in the ganttSQL parameter.
