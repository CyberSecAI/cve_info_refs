Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper permission validation within Internet Explorer under specific conditions. This allows scripts to run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  Internet Explorer fails to properly validate permissions, leading to scripts potentially running with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could leverage the elevated privileges gained through this vulnerability, potentially in conjunction with another vulnerability (like a Remote Code Execution - RCE), to run arbitrary code with medium integrity level privileges (permissions of the current user).
*   Although this vulnerability does not allow for arbitrary code execution on its own, it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the current user's permissions if chained with another vulnerability, bypassing restrictions that the browser would normally impose.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit the vulnerability and lure the user to the website.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites accepting user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the attacker-controlled website or interact with the malicious content. This typically involves tricking the user into clicking a link.
*   **Chaining with another vulnerability:** An attacker needs to chain this vulnerability with another vulnerability in order to execute code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 7 through 11.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional permission validations in Internet Explorer.
*   The provided document also lists mitigating factors and workarounds.
