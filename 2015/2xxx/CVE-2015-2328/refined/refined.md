{
  "CVE-2015-2328": {
    "Description": "PCRE is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of patterns with certain internal recursive back references. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted regular expression to cause a segmentation fault.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of patterns with certain internal recursive back references",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite recursion while compiling regex patterns with recursive references within a group with indefinite repeat."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to a segmentation fault.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By providing a specially crafted regular expression that includes a recursive reference in a group with indefinite repeat."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide an arbitrary regular expression"
  }
}
