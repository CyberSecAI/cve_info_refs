{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-2327",
    "description": "The PCRE library, as used in PHP, MongoDB, and other products, is vulnerable to an infinite recursion during regular expression compilation when dealing with zero-repeated groups that contain a recursive back reference.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1",
      "Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Workstation) 1",
       "MongoDB",
       "PHP"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite recursion during regular expression compilation in the PCRE library. This occurs when a regular expression includes a zero-repeated group with a recursive back reference.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Infinite recursion",
      "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service due to a stack overflow or crash. In some contexts, it might potentially enable arbitrary code execution, although this is less likely.",
    "attack_vector": "The primary attack vector is through crafted regular expressions. This requires the attacker to provide a malicious regular expression to an application that uses the vulnerable PCRE library.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted regular expression. This might involve direct manipulation of a configuration or through an interface that allows regex input.",
    "additional_information": "The issue was present in PCRE versions prior to 8.36 and fixed in 8.36. The exploit can cause a crash in MongoDB and other products using the vulnerable PCRE library. The related vulnerability for recursive reference in a group with indefinite repeat is CVE-2015-2328."
