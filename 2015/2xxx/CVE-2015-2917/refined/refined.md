- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Securifi Almond and Almond 2015 web management interfaces do not enforce the same-origin policy in X-Frame-Options response headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation, specifically the lack of same-origin policy enforcement via X-Frame-Options headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can conduct clickjacking attacks by tricking users into interacting with hidden UI elements within a specially crafted web page.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who creates a malicious web page that embeds the vulnerable web management interface within an iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a webpage and to convince a user to visit that page.
