Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-2237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application, Betster (PHP Betoffice) 1.0.4, suffers from both SQL Injection and Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **SQL Injection:** User-supplied data from the `id` parameter in `showprofile.php` and `categoryedit.php`, and the `username` parameter in `index.php`'s login function are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The `username` parameter in the POST request to `index.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection allowing an attacker to bypass the login mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection in the login functionality, attackers can bypass authentication controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to:
    *   Reading, inserting, or deleting database entries.
    *   Potentially compromising the underlying operating system, depending on database configuration and privileges.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Allows unauthorized access to the application's administrative or privileged functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   HTTP GET requests to `showprofile.php` and `categoryedit.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.
    *   HTTP POST request to `index.php` with a manipulated `username` parameter.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** HTTP POST request to `index.php` with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit the authentication bypass vulnerability.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection is required to exploit the vulnerabilities fully.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit code provided includes methods to send HTTP requests and to bypass the authentication process and to exploit the SQL injection on the `showprofile.php` page.
* The exploit code targets the `username` parameter with the following payload: `username=admin%27+or+%27a%27%3D%27a`. This payload creates a condition that is always true and bypasses the authentication controls in the login function.
* The exploit code performs SQL injection on the `showprofile.php` page using a crafted `id` parameter, extracting the database user and database name.
* The affected files, `showprofile.php`, `categoryedit.php`, and `index.php` were explicitly mentioned as vulnerable.
