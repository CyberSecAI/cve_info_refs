    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2015-2065",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Video Gallery plugin version 2.7 does not properly sanitize the 'vid' parameter in the admin-ajax.php request, leading to SQL injection.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion. They might also gain unauthorized access to the system or perform further attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php endpoint with a malicious SQL injection payload in the 'vid' parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress installation. No authentication is mentioned in the provided content, implying the vulnerability may be exploitable without specific privileges. It is likely that the 'action=rss' parameter is needed as well as a 'type=video' parameter.",
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerable parameter is 'vid', and the vulnerable file is 'videogalleryrss.php'. A fix was provided by the vendor by casting the 'vid' parameter to an integer using 'intval()'."
