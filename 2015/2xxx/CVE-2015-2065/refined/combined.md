##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### [Its ok feature wise but here’s some fixes](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/its-ok-feature-wise-but-heres-some-fixes/)

[t3fury](https://profiles.wordpress.org/t3fury/ "Posts by t3fury")
April 24, 2017

Out of the box feature wise its OK but i found a lot of the coding was ancient and some things were missing. I believe the devs are either lazy or they haven’t uploaded the right update to wordpress, they claim that a lot of the issues were fixed in version 3.0 that i came across like the date been november 30th -0001 (fix below) and the switch to iframe which none of them were I know this because version 3.0 is the most current one and its the one i started on, when i searched the php files all the code they claimed to have replaced was still present.
I mostly add my YouTube game play videos to my site and this is the first problem, this plugin is flash based which YouTube no longer supports making this plugin pretty much redundant for YouTube content creator until the fix i found on there forums which I will share below.
No playlist support, i found i couldn’t add any playlist to my site via this plugin. the playlist feature is for users to put together which again doesn’t work, I will try to add support for youtube playlists myself and share once it done.
Fixes
Flash to iframe Fix (remember to always backup your files in case anything goes wrong)
Find this file
wp-content/plugins/contus-video-gallery/front/views/videohome.php and open file videohome.php
Search for this code
/\*\* If browser is detect then play videos via flash player using embed code \*/
$div .= '<embed id="player" src="' . $swf . '" flashvars="baserefW=' . $this->\_siteURL . $baseref . $showplaylist . '&mtype=playerModule" width="' . $settingsData->width . '" height="' . $settingsData->height . '" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" />';
Once found replace this code with this
f (strpos ( $videoUrl, 'youtube' ) > 0) {
/\*\* Iframe code for youtube videos \*/
$videoId1 = getYoutubeVideoID ( $videoUrl );
$div='<div id="player"></div><script>var tag = document.createElement("script");tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/iframe\_api";var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);var player;function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {player = new YT.Player("player", {width: "'.$settingsData->width .'",height: "'.$settingsData->height .'",videoId: "'.$videoId1.'",playerVars: {"rel": 0,"showinfo":0,"modestbranding":0},events: {"onStateChange": onPlayerStateChange}});}var done = false;function onPlayerStateChange(event) {if (event.data == YT.PlayerState.PLAYING && !done) {currentVideoP('.$videoId.');done = true;}}</script>';
} else{
/\*\* If browser is detect then play videos via flash player using embed code \*/
$div .= '<embed id="player" src="' . $swf . '" flashvars="baserefW=' . $this->\_siteURL . $baseref . $showplaylist . '&mtype=playerModule" width="' . $settingsData->width . '" height="' . $settingsData->height . '" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" />';
}
save this file, in the same folder edit the videodetailpage.php file
Replace this code
$output .= '<div id="flashplayer"><embed src="' . $this->\_swfPath . '" flashvars="' . $flashvars . '" width="' . $width . '" height="' . $height . '" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></div>';
With this
foreach ( $fetched as $media ) {
$videourl = $media->file;
$file\_type = $media->file\_type;
$imgurl = getImagesValue ( $media->image, $file\_type, $media->amazon\_buckets, '');
}
if (strpos ( $videourl, 'youtube' ) > 0) {
$videoid = getYoutubeVideoID ( $videourl );
$output .='<div id="player"></div><script>var tag = document.createElement("script");tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/iframe\_api";var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);var player;function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {player = new YT.Player("player", {width: "'.$width.'", height:"'.$height.'",videoId: "'.$videoid.'",playerVars: {"rel": 0,"showinfo":0,"modestbranding":0},events: {"onStateChange": onPlayerStateChange}});}var done = false;function onPlayerStateChange(event) {if (event.data == YT.PlayerState.PLAYING && !done) {currentVideoP('.$videoId.');done = true;}}</script>';
} else{
$output .= '<div id="flashplayer"><embed src="' . $this->\_swfPath . '" flashvars="' . $flashvars . '" width="' . $width . '" height="' . $height . '" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></div>';
}
Save and that should fix you flash
Wrong date fix
If your videos are displaying the date as November 30th -0001
Go to this file wp-content/plugins/contus-video-gallery/admin/controllers/videosSubController.php
Find this code
//$videoData ['post\_date'] = date ( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' ); and remove the // from the front of it and save the file, this should sort out the wrong date but you will have to edit and click publish on all videos displaying the wrong date to fix them
Anyway sorry for the wall of text hope what i put helps

### [A truly terrible plugin, really badly coded](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-truly-terrible-plugin-really-badly-coded/)

I have been patiently waiting for 17 months for Apptha to update their Video Gallery plugin and every time I ask they say it will be two months.
Here was the initial feedback from our developers in December 2015 – a year later and nothing has been updated:
For starters the Player is not HTML5, but Flash-based
The Video Gallery file is 370 lines of php code (with some small html/js) and half of the file is an ugly mess of spaghetti code.
Not only this, but Apptha/Contus are doing some dark magic stuff with the loading of the actual player, which is totally undocumented and it’s badly approached.
From my quick review it seems every video file has a file type which is coded via a cryptic number – with possible values from 1 to 5.
One number defines a YouTube/DailyMotion video, another uploaded file, another custom url, legacy flash based video streaming type & embed video.
So there are various types of conditions and 4 different approaches to the video display:
from using one type of specialised tag, that is subsequently replaced via js – for the embed type
to using another for YouTube, again replaced via js
to using 3rd tag for uploaded image or flash streaming, again later replaced via js
to using a 4th tag which is similar to the YouTube tag but not quite, and again later replaced via js
A total mess.
Not to mention that the behaviour of all this is changing depending on whether the widget is loaded on mobile, or on desktop.
From what I see sometimes more than one tag is used – this specifically is not a bug, it’s called progressive enhancement and it’s needed to support various Browsers and environments.
Either way, the approach is bad even in this regard, as the lack of basic documentation & conventions within the code is annoying.
There is no basic explanation why certain decisions are made.
We had a very hard time just to apply some basic responsive styles for the player – as we had to write 30-40 lines of CSS hacks to get the player at least in a basic shape.
In short, Apptha should supply a Video Player that looks and behaves more like the one in YouTube – based on HTML5.
But even if they do, they won’t replace the underlying code of the widget – so there is a high risk, that they will send even worse/tweaked version of the widget.
