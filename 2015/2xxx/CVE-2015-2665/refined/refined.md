**Summary:**

CVE-2015-2665 is one of multiple vulnerabilities (along with CVE-2015-4342 and CVE-2015-4454) affecting Cacti, a web interface for graphing monitoring systems. This particular CVE is not explicitly detailed, however, it is mentioned as one of several vulnerabilities being fixed by the advisory. The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities present are cross-site scripting and SQL injection issues.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of these vulnerabilities is not specifically detailed in the provided content, but generally, successful exploitation of XSS could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. SQL injection could lead to unauthorized access to or modification of the database.

The attack vectors are not explicitly stated but can be inferred:
- **XSS:** Attackers would likely inject malicious scripts via vulnerable input fields or other parameters exposed through the Cacti web interface.
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers would likely inject malicious SQL code via vulnerable parameters that are passed into SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would require network access to the Cacti web interface to exploit the vulnerability. 
- They need to be able to craft malicious requests that inject either Javascript or SQL code.
- Specific user privileges needed to exploit the vulnerabilities are not specified in this document.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory is for Debian systems and mentions the specific package versions that fix the vulnerabilities in oldstable (wheezy), stable (jessie), and unstable (sid) distributions.
- The Debian Security Team handles these issues and recommends users update their cacti packages.
