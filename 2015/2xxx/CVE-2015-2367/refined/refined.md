Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Windows kernel-mode driver's (win32k.sys) improper handling of certain non-initialized values in memory within the `NtUserDisableProcessWindowFiltering` function. Specifically, a stack variable is not sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is an information disclosure vulnerability, where sensitive kernel memory addresses and other kernel information can be leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain kernel memory addresses or other sensitive kernel information, which can be used for further exploitation.
- **Bypassing Security Features:** The leaked information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass security features like ASLR.
- **Potential Elevation of Privilege:** While this vulnerability itself doesn't allow arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, the leaked information can be used in combination with another vulnerability to achieve code execution at SYSTEM level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to run a specifically crafted application.
- The attacker needs to be able to combine this with another vulnerability for code execution at system level.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `NtUserDisableProcessWindowFiltering` function.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows Kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.
