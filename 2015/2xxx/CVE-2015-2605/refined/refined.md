- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly sanitize the path of files in the handling of the MoveFile endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization of file paths leading to directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A remote attacker can read server configuration files. This exfiltrated information can then be used to access the system with the privileges of the clover server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be authenticated, but an authentication bypass is known.
