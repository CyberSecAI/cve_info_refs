Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-2797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `login-cgi` component of Airties routers. This occurs when handling HTTP queries with long `redirect` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability is present. The `login-cgi` script does not properly validate the length of the `redirect` parameter, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router. In the provided exploit code, the attacker gains a reverse root shell on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/login` endpoint.
- **Malicious `redirect` Parameter:** The malicious code is injected into the `redirect` parameter of the POST request, exceeding the buffer's capacity and overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable router. This usually means the router must be accessible over the network (LAN or WAN depending on configuration) or the attacker is on the local network.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is present before authentication, so no valid login credentials are required.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must be able to construct and send a POST request.

**Additional Details**
- The exploit provided includes shellcode tailored for the MIPS architecture and specific addresses for libc functions. This suggests that the exploit is very specific to the target firmware and that address randomization is not implemented.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Airties router models, including Air6372, Air5760, Air5750, Air5650TT, Air5453, Air5444TT, Air5443, Air5442, Air5343, Air5342, and Air5341
- The exploit was tested on AirTies_Air5650v3TT_FW_1.0.2.0.bin.
- The exploit does not require authentication.
