  "cveId": "CVE-2015-2310",
  "description": "Integer overflow in layout.c++ in Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.4.1.1 and 0.5.x before 0.5.1.1 allows remote peers to cause a denial of service or possibly obtain sensitive information from memory via a crafted message, related to pointer validation.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Integer overflow in pointer validation within `layout.c++`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted message can trigger an integer overflow, causing a message to appear as having an extremely large list. If the application attempts to read this list, it can lead to a segfault, denial of service. In some cases if the application does not segfault it may treat arbitrary parts of memory as input, potentially leading to exfiltration of secrets if the application passes this data back to the user.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Crafted message sent by a remote peer."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted message to a peer."
