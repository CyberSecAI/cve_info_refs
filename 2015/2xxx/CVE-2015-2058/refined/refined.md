Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-2058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of UTF-8 strings when normalizing a Jabber Identifier (JID) in jabberd2. Specifically, jabberd2 truncates the JID data to 1023 bytes without validating if the truncation resulted in valid UTF-8 before passing the data to the libidn library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper UTF-8 Handling:** Truncation can split a multi-byte UTF-8 character, leading to an invalid UTF-8 sequence.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** jabberd2 does not verify the validity of UTF-8 after truncation.
*   **Buffer Over-read:** When an invalid UTF-8 sequence is passed to `libidn`, it can read past the intended buffer boundary. This is a consequence of the input not being valid UTF-8 as required by `libidn`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Information Disclosure:** By crafting a specific JID with an unterminated multi-byte UTF-8 sequence, an attacker can cause `libidn` to read data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially disclosing sensitive information from the server's memory. This includes data after the resource buffer, which may contain parts of the domain and node components of the JID. The content of leaked memory could vary depending on the server's architecture and other factors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Client or Server:** A malicious remote client or a remote server can send a specially crafted JID string to jabberd2 that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send XMPP messages to the jabberd2 server.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker must be able to generate JID strings with specific properties (longer than 1023 bytes, ending with a partial multi-byte sequence) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is located within the `jid_prep_pieces` function.
*   The vulnerability arises due to a combination of truncation and a lack of validation before passing the data to `stringprep_xmpp_resourceprep`.
*   The `stringprep` functions from `libidn` require valid UTF-8 input and may exhibit unexpected behavior when processing invalid UTF-8 sequences, as shown here, reading beyond the specified buffer.
*   The Github issue #85 on jabberd2 repository provides a concrete example using specific characters and a crafted resource string to trigger information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability is present in jabberd2 version 2.3.2 and below.
