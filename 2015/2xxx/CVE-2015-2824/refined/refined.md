The provided content relates to CVE-2015-2824. It describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the Simple Ads Manager WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. The plugin directly incorporates data from $_POST, $_GET, and $_REQUEST variables into SQL queries without escaping or validating them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The following SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified:
1.  **`sam-ajax.php`**: Unsanitized `hits` parameter in the `sam_ajax_sam_hits` action leads to SQL injection. The values from the `hits` array are directly concatenated into an INSERT statement.
2.  **`sam-ajax-admin.php`**:
    *   Unsanitized `cstr` parameter in the `sam_ajax_load_posts` action leads to SQL injection. The value of `cstr` is directly injected into the `FIND_IN_SET` clause of a SQL query.
    *   Unsanitized `searchTerm` parameter in the `sam_ajax_load_combo_data` action leads to SQL injection. The value of `searchTerm` is directly injected into a `LIKE` clause of a SQL query.
    *   Unsanitized parameters `subscriber`, `contributor`, `author`, `editor`, `admin`, and `sadmin` in the `sam_ajax_load_users` action lead to SQL injection. These values are directly used within a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other information stored in the WordPress database
*   Modify or delete data in the database.
*   Potentially gain complete control over the WordPress site by inserting malicious code into database fields or creating a new admin user.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server via database functions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors include sending malicious HTTP POST or GET requests with crafted parameters to the following files:
*   `wp-content/plugins/simple-ads-manager/sam-ajax.php`
*   `wp-content/plugins/simple-ads-manager/sam-ajax-admin.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerabilities in `sam-ajax.php`.
*   An attacker needs to be at least an administrator to exploit the vulnerabilities in `sam-ajax-admin.php` as it requires accessing the WordPress admin dashboard to perform the malicious requests.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
