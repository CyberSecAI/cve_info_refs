{
  "CVE-2015-3456": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) emulation within QEMU.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking when handling FIFO buffer access while processing certain FDC commands"
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged guest user could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.",
    "Attack vectors": "A privileged user within a guest virtual machine sending crafted FDC commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires a privileged user within a guest virtual machine, with the ability to send crafted FDC commands to the emulated floppy disk controller. Access to the virtual floppy drive is required but not the use of a virtual floppy disk image. For some configurations like Xen, access to an emulated floppy device is sufficient."
