Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Thermostat web application stored database authentication credentials in a world-readable configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive database credentials in a configuration file accessible to all users on the system.
- **World-Readable File:** The configuration file, containing the credentials, had permissions that allowed any local user to read it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access and Modification of JVM Data:**  A local user could retrieve the credentials and use them to access and modify data from monitored Java Virtual Machines (JVMs).
- **Control over Connected JVMs:**  The attacker could potentially perform actions on JVMs connected to the Thermostat application.
- **System Compromise:** The vulnerability could lead to a compromise of the Thermostat system and the connected JVMs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the system running the Thermostat web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable Thermostat application is installed.
- **Basic File Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files on the system.
