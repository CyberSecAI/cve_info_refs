Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Incorrect cache handling. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how Drupal 7 caches content, leading to unauthorized exposure of private content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate access control**: The caching mechanism does not properly enforce access control, which results in private content intended for "user 1" being accessible to other, non-privileged users.
- **Cache poisoning:** This improper caching behavior can be viewed as a form of cache poisoning where sensitive information is inadvertently placed in the cache that is accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized users can gain access to private content that they are not intended to see. This could include sensitive user information, confidential documents, or other protected data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User access:** The attack vector involves an attacker being able to access cached content that they are not authorized to view through normal means.
- The vulnerability is within the caching mechanism of the Drupal 7 application itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be a user on the Drupal 7 system, but they would not need any specific privileges beyond being a non-privileged user.
- They would need to be able to access the cached content that has been exposed through the flawed caching mechanism.
