- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the memory allocator of libaxl.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory corruption, and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: Parsing a specially crafted XML document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted XML data to an application using libaxl, potentially over a network and without authentication.
