As suggested at the end of the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/16/17> post, the
approach you're using (writing to oss-security about a case where the
source-code details of the bug remain private) typically should be
accompanied by a link between the oss-security thread and any later
disclosure.
