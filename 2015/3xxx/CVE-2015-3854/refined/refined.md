## Vulnerability Analysis for CVE-2015-3854

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `PowerNotificationWarnings.java` file within the Android SystemUI package.
*   The `PowerNotificationWarnings` component registers a dynamic broadcast receiver without proper permission checks. This receiver listens for several actions related to battery saving mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Permission Leakage:** The core issue is a permission leakage. An application, without holding the required `DEVICE_POWER` system permission, can trigger actions that should be restricted to system-level processes.
*   **Unprotected Broadcast Receiver:** The dynamic broadcast receiver in `PowerNotificationWarnings` doesn't enforce any permission checks on the incoming broadcast intents. Specifically, it listens for `PNW.stopSaver` action.
*   **Direct API Call via Broadcast:**  By sending a broadcast with action `PNW.stopSaver`, an attacker application can indirectly call `PowerManager.setPowerSaveMode(false)`, which should require the `DEVICE_POWER` permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disabling Battery Saver:** A malicious application can disable battery saver mode without any user interaction. This can potentially lead to increased battery drain.
*   **Dismissing Notifications:** The vulnerability also allows an attacker to dismiss low battery notifications. This prevents user awareness of low battery state, which could be used in conjunction with other attacks that increase power usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device can send a crafted broadcast intent with the action `PNW.stopSaver`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the Android device.
*   No special permissions are required by the malicious application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is within the `PowerNotificationWarnings.java` file, specifically within the `Receiver` class. The `onReceive` method lacks permission checks for specific actions.
*   The `PNW.stopSaver` action triggers the `setSaverMode(false)` method, which ultimately calls `PowerManager.setPowerSaveMode(false)`. This last method is protected by the `DEVICE_POWER` permission, which is bypassed through the broadcast vulnerability.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a broadcast intent with action `PNW.stopSaver`.

**Mitigation:**

*   The suggested mitigations include using a local broadcast mechanism, which would prevent other applications from sending the malicious broadcast, or adding permission checks to the dynamic receiver.
*   The official fix is available at the provided link: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/05e0705177d2078fa9f940ce6df723312cfab976](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/05e0705177d2078fa9f940ce6df723312cfab976)
    This commit seems to limit the intents to system user only.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Android 5.x is specifically mentioned as being affected. The tested devices were Nexus 6 and Nexus 7 running Android 5.1.1.

**Timeline:**

*   2015.05.06: Initial report
*   2015.05.08: Acknowledged by Android Security Team
*   2015.06.01: Bug fixed internally
*   2015.07.24: CVE requested and assigned
*   2016.05.26: Public disclosure

In summary, CVE-2015-3854 describes a permission leakage in Android 5.x where a malicious app could disable battery saver mode and dismiss low battery notifications without the necessary permissions. This is achieved by exploiting an unprotected broadcast receiver in `PowerNotificationWarnings.java`.
