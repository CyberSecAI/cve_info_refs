[CVE-2015-3091 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3091)

#### Description

Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172 do not properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3092.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-3077, CVE-2015-3078, CVE-2015-3080, CVE-2015-3082,
CVE-2015-3083, CVE-2015-3084, CVE-2015-3085, CVE-2015-3086, CVE-2015-3087,
CVE-2015-3088, CVE-2015-3089, CVE-2015-3090, CVE-2015-3093)

A security bypass flaw was found in flash-plugin that could lead to the
disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2015-3079)

Two memory information leak flaws were found in flash-plugin that could
allow an attacker to potentially bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization) protection, and make it easier to exploit other flaws.
(CVE-2015-3091, CVE-2015-3092)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.460.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=930677#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2015-05-13 07:25:16 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-3085  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the BrokerCreateFile method. An attacker can force BrokerCreateFile to traverse the path of the output file, allowing the file to be written anywhere on disk. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code at medium integrity.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Issues in DefineBitsLossless and DefineBitsLossless2 leads to using uninitialized memory while rendering a picture. This is caused by the returned value of a zlib function not properly checked.

VERSION
Chrome version 41.0.2272.101, Flash 17.0.0.134 (the code below comes from flash player standalone exe 17.0.0.134)
Operating System: Win 7 x64 SP1

REPRODUCTION CASE

Compile the provided poc with flex sdk:
mxmlc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -compress=false -target-player 15.0 -swf-version 25 XBitmapGif.as

And change the bytes in the DefineBitsLossless2 tag, at offset 0x228:
 14 00 14 00 78 to 14 00 14 00 41

To get a DefineBitsLossless tag, change the byte at offset 0x220:
 09 47 00 00 00 to 05 47 00 00 00

Load the provided pocs and see the pointers partially disclosed.

When handling such tags, Flash first allocates a buffer according to the picture's width and height but does not initialize it. If the compressed data stream is corrupted, the zlib function just returns an invalid token and Flash leaves the uninitialized buffer as is.

Look at sub_54732C:

.text:0054746C loc_54746C:
.text:0054746C                 mov     ecx, [esi]
.text:0054746E                 push    0
.text:00547470                 push    0
.text:00547472                 push    eax
.text:00547473                 push    [ebp+var_10]
.text:00547476                 push    [ebp+var_14]
.text:00547479                 push    [ebp+var_C]
.text:0054747C                 call    sub_545459              ; allocate a buffer of 4 * 14h * 14h = 640h
.text:00547481                 cmp     [ebp+var_1], 0
.text:00547485                 mov     ecx, [esi]
.text:00547487                 setnz   al
.text:0054748A                 mov     [ecx+58h], al
...
.text:005474DE loc_5474DE:
.text:005474DE                 lea     eax, [ebp+var_50]
.text:005474E1                 push    0
.text:005474E3                 push    eax
.text:005474E4                 call    xinflate                ; inflate the buffer, but there's no error check?
.text:005474E9                 pop     ecx                     ; thus we can return 0xFFFFFFFD in eax with a corrupt stream
.text:005474EA                 pop     ecx
.text:005474EB                 cmp     eax, 1
.text:005474EE                 jz      short loc_5474FB
.text:005474F0                 test    eax, eax
.text:005474F2                 jnz     short loc_54753A        ; which will skip the buffer initialization

Reading this data back is not straightforward. For a DefineBitsLossless tag, we can read values like 0xFFXXYYZZ. For a DefineBitsLossless2 tag an operation is performed on the pixels so we can only read f(pixel). That function is handled by sub_4CD3B0 and uses a hardcoded table. By conbining both the DefineBitsLossless and DefineBitsLossless2 tags I'm quite convinced we can guess a full pointer.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
