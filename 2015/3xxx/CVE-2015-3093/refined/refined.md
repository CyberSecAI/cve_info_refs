  "CVE-2015-3093": {
    "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172 allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3078, CVE-2015-3089, and CVE-2015-3090.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by issues in `DefineBitsLossless` and `DefineBitsLossless2` tags within Adobe Flash Player, which leads to using uninitialized memory while rendering a picture due to a missing check on the returned value of a zlib function during decompression of image data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of compressed data stream",
        "Use of uninitialized memory",
	"Missing error check on zlib function return values"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this to achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service due to memory corruption. Specifically, by crafting malicious SWF files with corrupted compressed image data an attacker can bypass intended restrictions and write files anywhere on disk, potentially leading to code execution with medium integrity.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this by creating specially crafted SWF files which, when loaded by a user, triggers the vulnerability.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SWF file and have a victim load it through a browser or standalone flash player."
