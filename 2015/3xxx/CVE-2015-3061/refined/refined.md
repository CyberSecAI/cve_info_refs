Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the `ANMatchString` method of Adobe Reader's JavaScript API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core issue is a bypass of JavaScript API restrictions. Specifically, the `ANMatchString` method does not properly enforce the intended security constraints leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could result in complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious PDF document. This PDF would contain specially designed JavaScript instructions that leverage the vulnerability in the `ANMatchString` method to bypass security restrictions. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. A user must open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker needs the ability to:
1.  Create a specially crafted PDF file with malicious JavaScript.
2.  Deliver this PDF to a potential victim. This could be done through email, malicious website, or other delivery methods.
3.  Entice the victim to open the crafted PDF file in a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader.
