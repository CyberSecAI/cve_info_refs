{
  "CVE-2015-3214": {
    "description": "QEMU before 2.3.1 does not distinguish between read lengths and write lengths, which might allow users on the guest VM to execute arbitrary code on the switch by triggering use of an invalid index.",
    "root_cause": "The programmable interrupt timer (PIT) controller in QEMU does not correctly validate the channel number when performing IO writes to the device controller, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access in the pit_ioport_read function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access",
      "Heap overflow",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A user on the guest virtual machine could read uninitialized qemu memory on the switch and run arbitrary code, leading to memory corruption, information leak, or arbitrary code execution on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing PIT Mode/Command register with an invalid channel number",
        "Guest VM can trigger out-of-bounds memory access by specifying addr to be IOPORT_PIT_CHANNEL0+3"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user in the guest virtual machine.",
         "more_info": "The vulnerability lies in the pit_ioport_read function within QEMU. When reading from the PIT Mode/Command register, the channel number is not correctly validated. By specifying an address that leads to an out-of-bounds index, it is possible to read and write memory beyond the intended allocation. The vulnerability also leaks information, by returning certain memory contents back to the guest."
