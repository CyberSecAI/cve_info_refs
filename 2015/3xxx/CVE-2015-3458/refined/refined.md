Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2015-1397, CVE-2015-1398, and CVE-2015-1399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is not a single flaw but a chain of several vulnerabilities in the Magento e-commerce platform. This chain allows unauthenticated users to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerabilities lie in how Magento handles module, controller, and action requests, combined with flawed authentication checks and the ability to manipulate SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Controller Injection:**
    *   Magento uses a dynamic controller loading mechanism based on URL path information.
    *   The system appends "Adminhtml" to module names when an admin context is intended.
    *   Vulnerability: It's possible to bypass admin authentication by manipulating the URL and injecting a controller name to load an admin-context module in a user context, exploiting the lack of proper admin session validation in this scenario.
    *   However, a whitelist restricts injectable modules to only those that exist in both the admin and user context.

2.  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   Magento doesn't directly block unauthenticated users from accessing protected controllers. Instead, it redirects them to a login controller.
    *   Vulnerability: A "forwarded" parameter in the request bypasses the authentication check, allowing access to any admin module, regardless of the user's authentication status. This is due to a control flow logic error where the system checks the forwarded parameter AFTER detecting no authentication. This expands the attack surface.

3.  **Template Filter Manipulation and Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   The `Cms_Wysiwyg` controller's `directiveAction` loads images using a path specified in the `___directive` parameter.
    *   The `filter()` function, processes input with the format `{{FUNC_NAME PARAM_NAME=PARAM_VALUE}}` and attempts to call the function `[FUNC_NAME]Directive`
    *   The `blockDirective()` function can create Magento block classes where the class name can be controlled by the attacker `Mage_X_Block_Y`, combined with the reflection loading mechanism, which leads to a LFI.
    *   The `setDataUsingMethod()` function allows an attacker to call any method in a block class starting with the `set` prefix.
    *   The `blockDirective()` function after initialization, lets the attacker call any method from the block class without arguments.
    *   The combination of these capabilities allows the attacker to instantiate a block with controlled properties, thus achieving LFI.

4.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid` class's `getCsvFile()` method exports data to a CSV file, and it offers filtering based on conditions.
    *    The conditions parser replaces a field name if a parameter `field_expr` is included in the filter dictionary with the provided value.
    *  The `Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid_Column_Filter_Range::getValue()` returns the condition dictionary from the request as is if the dictionary has  `from` and `to` keys
    *  The attacker can control the entire SQL query using the injection point, due to the usage of PDO, which supports multiple queries in the same statement, and the `PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES` setting set to `true`.

5.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Phar Wrapper:**
    *   The `Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend` class has `setScriptPath()` and `fetchView()` methods.
    *   `fetchView()` includes a template file without checking its extension, if it can be found using the `_path` variable.
    *   The  `renderView()` calls `setScriptPath()` before `fetchView()`, preventing the attacker from calling it directly with a controlled path and escaping the  `./app/design` path.
     *   The `phar://` wrapper can be used in a scenario that normally expects a filename, thus bypassing the `is_readable()` file system check and executing php code that is part of the archive's stub when it is included via `fetchView()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Full control of the Magento store, including the database, leading to:
    *   Credit card and personal data theft.
    *   Administrative access to the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The ability to access and export sensitive data.
*   **Malware Installation:** The ability to upload and execute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends malicious HTTP requests to the Magento server, manipulating URL parameters and post data.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Magento server.
*   **Knowledge of Magento Vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to know about the described chain of vulnerabilities.

In summary, this article provides detailed information on a complex vulnerability in Magento, where an attacker combines multiple weaknesses to achieve RCE, emphasizing the importance of applying the patch SUPEE-5344.
