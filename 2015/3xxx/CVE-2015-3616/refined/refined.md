The provided content is related to CVE-2015-3616.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in FortiManager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerabilities include:
  * Escalation of Privileges
  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  * SQL Query Execution
  * SQL Injection
  * Arbitrary File Download

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges, execute arbitrary scripts, perform SQL queries/injections, or download files.

**Attack vectors:** The content does not provide specific attack vectors. However, given the vulnerabilities, it can be inferred that the attack vectors would involve manipulating user input to exploit XSS, using SQL injection to run arbitrary SQL queries, exploiting insecure file handling for downloads and potentially bypassing authorization mechanisms to achieve privilege escalation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable FortiManager system. The specific capabilities needed for each vulnerability is not described in detail, but could include having a valid user account (for XSS), or the ability to send specially crafted requests to the server (for SQL injection and arbitrary file download).
