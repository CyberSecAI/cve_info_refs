### CVE-2015-3225

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `normalize_params()` method within the Rack library, a modular Ruby webserver interface. Specifically, the issue is due to a lack of proper handling of deeply nested parameters in incoming requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  A lack of a depth limit when parsing parameters. This causes a stack overflow if the parameter depth is too great.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Carefully crafted requests with excessively nested parameters can cause a `SystemStackError`. This error crashes the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Network Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via network requests that contain deeply nested parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by sending malicious network requests to a server running an affected version of Rack.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Rack library before the fixed versions.
- Patches were provided for versions 1.5 and 1.6.
- The issue is triggered by the `normalize_params()` function when handling nested parameters.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of `rubygem-rack` prior to 1.5.4 and 1.6.2.
- Specific versions affected include those used by openSUSE (1.3, 1.4, 1.5), Debian, and Red Hat.

**Fixed Versions:**
- `rubygem-rack` versions 1.5.4 and 1.6.2 and later

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the fixed versions of `rubygem-rack` (1.5.4 or 1.6.2 or later) is recommended.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Tomek Rabczak from the NCC Group.
- There are no feasible workarounds other than upgrading.
- Patches were provided to aid users who cannot immediately upgrade.

This information is more detailed than the original CVE description which reads: "lib/rack/utils.rb in Rack before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.2, as used with Ruby on Rails 3.x and 4.x and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (SystemStackError) via a request with a large parameter depth."
