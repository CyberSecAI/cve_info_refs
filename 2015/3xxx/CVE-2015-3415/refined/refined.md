2. **Content from rhn.redhat.com_284a8d4d_20250124_235235.html**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper implementation of comparison operators in SQLite's `sqlite3VdbeExec()` function.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Failure to properly handle comparison operators.
    *  **Impact:** A local attacker could submit a specially crafted CHECK statement that would crash the SQLite process or have other unspecified impacts.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Local.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access to the system. Ability to submit crafted SQL statements.

3. **Content from support.apple.com_7ff960c3_20250124_235254.html**

4. **Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_881ba0a9_20250126_043708.html**
    *   **Root Cause:**  SQLite's `sqlite3VXPrintf()` function did not properly handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of precision and width values during floating-point conversions.
    *   **Impact:**  A local attacker could submit a specially crafted SELECT statement that would crash the SQLite process or have other unspecified impacts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Local.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access, ability to submit crafted SQL statements.

5. **Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_6de9ddd9_20250126_043706.html**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Improper implementation of comparison operators in SQLite's `sqlite3VdbeExec()` function, leading to an invalid free().
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Incorrect implementation of comparison operators.
    *   **Impact:**  A local attacker could submit a specially crafted CHECK statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Local.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access, ability to submit crafted SQL statements.

6. **Content from www.sqlite.org_c504f888_20250124_235256.html**
     *   **Root Cause:** Comparison operators in SQLite incorrectly manipulated the `MEM_Dyn` flag on registers.
     *   **Weaknesses:**  Improper flag handling during comparison operations.
     *  **Impact:** Undisclosed impacts due to incorrect register flag handling.
     *  **Attack Vectors:** Not directly specified.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Not directly specified.

7.  **Content from www.ubuntu.com_6d4495c4_20250124_235253.html**
    *   **Root Cause:** Multiple issues in SQLite including incorrect handling of skip-scan optimization, dequoting of collation-sequence names, comparison operators, and printf precision during floating-point conversions.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Multiple flaws related to query parsing, optimization, and type conversion.
    *   **Impact:** Applications using SQLite may crash, resulting in a denial of service, and possibly allow execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Not directly specified.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft specific SQL queries.
