- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An insufficient comparison issue existed in Wi-Fi manager's evaluation of known access point advertisements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient comparison of security parameters in Wi-Fi access point advertisements.
- **Impact of exploitation:** iOS devices may auto-associate with untrusted access points advertising a known ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier) but with a downgraded security type.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can set up a malicious Wi-Fi access point that advertises a known ESSID with weaker security settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within range to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal, and needs to know the ESSID of a known/trusted network.
