Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Docker Engine's insufficient restrictions on volume mounts within a container. Specifically, it allows a container to mount volumes that override files in the `/proc` directory of the host system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Volume Mounts:**  Docker allows container volumes to overwrite `/proc` files on the host.
- **LSM Profile Escalation:** Overriding files in `/proc` enables a malicious user within a container to set arbitrary policies for Linux Security Modules (LSM). This includes:
  - Setting an unconfined profile under AppArmor.
  - Setting a `docker_t` profile for processes managed by SELinux.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating LSM profiles, an attacker can effectively elevate their privileges from within the container to gain control over the host operating system.
- **Host System Manipulation:** This can lead to significant manipulation of the host system, including modification of system settings, access to sensitive information, and execution of arbitrary code on the host.
- **Security Policy Bypass:** The ability to set arbitrary LSM policies allows the attacker to bypass existing security restrictions enforced by AppArmor or SELinux.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Docker Image:** The primary attack vector is a crafted Docker image.
- **Volume Mount Manipulation:** The attacker creates a malicious image with volume mount configuration that overrides `/proc` files.
- **Container Execution:** The malicious container, when executed, mounts the malicious volumes, altering the LSM profiles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker requires the ability to run Docker containers on the target system.
- **Malicious Image Creation:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a malicious Docker image.
- **Understanding of LSMs:** A basic understanding of how Linux Security Modules work is useful for crafting effective exploits.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Docker Engine versions prior to 1.6.1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Windisch of the Docker Security Team.
*   SUSE rates this issue as having a "low" severity.
*   The fix involves restricting the ability to mount volumes on `/proc` and `/` and updating the AppArmor policy to prevent mounting of `/sys`.
*   The vulnerability was also referenced in SUSE Bugzilla entries #930235 and #945060.

This information is more comprehensive than the official CVE description, which only states:

> Docker Engine before 1.6.1 allows local users to set arbitrary Linux Security Modules (LSM) and docker_t policies via an image that allows volumes to override files in /proc.
