Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3443:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Thycotic Secret Server. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode password values when they are retrieved and displayed in the basic dashboard view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores user-provided data (password values) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the stored password field.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** When the password is retrieved from the server via an AJAX call and added to the page's DOM, it is not encoded, leading to execution of the injected script when the password mask is toggled (revealing/hiding password).
*   **Inconsistent Encoding:** The vulnerability only exists in the basic dashboard. The advanced dashboard correctly encodes the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session when they view a specially crafted password.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker can use the JavaScript code to steal the victim's session cookies or other sensitive information. In a more advanced attack, the attacker could steal other passwords the victim has access to.
*   **Account Takeover:** By stealing the session cookie, an attacker could potentially impersonate the victim and perform actions on their behalf, possibly gaining access to additional secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Password Injection:** An attacker creates a new password entry (or modifies an existing one) with the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **User Interaction:** A legitimate user with access to the malicious password entry toggles the password mask in the basic dashboard, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Secret Server Access:** The attacker must have an account in the Secret Server application with the ability to create or modify secret entries.
*   **Basic Dashboard Usage:** The attack is specifically triggered within the applicationâ€™s basic dashboard view.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Secret Server versions 8.6.000000 to 8.8.000004.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2015-02-19, reported to vendor on 2015-02-20, and a patch was released the same day.
*   The provided content includes a sample payload: `"Compass Security<script>alert("Compass Security")</script>"`.
*   The server response exposes a `Content-Security-Policy`, but it does not prevent the XSS attack due to the usage of `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive.
