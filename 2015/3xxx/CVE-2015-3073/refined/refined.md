Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3073:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `AFParseDate` JavaScript API of Adobe Acrobat and Reader. Specifically, it's a bypass of Javascript API restrictions.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper restrictions on the `AFParseDate` function.
    *   The ability to use JavaScript in a crafted PDF document to execute arbitrary code due to the bypass.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A specially crafted PDF document is required.
    *   The user must open the malicious PDF file for the attack to be successful. This requires user interaction.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to create and distribute a malicious PDF file.
    *   The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit utilizes the `AFParseDate` function with a crafted JavaScript payload.
*   The JavaScript code defines a getter that manipulates the `Collab` object and the `app` object (simulating a privileged context), then it calls `CBSharedReviewIfOfflineDialog` which is vulnerable.
*   The provided exploit code uses `Collab.uriPutData`, suggesting the vulnerability can be used to write data using URI objects (likely writing a crafted file into a file path).
*   The exploit.js code provided also suggests that `updaternotifications.dll` is used as a target for code execution, if the dll is located in either the same directory of the Acrobat executable, or the same directory of the opened document. This allows the attacker to achieve code execution by exploiting the fact that the vulnerable function loads the mentioned dll.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 10.x before 10.1.14 and 11.x before 11.0.11 on Windows and macOS.
*   The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID `19252`.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

CVE-2015-3073 is a JavaScript API restriction bypass vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. By exploiting the way `AFParseDate` handles specially crafted JavaScript within a malicious PDF, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. User interaction (opening the malicious PDF) is required for successful exploitation.
