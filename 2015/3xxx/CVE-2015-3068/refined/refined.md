Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Adobe Reader handles the `app.Monitors` method in JavaScript. Specifically, it's a bypass of JavaScript API restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **JavaScript API Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass intended restrictions on the execution of JavaScript APIs within Adobe Reader. This allows attackers to circumvent security measures designed to prevent malicious script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This level of access can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF:** Attackers can craft a malicious PDF document containing specifically designed JavaScript instructions to trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Malicious Webpage:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by visiting a malicious webpage containing the malicious PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely, needing no physical access to the target system.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to create a PDF document with the necessary malicious JavaScript code to bypass the API restrictions.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, meaning the victim needs to either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage which loads the file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Reader and Acrobat updates released on May 12, 2015.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific Digital Vaccine filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
