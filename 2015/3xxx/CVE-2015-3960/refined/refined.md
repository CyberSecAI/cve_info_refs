The provided content is related to CVE-2015-3960.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The firmware contains hard-coded RSA private keys and certificate files used for SSH and HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the device by using the hard-coded RSA private keys to impersonate the server, leading to unauthorized access to the device and its functions.

**Attack vectors:** Remote network access via SSH or HTTPS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the device. The CVSS v2 score indicates that the attack complexity is medium, suggesting that some specific knowledge of the system and its vulnerabilities would be needed. The confidentiality impact is partial, as the attacker could gain some confidential information through the compromised connection.
