Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-3060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies within the `indexOfNextEssential` method of Adobe Reader's JavaScript API.
* By crafting a malicious PDF with specific JavaScript instructions, the intended restrictions on the JavaScript API can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **API Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent the intended limitations placed on the JavaScript API within Adobe Reader. This suggests a flaw in how the API's security mechanisms are enforced.
* **Code Execution:** The bypass allows for arbitrary code execution, which is a critical security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's system. This would give attackers complete control over the user's machine, allowing for malware installation, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious PDF File:** A specially crafted PDF document containing malicious JavaScript code is the primary attack vector.
* **Malicious Web Page:** The user could be lured to a malicious webpage that would exploit the vulnerability upon opening or interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote Attacker:** Attackers can be remote, meaning they do not need physical access to the victim's system.
* **Crafted PDF:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a PDF document containing specific malicious Javascript code.
* **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious webpage that initiates the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This CVE is one of many Javascript API restriction bypasses patched by Adobe in the APSB15-10 bulletin.
*   The vulnerability is credited to Simon Zuckerbraun from HP Zero Day Initiative
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19415'].
