Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3269:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the processing of XML External Entity (XXE) requests within the Apache Flex BlazeDS library. This library is used by multiple products from different vendors (VMware, Adobe, HP, Cisco).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The affected software fails to properly sanitize or restrict the processing of XML documents, allowing an attacker to inject external entities.
- **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity References:** The XML parser does not properly restrict the definition of external entities within the XML document. Specifically it does not prevent the parser from accessing URIs defined in the XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the affected system. This is achieved by forcing the XML parser to access and embed the content of external URIs back into the XML document, which can then be exfiltrated.
- The disclosed information is in the context of the user running the affected service (e.g., fmserver in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller or other server processes in other products)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending a specially crafted XML request to the vulnerable service. The attack vector is typically over HTTP or other network protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network requests to the vulnerable service.
- **No Authentication:** In some cases, as indicated in the Cisco advisory for Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller, authentication may not be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

Multiple vendors and products are affected as they utilize the vulnerable Apache Flex BlazeDS library. This includes:

- **VMware:**
  - vCenter Server (versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.5)
  - vCloud Director (versions 5.5, 5.6, 9.0.x, 9.1.0.x)
  - Horizon View (versions 5.0, 6.0)
- **Adobe:**
  - LiveCycle Data Services (versions 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 4.5, 4.6.2, 4.7)
  - ColdFusion (versions 10, 11)
- **HP:**
  - Operations Manager i (OMi) (versions 10.0, 10.01)
  - Business Service Manager (BSM) (versions 9.x to 9.26)
- **Cisco:**
  - Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller

**Mitigation:**

- Vendor-specific patches and updates are available to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to apply the appropriate updates.

**Additional details from the documents:**

- The vulnerability is related to the improper parsing of crafted XML entities.
- The vulnerability is described as an important security issue with a CVSS base score of 5.0 or 7.5, depending on the source and specific product.
- Credit for reporting the vulnerability is given to Matthias Kaiser of Code White GmbH and others.
