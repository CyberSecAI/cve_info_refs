Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An insufficient check in the phpBB code allowed users of the Google Chrome browser to be redirected to external domains. This occurred when a malicious URL was provided by a third party, such as during login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where the application redirects users to an arbitrary URL. The lack of proper validation on the redirect URL was the root cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing/Malware:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites. This could lead to phishing attacks (stealing credentials) or malware distribution (infecting users' systems).
*   **Loss of User Trust:** If users are redirected to unexpected websites, they may lose trust in the forum.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker provides a malicious URL containing the external redirect target. This URL could be embedded in a link on the forum or disguised in other ways.
*   **Third-Party Manipulation:** A malicious third party could craft these malicious URLs, making the attack more widespread.
*   **Chrome Browser:** The vulnerability was specifically noted to affect Google Chrome users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Post Links:** Attackers would likely need the ability to post links within the forum (e.g. in a post or as a parameter during login).
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the redirect vulnerability to craft a working malicious URL.
*   **No special privileges needed:** This is a client-side vulnerability that could be triggered by any user.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in phpBB versions 3.0.14 and 3.1.4.
*   The fix involves checking if the redirect URL contains the board URL before redirecting the user.
*   The commit [1a3350619f428d9d69d196c52128727e27ef2f04](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/commit/1a3350619f428d9d69d196c52128727e27ef2f04) includes the code changes to address this vulnerability.
*   The fix also includes adding tests to ensure the vulnerability is properly fixed.
*   The `redirect()` function in `/phpBB/includes/functions.php` was modified to ensure the redirect goes to the full board URL plus a slash and that it fails when redirecting to an insecure URL.
*   The function now verifies that the provided url contains the board's URL.
*   The fix ensures that redirects only happen to the board's domain unless the redirect check has been disabled.
