Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of multi-keyword cipherstrings within the `mod_nss` module. This incorrect parsing leads to the advertisement of an unexpected list of ciphers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Cipher String Parsing:** The core issue is the flawed logic used to interpret cipher strings that contain multiple keywords. This can result in a different set of ciphers being offered than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Unintended Ciphers:** An attacker might be able to negotiate a connection using a cipher suite that the server administrator did not intend to enable or expose. This may lead to weaker encryption being used, or the use of potentially vulnerable cipher suites.
- **Potential for Downgrade Attacks:** An attacker could potentially force the server to use weaker ciphers that are vulnerable to attacks by manipulating the list of ciphers.
- The vulnerability can lead to an unexpected ciphers list being advertised.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a TLS/SSL handshake. An attacker can attempt to negotiate a connection using ciphers they are not meant to have access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a TLS/SSL connection with the vulnerable server.
- They need the ability to manipulate the cipher suites proposed during the TLS/SSL handshake.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `2d1650900f4d47dc43400d826c0f7e1a7c5229b8` in the mod_nss git repository.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `mod_nss-1.0.11-4.fc22` for Fedora 22
- The vulnerability does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.

The provided information aligns with the general description of CVE-2015-3277, which relates to incorrect multi-keyword mode cipher string parsing in `mod_nss`.
