Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3994:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper output neutralization for logs, specifically, the SAP HANA XS Engine fails to sanitize input before writing it to log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs):**  The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data before writing it into log files. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary log entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Log Corruption:** Attackers can inject arbitrary data into log files, potentially corrupting them.
- **Misleading Administrators:**  The injected log entries could be crafted to mislead administrators, potentially hiding malicious activity or creating false alarms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:**  The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable SAP HANA XS Engine. Specifically, the application "grant.xsfunc" at `/testApps/grantAccess/grant.xscfunc` is targeted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the SAP HANA system.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the SAP HANA system to send the malicious HTTP requests.
