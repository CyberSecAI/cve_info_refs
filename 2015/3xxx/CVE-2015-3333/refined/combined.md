## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3334.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3336.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3335 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3335)

#### Description

The NaClSandbox::InitializeLayerTwoSandbox function in components/nacl/loader/sandbox\_linux/nacl\_sandbox\_linux.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not have RLIMIT\_AS and RLIMIT\_DATA limits for Native Client (aka NaCl) processes, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct row-hammer attacks or have unspecified other impact by leveraging the ability to run a crafted program in the NaCl sandbox.

The Chrome team is overjoyed to announce the promotion of Chrome 42 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 42.0.2311.90 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps, extension and Web Platform APIs (including the [Push API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/tip/index.html)!)
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance
* The answer to [life, the universe and everything](https://www.google.com/search?&q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything&gws_rd=ssl)

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/41.0.2272.0..42.0.2311.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [45 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M42&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[476786](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476786)] CVE-2015-1249: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.2 branch (currently 4.2.77.14).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

An issue was discovered in the HTML parser in Blink. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1235](/security/CVE-2015-1235))

An issue was discovered in the Web Audio API implementation in Blink. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2015-1236](/security/CVE-2015-1236))

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1237](/security/CVE-2015-1237))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2015-1238](/security/CVE-2015-1238))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the WebGL implementation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash. ([CVE-2015-1240](/security/CVE-2015-1240))

An issue was discovered with the interaction of page navigation and touch

event handling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

"tap jacking" attacks. ([CVE-2015-1241](/security/CVE-2015-1241))

A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1242](/security/CVE-2015-1242))

It was discovered that websocket connections were not upgraded whenever a

HSTS policy is active. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. ([CVE-2015-1244](/security/CVE-2015-1244))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.

([CVE-2015-1246](/security/CVE-2015-1246))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1249](/security/CVE-2015-1249))

A use-after-free was discovered in the file picker implementation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1321](/security/CVE-2015-1321))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-3333](/security/CVE-2015-3333))

# CVE-2015-3334

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3333.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3335.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3334 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3334)

#### Description

browser/ui/website\_settings/website\_settings.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always display "Media: Allowed by you" in a Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission to a web site, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that turns on the camera at a time when the user believes that camera access is prohibited.
