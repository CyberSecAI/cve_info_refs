Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache` helper program not properly sanitizing the process environment before invoking `abrt-action-install-debuginfo`. Specifically, it was found to be vulnerable to:
    - Unsanitized umask settings.
    - Untrusted command line options passed to the executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing process environment sanitization:** The helper program failed to clear or restrict the environment variables inherited when it executed `abrt-action-install-debuginfo`. This includes `umask` which can be modified by a user to create files with relaxed permissions.
*   **Unsanitized command line arguments:** The helper program was not properly filtering command line arguments passed to it. This allowed an attacker to pass in options like `cache`, `tmpdir`, or `size_mb` that could lead to issues like creating user-writable dump directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system by manipulating the environment or command line arguments to `abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache` to perform actions with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Manipulating Environment Variables:** The attacker could manipulate environment variables, specifically the umask, before running the vulnerable program.
*   **Crafting Malicious Command Line Options:** The attacker could craft specific command line options to influence the behavior of the program and potentially execute actions with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable `abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache` program.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable program's behavior and the exploitable command-line arguments and environment variables.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves setting a safe `umask` value (0022) and implementing a whitelist for allowed command-line options.
*   The fix also addresses the potential for information disclosure by opening the `build_ids` file using the caller's UID/GID and passing the file descriptor to the wrapped executable.
*   The issue is mitigated in later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 due to a regression, but this mitigation does not address the root cause of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
