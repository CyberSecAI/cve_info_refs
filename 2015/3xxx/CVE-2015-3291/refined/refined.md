Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3291:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from `ubuntu.com`, `kernel.org` and `bugzilla.redhat.com` clearly indicates that the identified vulnerability relates to CVE-2015-3291. Specifically:
*   `ubuntu.com` explicitly mentions "Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw that allows user to cause the Linux kernel to ignore some NMIs (non-maskable interrupts)." and links it to CVE-2015-3291.
*   `kernel.org` contains the commit log that fixes the vulnerability.
*   `bugzilla.redhat.com` has a bug report with the CVE number.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the Linux kernel's handling of Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs) on x86-64 architectures, specifically when a malicious userspace program manipulates the stack pointer (RSP) before an NMI occurs.

The kernel attempts to detect nested NMIs by checking if the current RSP points within the NMI stack region. However, this check can be bypassed:
*   A malicious user-space program can set the RSP to point to the NMI stack.
*   When the user-space process executes a `syscall` or before `sysret`, if an NMI occurs the kernel's check would falsely identify this as a nested NMI leading to incorrect handling. This vulnerability exists because the kernel does not properly consider the possibility of a user-controlled RSP in these scenarios, causing NMIs to be ignored under specific conditions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect NMI Handling:** The kernel's logic for identifying and handling nested NMIs is flawed, allowing a malicious user to manipulate the stack in a way that causes the kernel to bypass the NMI handler
*   **Reliance on User-Controlled RSP:** The kernel relies on the value of RSP for nested NMI detection which a user can potentially manipulate.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By manipulating the RSP and triggering an NMI, a malicious user can force the kernel to ignore that NMI resulting in DoS. This could cause important system functions relying on NMIs to fail.
*   **Unspecified effects:** According to the ubuntu advisory, the flaw can cause the system to miss "important NMIs resulting in unspecified effects."

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the system to manipulate the RSP and trigger an NMI.
*   **Userspace Program:** The vulnerability is exploited by a specifically crafted user-space program.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary code within a user-space process.
*   **Privilege:**  The attacker does not need elevated privileges, as the vulnerability can be triggered by unprivileged local users.
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of how the kernel manages the NMI stack and the conditions needed to manipulate RSP.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   **Patch Implementation:** The fix involves using the Direction Flag (DF) in the x86 architecture. The kernel now sets the DF before clearing the "NMI executing" flag, allowing it to identify user-controlled RSP and properly process NMIs in those situations.
*   **Affected Systems:** The vulnerability affects systems running Linux kernels with the flawed nested NMI handling logic. Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.04 are specifically mentioned as vulnerable in some of the provided links.
*   **Mitigation:** On systems where patching is not immediately feasible, seccomp can be used to disable perf_event_open or modify_ldt which may help in mitigating the risk.
*   **Low Severity:** While the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, it is rated as "low" severity by RedHat and ubuntu.
