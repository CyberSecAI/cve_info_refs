{
  "CVE-2015-3451": {
    "description": "The `_clone` function in XML::LibXML before 2.0119 does not properly set the `expand_entities` option, which allows remote attackers to conduct XML external entity (XXE) attacks via crafted XML data to the (1) `new` or (2) `load_xml` function.",
    "affected_component": "XML::LibXML",
    "root_cause": "The `_clone` function in XML::LibXML was not preserving the `expand_entities` option when cloning parser objects, which led to external entities not being disabled as intended.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this to potentially read local files or access other sensitive data on the server processing XML.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "crafted XML data"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can send crafted XML data to a server using the vulnerable XML::LibXML library.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the `_clone` function didn't properly copy all the parser options including `expand_entities`. This issue is triggered when creating a new XML::LibXML parser object using `XML::LibXML->new` and then using `$parser->load_xml` rather than directly calling `XML::LibXML->load_xml`. The fix involves ensuring the `expand_entities` option is correctly preserved after cloning the parser object."
