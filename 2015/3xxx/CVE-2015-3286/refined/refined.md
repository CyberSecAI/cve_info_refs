Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A fixed-size buffer was used in the Solaris kernel extension of OpenAFS to store the group list associated with a Process Authentication Group (PAG).
- Starting with Solaris 10, the kernel allowed more groups than could fit in this fixed-size buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. When a user joins a PAG with a group list larger than the allocated buffer, the excess data overwrites adjacent kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Overwrite:**  Since group IDs are encoded as 32-bit integers, pushing the group list beyond the buffer could overwrite arbitrary kernel memory with group IDs.
- **Kernel Panic/Deadlock:** Attempts to return an error due to the buffer overflow could lead to a kernel deadlock.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to join a PAG.
- They need to be able to manipulate their group list to be larger than the allocated buffer to trigger the overflow.

**Summary of the Security Advisory:**
- OpenAFS versions up to and including 1.6.12 are vulnerable.
- The fix is available in OpenAFS version 1.6.13 and newer.
- A patch for older versions is available on the OpenAFS security advisory page.
