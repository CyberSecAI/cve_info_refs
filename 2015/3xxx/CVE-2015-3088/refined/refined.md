  "CVE-2015-3088": {
    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to a heap-based buffer overflow in the `AVSS.setSubscribedTags` function within Adobe Flash Player. The issue arises when a custom `toString()` method in an object within an array is called during the processing of `setSubscribedTags`. This method can trigger another call to `setSubscribedTags` with a smaller array, leading to freeing the initial buffer. When the execution returns to the initial `setSubscribedTags` call, the freed buffer is reallocated with a smaller size while the code continues to write data into the original buffer using the initial size, resulting in a heap overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By registering an object with a custom toString method in an array and calling `AVSS.setSubscribedTags(array)`. When object.toString() is called, it calls again `AVSS.setSubscribedTags` with a smaller array. This results in freeing the first buffer. When the execution flow returns to `AVSS.setSubscribedTags` a heap overflow occurs allowing an attacker to write data outside allocated memory bounds.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to trigger execution of a crafted SWF file to exploit this vulnerability."
