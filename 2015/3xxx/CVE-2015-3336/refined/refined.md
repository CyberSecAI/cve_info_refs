Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Google Chrome not consistently prompting the user for permission before executing fullscreen and mouse pointer lock requests initiated by a website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate user permission enforcement for CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_FULLSCREEN and CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_MOUSELOCK.
- The browser fails to always request user confirmation before entering fullscreen mode or locking the mouse pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **UI Disruption (Denial of Service):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by disrupting the user interface. This is done by forcing the browser to enter fullscreen mode or locking the mouse pointer without the user's explicit consent, causing confusion or potentially preventing the user from interacting with the browser or operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTML Document:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML document containing JavaScript code.
- **JavaScript Code:** The JavaScript code uses `requestFullScreen` and `requestPointerLock` calls to trigger the fullscreen and mouse lock features.
- **File: URL:** The user is tricked into accessing the malicious HTML document through a "file:" URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be local to the user's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user to open the crafted HTML file, likely through social engineering or other means.
- **Basic Web Development Skills:** The attacker needs to create HTML and JavaScript with specific API calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome versions prior to 42.0.2311.90.
- The SUSE bugzilla entry 927302 confirms this CVE, and references the chromium issue detail [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455953](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455953) for this vulnerability.
- The issue is described as a "user-assisted" attack, meaning the attacker needs the user to take action.

In summary, CVE-2015-3336 allows a remote attacker to cause UI disruptions by exploiting the lack of consistent permission requests for fullscreen and mouse pointer lock features within Google Chrome, requiring a user to open a crafted html document from a file: url.
