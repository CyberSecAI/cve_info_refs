Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the handling of "IPsec compression" during VPN connections on Innominate mGuard devices. Specifically, when the VPN initiating peer has the "IPsec compression" option enabled, it can cause a denial of service (DoS) on the VPN daemon on the receiving side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-272: Least Privilege Violation**: The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-272, indicating a violation of the principle of least privilege. This means the VPN daemon is not properly handling the compressed packets which allows a malicious actor to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a temporary denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the VPN daemon of the receiving mGuard device. This makes the VPN service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely. The attacker needs to initiate a VPN connection to the target device with the "IPsec compression" option enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a VPN connection to a vulnerable mGuard device.
- Low skill is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected mGuard firmware versions are 8.0.0 to 8.1.6.
- Innominate has released patches for the affected versions. They also recommend that customers on older, unsupported versions should upgrade to version 8.1.7.
- The advisory recommends limiting administrative interface access using firewall rules.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8
- CVSS Vector String: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
  -   AV:N (Network): The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
  -   AC:L (Low): The attack complexity is low.
  -   Au:N (None): No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
  -   C:N (None): There is no impact on confidentiality.
  -   I:N (None): There is no impact on integrity.
  -   A:C (Complete): There is a complete impact on availability (DoS).
