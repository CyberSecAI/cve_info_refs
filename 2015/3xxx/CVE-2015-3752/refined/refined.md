  "CVE-2015-3752": {
    "description": "The Content Security Policy implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before 8.0.8, as used in iOS before 8.4.1 and other products, does not properly restrict cookie transmission for report requests, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via vectors involving (1) a cross-origin request or (2) a private-browsing request.",
    "root_cause": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in WebKit did not properly restrict cookie transmission for report requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of cookie transmission in CSP report requests",
      "Cookies sent in cross-origin report requests",
        "Cookies set during regular browsing sent in private browsing."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can obtain sensitive information by intercepting cookies sent in report requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cross-origin request",
      "Private-browsing request"
