It reaffirms the description of the vulnerability which is that backslashes are replaced with slashes in the path parameter of HTTP API calls after path normalization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files. The fix is in commit `9d4e5f6`, which is included in the 1.5.3 release. This correction means the vulnerability affects Etherpad versions 1.1.1 through 1.5.2."
