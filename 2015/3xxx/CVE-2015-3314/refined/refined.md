Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-3314

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress Tune Library Plugin version 1.5.4 and likely below

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Insufficient input validation when sorting artists by letter in the WordPress Tune Library plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, modifications, or deletion.
* The provided proof of concept demonstrates that an attacker could retrieve the database version, current user, and database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the Tune Library page, specifically using the `artistletter` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
* Specific conditions must be met:
    1.  The WordPress security feature `wp_magic_quotes()`, which is enabled by default, has to be disabled.
    2. The plugin-specific option "Filter artists by letter and show alphabetical navigation" has to be enabled.

**Technical Details:**
* The exploit uses a crafted SQL injection payload in the `artistletter` parameter within a URL.
* Example payload: `http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&artistletter=G' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT_WS(CHAR(59),version(),current_user(),database()),2--%20`
   * This payload injects SQL code that will retrieve the database version, current user, and database name.

**Mitigation:**
* Update to the most recent version of the plugin (1.5.5).
* As a workaround, ensure `wp_magic_quotes()` is enabled and/or disable the "Filter artists by letter..." option in the plugin settings.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Hannes Trunde.
* The plugin's changelog on the WordPress plugin repository confirms that version 1.5.5 fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* The exploit has been assigned a CVSS Base Score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
