Is this different from

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8810>

? We feel that we may not have definitive information about whether
that SQL injection was ever fixed. The
<http://www.wpsymposium.com/2014/11/release-information-for-v14-11/>
page no longer exists with its 2014 content, but had previously only
mentioned fixing XSS, not fixing SQL injection.

=======================================================================
              title: SQL Injection
            product: WordPress Tune Library Plugin
 vulnerable version: 1.5.4 (and probably below)
      fixed version: 1.5.5
         CVE number: CVE-2015-3314
             impact: CVSS Base Score 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
           homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tune-library/

=======================================================================

Plugin description:
-------------------
"This plugin is used to import an XML iTunes Music Library file into your
WordPress database. Once imported, you can display a complete listing of your
music collection on a page of your WordPress site."

Source: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tune-library/

Recommendation:
---------------
The author has provided a fixed plugin version which should be installed
immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Because of insufficient input validation, a sql injection attack can be
performed when sorting artists by letter.

However, special conditions must be met in order to exploit this vulnerability:
1) The wordpress security feature wp_magic_quotes(), which is enabled by
   default, has to be disabled.
2) The plugin specific option "Filter artists by letter and show alphabetical
   navigation" has to be enabled.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following HTTP request to the Tune Library page returns version, current
user and db name:
===============================================================================
http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&artistletter=G' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT_WS(CHAR(59),version(),current_user(),database()),2--%20
===============================================================================

Contact timeline:
------------------------
2015-04-08: Contacting author via mail.
2015-04-09: Author replies and announces a fix within a week.
2015-04-12: Mail from author, stating that plugin has been updated.
2015-04-14: Requesting CVE via post to the open source software security mailing
            list: http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/14/5
2015-04-20: Release of security advisory.

Solution:
---------
Update to the most recent plugin version.

Workaround:
-----------
Make sure that wp_magic_quotes() is enabled and/or disable "Filter artists by
letter..." option.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
