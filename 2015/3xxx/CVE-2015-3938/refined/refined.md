- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The built-in HTTP application within the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC FX-series controllers is unable to handle parameters that exceed the expected length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of parameters (CWE-233). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the HTTP application's inability to manage excessively long parameters, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, requiring a reboot of the affected machine for recovery.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the HTTP application of the controllers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with medium skill can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending an HTTP request with an overly long parameter.
