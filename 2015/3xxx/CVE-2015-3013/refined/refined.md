- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A blacklist bypass vulnerability in ownCloud's file upload mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly restrict certain file types, specifically allowing the upload of .htaccess files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload a malicious .htaccess file. If the /data/ directory is located inside the web root, and the web server interprets .htaccess files, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated remote attackers who can bypass the file blacklist during file upload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to upload files to the ownCloud server. They also need to target an ownCloud installation where the data directory is within the web root and the web server processes .htaccess files.
