Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how CCleaner overwrites filenames when tasked with secure deletion. Instead of truly randomizing or securely deleting filename entries in the Master File Table (MFT) on NTFS drives, CCleaner overwrites each character of the filename with the letter "Z".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The core weakness is that CCleaner doesn't securely delete filenames. It overwrites them in a predictable manner (with the letter "Z"), leaving a pattern that reveals the original filename length and, crucially, the original filename itself, prior to it being overwritten. This allows for the original filename recovery by analyzing the overwritten filename data within the unallocated space of the hard drive.
- **Predictable Overwriting:** The use of a single character ('Z') for overwriting makes recovery trivial.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:**  An attacker or forensic analyst can recover the original filenames of files that were supposedly securely deleted by CCleaner. This reveals the existence of those files and potentially provides context about the data that was intended to be deleted.
- **Compromised Data Removal Efforts**: The vulnerability defeats the purpose of secure deletion, as the information about the file (its name) is still recoverable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally, requiring an attacker to have access to the physical or virtual disk after CCleaner has run.
- **Forensic Analysis:** A forensic analyst, even with good intentions, could uncover the information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to the Disk:** The attacker needs to be able to analyze the disk where CCleaner was used, specifically unallocated space. This implies that the attacker may have:
    -  Physical access to the system.
    -  Access to a disk image or backup of the system.
    -  Access to a virtual disk.
-   **Basic Disk Analysis Knowledge:** Some knowledge of forensic analysis of file systems and how data remnants are left in unallocated space would be needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects CCleaner versions 3.26.0.1988 through 5.02.5101.
- The vulnerability is specific to how CCleaner handles file overwriting on NTFS formatted drives in Windows 7 x64 Service Pack 1.
- The advisory mentions that while CCleaner overwrites file content, it also overwrites the filenames in a predictable way within the Master File Table (MFT).
- The predictable pattern of overwritten filenames can be easily identified and reconstructed by a disk analysis.
- The advisory includes a timeline of disclosure, highlighting the response from Piriform.
