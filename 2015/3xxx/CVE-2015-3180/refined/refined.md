Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3180:

*   **Root Cause:** The issue stems from how Moodle's navigation block handles suspended enrollments. Even when a user's enrollment in a course is suspended, the system was still allowing the user to see the course's structure (sections) within the navigation block.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to information disclosure. Although a user with a suspended enrollment cannot access the course content, they can still view the structure of the course. This reveals information about the course's layout and organization to users who should not have access.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is considered minor. The vulnerability does not allow access to actual course materials or allow the suspended user to interact with the course, however it reveals the course structure.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the navigation block in Moodle's user interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an enrolled user in a course who has subsequently had their enrollment suspended. No other specific capabilities are mentioned.
