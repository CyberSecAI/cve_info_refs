Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-3038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory corruption issue within Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption**:  The primary vulnerability is memory corruption. The specific type of memory corruption (e.g., heap overflow, use-after-free) is not detailed in the provided content, but it is mentioned that it could lead to both arbitrary code execution and denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Successful exploitation of the memory corruption vulnerability can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exploitation can also cause a denial of service by crashing the Flash Player.
- **Bypass ASLR**: Additionally, memory leak vulnerabilities associated with this CVE family (specifically CVE-2015-3040) are mentioned as being used to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unspecified Vectors**: The content mentions "unspecified vectors" as the means to trigger the vulnerability. This typically means that the exploit can be triggered through various means, such as by loading a malicious SWF file or other attack vectors that use flash player.
- **Network**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated**: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing any authentication.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious SWF file or similar content that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by a vulnerable flash player.
