Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-3308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the GnuTLS library related to the parsing of Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution points within X.509 certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The core issue is a double-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory that has already been freed is attempted to be freed again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The double-free can cause the application to crash.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the most likely result is a DoS, the description mentions that "creating something more interesting using double-free exploitation techniques is not out of the question," suggesting that with more sophisticated exploitation, other impacts like arbitrary code execution could theoretically be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Certificate:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted X.509 certificate containing malicious CRL distribution points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Certificate Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft or manipulate X.509 certificates to include malicious CRL distribution points.
- **Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to target an application that uses the vulnerable versions of GnuTLS. Applications parsing CRL distribution points, or printing certificate information using GnuTLS functions, are vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in GnuTLS versions prior to 3.3.14.
- The fix involves clearing `san.data` and `san.size` in `lib/x509/x509_ext.c` and is addressed by commits d6972be3 and 053ae654.
- The issue affects applications parsing CRL distribution points, or printing contents of certificates using GnuTLS-provided functions (e.g., `gnutls_x509_crt_print()`).
