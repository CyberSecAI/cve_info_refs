Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2015-3001:

**CVE-2015-3001**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The SysAid installer, when used on Windows with the built-in SQL Server Express, sets the `sa` user password to a hard-coded value: "Password1".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Use of a hard-coded, default password for the SQL Server Express administrator account.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the SQL Server Express instance can gain full control over it by using this default password.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the Windows server hosting the SysAid application. No network access is explicitly required, but having network access could enable more sophisticated attacks against other parts of the system once database access is obtained.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have access to the server where the SysAid application is installed with the built-in SQL Server Express, since they would need to access the SQL Server to exploit this.
