[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2709)

## Topic

An update is now available for JBoss Core Services on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2 serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the httpd's mod\_auth\_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)
* It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)
* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

Red Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically. For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-39573: Apache HTTP Server: mod\_rewrite proxy
handler substitution (cve.mitre.org)
Potential SSRF in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
earlier allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to
unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by mod\_proxy.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38476: Apache HTTP Server may use
exploitable/malicious backend application output to run local
handlers via internal redirect (cve.mitre.org)
Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script
execution via backend applications whose response headers are
malicious or exploitable.
Note: Some legacy uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect a
request to a handler must be ported to 'AddHandler' after this fix.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38475: Apache HTTP Server weakness in
mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches
filesystem path. (cve.mitre.org)
Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem
locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are
not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in
code execution or source code disclosure.
Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or
variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.
Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the
rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once
ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38474: Apache HTTP Server weakness with
encoded question marks in backreferences (cve.mitre.org)
Substitution encoding issue in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in
directories permitted by the configuration but not directly
reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to
only to be executed as CGI.
Note: Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now
fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38473: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding
problem (cve.mitre.org)
Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent
to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via
crafted requests.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38472: Apache HTTP Server on Windows UNC SSRF
(cve.mitre.org)
SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak
NTML hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious
requests or content
Note: Existing configurations that access UNC paths
will have to configure new directive "UNCList" to allow access
during request processing.

Changes with Apache 2.4.58
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2023-45802: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream
memory not reclaimed right away on RST (cve.mitre.org)
When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there
was a time window were the request's memory resources were not
reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to
connection close. A client could send new requests and resets,
keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory
footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources
were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before
that.
This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487
(HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During
"normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very
low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the
connection closes or times out.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes
the issue.

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2023-43622: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with
initial windows size 0 (cve.mitre.org)
An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window
size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection
indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to
exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well
known "slow loris" attack pattern.
This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection
are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.
This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through
2.4.57.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes
the issue.

OpenSSL 3 by setting SSL\_OP\_IGNORE\_UNEXPECTED\_EOF if
available. [Rainer Jung]
\*) mod\_http2: improved early cleanup of streams.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_proxy\_http2: improved error handling on connection errors while
response is already underway.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_http2: fixed a bug that could lead to a crash in main connection
output handling. This occured only when the last request on a HTTP/2
connection had been processed and the session decided to shut down.
This could lead to an attempt to send a final GOAWAY while the previous
write was still in progress. See PR 66646.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_proxy\_http2: fix `X-Forward-Host` header to carry the correct value.
Fixes PR66752.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_http2: added support for bootstrapping WebSockets via HTTP/2, as
described in RFC 8441. A new directive 'H2WebSockets on|off' has been
added. The feature is by default not enabled.
As also discussed in the manual, this feature should work for setups
using "ProxyPass backend-url upgrade=websocket" without further changes.
Special server modules for WebSockets will have to be adapted,
most likely, as the handling if IO events is different with HTTP/2.
HTTP/2 WebSockets are supported on platforms with native pipes. This
excludes Windows.

\*) mod\_rewrite: Fix a regression with both a trailing ? and [QSA].
in OCSP stapling. PR 66672. [Frank Meier , covener]
\*) mod\_http2: fixed a bug in flushing pending data on an already closed
connection that could lead to a busy loop, preventing the HTTP/2 session
to close down successfully. Fixed PR 66624.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_http2: v2.0.15 with the following fixes and improvements
- New directive 'H2EarlyHint name value' to add headers to a response,
picked up already when a "103 Early Hints" response is sent. 'name' and
'value' must comply to the HTTP field restrictions.
This directive can be repeated several times and header fields of the
same names add. Sending a 'Link' header with 'preload' relation will
also cause a HTTP/2 PUSH if enabled and supported by the client.
- Fixed an issue where requests were not logged and accounted in a timely
fashion when the connection returns to "keepalive" handling, e.g. when
the request served was the last outstanding one.
This led to late appearance in access logs with wrong duration times
reported.
- Accurately report the bytes sent for a request in the '%O' Log format.
This addresses #203, a long outstanding issue where mod\_h2 has reported
numbers over-eagerly from internal buffering and not what has actually
been placed on the connection.
The numbers are now the same with and without H2CopyFiles enabled.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_proxy\_http2: fix retry handling to not leak temporary errors.
On detecting that that an existing connection was shutdown by the other
side, a 503 response leaked even though the request was retried on a
fresh connection.

\*) mod\_rewrite: Add server directory to include path as mod\_rewrite requires
test\_char.h. PR 66571 [Valeria Petrov ]
\*) mod\_http2: new directive `H2ProxyRequests on|off` to enable handling
of HTTP/2 requests in a forward proxy configuration.
General forward proxying is enabled via `ProxyRequests`. If the
HTTP/2 protocol is also enabled for such a server/host, this new
directive is needed in addition.

Setting this to 0 places no limit (but the max size allowed by the
protocol is observed).
The module, by default, tries to use the maximum size possible, which is
somewhat around 16KB. This sets the maximum. When less response data is
available, smaller frames will be sent.

mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy (cve.mitre.org)
Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions
2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.
Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with
some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific
pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL)
data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target
using variable substitution. For example, something like:
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/
Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access
controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to
existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

\*) mod\_proxy\_hcheck: Honor worker timeout settings. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_http2: version 2.0.11 of the module, synchronizing changes
with the gitgub version. This is a partial rewrite of how connections
and streams are handled.
- an APR pollset and pipes (where supported) are used to monitor
the main connection and react to IO for request/response handling.
This replaces the stuttered timed waits of earlier versions.
- H2SerializeHeaders directive still exists, but has no longer an effect.
- Clients that seemingly misbehave still get less resources allocated,
but ongoing requests are no longer disrupted.
- Fixed an issue since 1.15.24 that "Server" headers in proxied requests
were overwritten instead of preserved. [PR by @daum3ns]
- A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd child
processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or when reaching
MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2 requests were queued at
the time, these could stall. See #212.
- Improved information displayed in 'server-status' for H2 connections when
Extended Status is enabled. Now one can see the last request that IO
operations happened on and transferred IO stats are updated as well.
- When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the HTTP/2 connection
send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new connections, leading to invalid
protocol state and a client failing the request. See PR65731 at
.
The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and allows the
client to submit one request before the shutdown via a GOAWAY frame
is being announced.
- :scheme pseudo-header values, not matching the
connection scheme, are forwarded via absolute uris to the
http protocol processing to preserve semantics of the request.
Checks on combinations of pseudo-headers values/absence
have been added as described in RFC 7540. Fixes #230.
- A bug that prevented trailers (e.g. HEADER frame at the end) to be
generated in certain cases was fixed. See #233 where it prevented
gRPC responses to be properly generated.
- Request and response header values are automatically stripped of leading
and trialing space/tab characters. This is equivalent behaviour to what
Apache httpd's http/1.1 parser does.
The checks for this in nghttp2 v1.50.0+ are disabled.
- Extensive testing in production done by Alessandro Bianchi (@alexskynet)
on the v2.0.x versions for stability. Many thanks!

- Added support for ACME External Account Binding (EAB).
Use the new directive `MDExternalAccountBinding` to provide the

your CA.
While working on some servers, EAB handling is not uniform
across CAs. First tests with a Sectigo Certificate Manager in
demo mode are successful. But ZeroSSL, for example, seems to
regard EAB values as a one-time-use-only thing, which makes them
fail if you create a seconde account or retry the creation of the
first account with the same EAB.
- The directive 'MDCertificateAuthority' now checks if its parameter
is a http/https url or one of a set of known names. Those are
'LetsEncrypt', 'LetsEncrypt-Test', 'Buypass' and 'Buypass-Test'
for now and they are not case-sensitive.
The default of LetsEncrypt is unchanged.
- `MDContactEmail` can now be specified inside a ``
section.
- Treating 401 HTTP status codes for orders like 403, since some ACME
servers seem to prefer that for accessing oders from other accounts.
- When retrieving certificate chains, try to read the response even
if the HTTP Content-Type is unrecognized.
- Fixed a bug that reset the error counter of a certificate renewal
and prevented the increasing delays in further attempts.
- Fixed the renewal process giving up every time on an already existing
order with some invalid domains. Now, if such are seen in a previous
order, a new order is created for a clean start over again.
See
- Fixed a mixup in md-status handler when static certificate files
and renewal was configured at the same time.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP

traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories
configured by Alias-like directives.
If files outside of these directories are not protected by the

can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased
paths, this could allow for remote code execution.

mod\_http2: Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference [Ivan Zhakov]
\*) mod\_proxy\_wstunnel: Add ProxyWebsocketFallbackToProxyHttp to opt-out the
fallback to mod\_proxy\_http for WebSocket upgrade and tunneling.

\*) mod\_proxy: Fix flushing of THRESHOLD\_MIN\_WRITE data while tunneling.
PR 65294. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) core: Fix a regression that stripped the ETag header from 304 responses.
PR 61820 [Ruediger Pluem, Roy T. Fielding]
\*) core: Adding SSL related inquiry functions to the server API.
These function are always available, even when no module providing
SSL is loaded. They provide their own "shadowing" implementation for
the optional functions of similar name that mod\_ssl and impersonators
of mod\_ssl provide.
This enables loading of several SSL providing modules when all but
one of them registers itself into the new hooks. Two old-style SSL
modules will not work, as they replace the others optional functions
with their own.
Modules using the old-style optional functions will continue to work
as core supplies its own versions of those.
The following has been added so far:
- ap\_ssl\_conn\_is\_ssl() to query if a connection is using SSL.
- ap\_ssl\_var\_lookup() to query SSL related variables for a
server/connection/request.
- Hooks for 'ssl\_conn\_is\_ssl' and 'ssl\_var\_lookup' where modules
providing SSL can install their own value supplying functions.
- ap\_ssl\_add\_cert\_files() to enable other modules like mod\_md to provide
certificate and keys for an SSL module like mod\_ssl.
- ap\_ssl\_add\_fallback\_cert\_files() to enable other modules like mod\_md to
provide a fallback certificate in case no 'proper' certificate is
available for an SSL module like mod\_ssl.
- ap\_ssl\_answer\_challenge() to enable other modules like mod\_md to
provide a certificate as used in the RFC 8555 'tls-alpn-01' challenge
for the ACME protocol for an SSL module like mod\_ssl. The function
and its hook provide PEM encoded data instead of file names.
- Hooks for 'ssl\_add\_cert\_files', 'ssl\_add\_fallback\_cert\_files' and
'ssl\_answer\_challenge' where modules like mod\_md can provide providers
to the above mentioned functions.
- These functions reside in the new 'http\_ssl.h' header file.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) core/mod\_ssl/mod\_md: adding OCSP response provisioning as core feature. This
allows modules to access and provide OCSP response data without being tied
of each other. The data is exchanged in standard, portable formats (PEM encoded
certificates and DER encoded responses), so that the actual SSL/crypto
implementations used by the modules are independant of each other.
Registration and retrieval happen in the context of a server (server\_rec)
which modules may use to decide if they are configured for this or not.
The area of changes:
1. core: defines 2 functions in include/http\_ssl.h, so that modules may
register a certificate, together with its issuer certificate for OCSP
response provisioning and ask for current response data (DER bytes) later.
Also, 2 hooks are defined that allow modules to implement this OCSP
provisioning.
2. mod\_ssl uses the new functions, in addition to what it did already, to
register its certificates this way. If no one is interested in providing
OCSP, it falls back to its own (if configured) stapling implementation.
3. mod\_md registers itself at the core hooks for OCSP provisioning. Depending
on configuration, it will accept registrations of its own certificates only,
all certificates or none.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_md: v2.4.0 with improvements and bugfixes
- MDPrivateKeys allows the specification of several types. Beside "RSA" plus
optional key lengths elliptic curves can be configured. This means you can
have multiple certificates for a Managed Domain with different key types.
With ```MDPrivateKeys secp384r1 rsa2048``` you get one ECDSA and one RSA
certificate and all modern client will use the shorter ECDSA, while older
client will get the RSA certificate.
Many thanks to @tlhackque who pushed and helped on this.
- Support added for MDomains consisting of a wildcard. Configuring
```MDomain \*.host.net``` will match all virtual hosts matching that pattern
and obtain one certificate for it (assuming you have 'dns-01' challenge
support configured). Addresses #239.
- Removed support for ACMEv1 servers. The only known installation used to
be Let's Encrypt which has disabled that version more than a year ago for
new accounts.
- Andreas Ulm () implemented the
```renewing``` call to ```MDMessageCmd``` that can deny a certificate
renewal attempt. This is useful in clustered installations, as
discussed in #233).
- New event ```challenge-setup::```, triggered when the
challenge data for a domain has been created. This is invoked before the
ACME server is told to check for it. The type is one of the ACME challenge
types. This is invoked for every DNS name in a MDomain.
- The max delay for retries has been raised to daily (this is like all
retries jittered somewhat to avoid repeats at fixed time of day).
- Certain error codes reported by the ACME server that indicate a problem
with the configured data now immediately switch to daily retries. For
example: if the ACME server rejects a contact email or a domain name,
frequent retries will most likely not solve the problem. But daily retries
still make sense as there might be an error at the server and un-supervised
certificate renewal is the goal. Refs #222.
- Test case and work around for domain names > 64 octets. Fixes #227.
When the first DNS name of an MD is longer than 63 octets, the certificate
request will not contain a CN field, but leave it up to the CA to choose one.
Currently, Lets Encrypt looks for a shorter name in the SAN list given and
fails the request if none is found. But it is really up to the CA (and what
browsers/libs accept here) and may change over the years. That is why
the decision is best made at the CA.
- Retry delays now have a random +/-[0-50]% modification applied to let
retries from several servers spread out more, should they have been
restarted at the same time of day.
- Fixed several places where the 'badNonce' return code from an ACME server
was not handled correctly. The test server 'pebble' simulates this behaviour
by default and helps nicely in verifying this behaviour. Thanks, pebble!
- Set the default `MDActivationDelay` to 0. This was confusing to users that
new certificates were deemed not usably before a day of delay. When clocks are
correct, using a new certificate right away should not pose a problem.
- When handling ACME authorization resources, the module no longer requires
the server to return a "Location" header, as was necessary in ACMEv1.
Fixes #216.
- Fixed a theoretical uninitialized read when testing for JSON error responses
from the ACME CA. Reported at .
- ACME problem reports from CAs that include parameters in the Content-Type
header are handled correctly. (Previously, the problem text would not be
reported and retries could exceed CA limits.)
- Account Update transactions to V2 CAs now use the correct POST-AS-GET method.
Previously, an empty JSON object was sent - which apparently LE accepted,
but others reject.

certificate renewal, unless another "MDCertificateAuthority" is configured
- ACMEv2 endpoints use the GET via empty POST way of accessing resources, see
announcement by Let's Encrypt:
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-scheduled-deprecation-of-unauthenticated-resource-gets/74380
- challenges
- new challenge method 'tls-alpn-01' implemented
- challenge type 'tls-sni-01' has been removed as CAs do not offer this any longer
- supports command configuration to setup/teardown 'dns-01' challenges
- supports wildcard certificates when dns challenges are configured
- status information and monitoring
- a domain exposes its status at https:///.httpd/certificate-status
- Managed Domains are now in Apache's 'server-status' page
- A new handler 'md-status' exposes verbose status information in JSON format
- new directives
- "MDCertificateFile" and "MDCertificateKeyFile" to configure a
Managed Domain that uses static files. Auto-renewal is turned off for those.
- "MDMessageCmd" that is invoked on several events: 'renewed', 'expiring' and
'errored'.
- "MDWarnWindow" directive to configure when expiration warnings shall be issued.

of aborting. If a specific module is requested with --enable-XXX=yes,
missing dependencies will still cause configure to exit with an error.

[William Rowe]
\*) mod\_cache: Introduce CacheStoreExpired, to allow administrators to
capture a stale backend response, perform If-Modified-Since requests
against the backend, and serving from the cache all 304 responses.
This restores pre-2.2.4 cache behavior. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Introduce <=, >= string comparison operators, and integer
comparators -lt, -le, -eq, -ge, and -gt. To help bash users and drop
the ambiguity of the symlink test "-ltest", introduce -h or -L as

exposed within include\_ctx\_t. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_include: Reinstate support for UTF-8 character sets by allowing a
variable being echoed or set to be decoded and then encoded as separate
steps. PR47686 [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cache: Add a discrete commit\_entity() provider function within the
mod\_cache provider interface which is called to indicate to the
provider that caching is complete, giving the provider the opportunity
to commit temporary files permanently to the cache in an atomic
fashion. Replace the inconsistent use of error cleanups with a formal
set of pool cleanups attached to a subpool, which is destroyed on error.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cache: Change the signature of the store\_body() provider function
within the mod\_cache provider interface to support an "in" brigade
and an "out" brigade instead of just a single input brigade. This
gives a cache provider the option to consume only part of the brigade
passed to it, rather than the whole brigade as was required before.

\*) core, mod\_proxy: If a kept\_body is present, it becomes safe for
subrequests to support message bodies. Make sure that safety
checks within the core and within the proxy are not triggered
when kept\_body is present. This makes it possible to embed
proxied POST requests within mod\_include. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_auth\_form: Make sure the input filter stack is properly set
up before reading the login form. Make sure the kept body filter
is correctly inserted to ensure the body can be read a second
time safely should the authn be successful. [Graham Leggett,
Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_request: Insert the KEPT\_BODY filter via the insert\_filter
hook instead of during fixups. Add a safety check to ensure the
filters cannot be inserted more than once. [Graham Leggett,

\*) ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers\_out() will (now) always
merge an error headers \_before\_ clearing them and \_before\_
merging in the actual entity headers and doing normal
hop-by-hop cleansing. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) cache: retire ap\_cache\_cacheable\_hdrs\_out() which was used
for both in- and out-put headers; and replace it by a single
ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers() wrapped in a in- and out-put
specific ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers\_in()/out(). The latter
which will also merge error and ensure content-type. To keep
cache modules consistent with ease. This API change bumps
up the minor MM by one [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) Move the KeptBodySize directive, kept\_body filters and the
ap\_parse\_request\_body function out of the http module and into a
new module called mod\_request, reducing the size of the core.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_dbd: Handle integer configuration directive parameters with a
dedicated function.
\*) Change the directives within the mod\_session\* modules to be valid
both inside and outside the location/directory sections, as
suggested by wrowe. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_auth\_form: Add a module capable of allowing end users to log
in using an HTML form, storing the credentials within mod\_session.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) Add a function to the http filters that is able to parse an HTML
form request with the type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

\*) mod\_session\_crypto: Initialise SSL in the post config hook.
[Ruediger Pluem, Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_dbd: Add a session implementation capable of storing
session information in a SQL database via the dbd interface. Useful
for sites where session privacy is important. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_crypto: Add a session encoding implementation capable
of encrypting and decrypting sessions wherever they may be stored.
Introduces a level of privacy when sessions are stored on the
browser. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_cookie: Add a session implementation capable of storing
session information within cookies on the browser. Useful for high
volume sites where server bound sessions are too resource intensive.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session: Add a generic session interface to unify the different
attempts at saving persistent sessions across requests.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
with configurations which match those of initial request. Revert to
original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
which can accept additional mode and flag data. [Chris Darroch]
\*) Introduced ap\_expr API for expression evaluation.
This is adapted from mod\_include, which is the first module
to use the new API.
[Nick Kew]
\*) mod\_authz\_dbd: When redirecting after successful login/logout per
AuthzDBDRedirectQuery, do not report authorization failure, and use
first row returned by database query instead of last row.

\*) Activate mod\_cache, mod\_file\_cache and mod\_disk\_cache as part of the
'most' set for '--enable-modules' and '--enable-shared-mods'. Include
mod\_mem\_cache in 'all' as well. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]
\*) Also install mod\_so.h, mod\_rewrite.h and mod\_cache.h; as these
contain public function declarations which are useful for
third party module authors. PR 42431 [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) mod\_dir, mod\_negotiation: pass the output filter information
to newly created sub requests; as these are later on used
as true requests with an internal redirect. This allows for
mod\_cache et.al. to trap the results of the redirect.
[Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_ldap: Add support (taking advantage of the new APR capability)
for ldap rebind callback while chasing referrals. This allows direct
searches on LDAP servers (in particular MS Active Directory 2003+)
using referrals without the use of the global catalog.
PRs 26538, 40268, and 42557 [Paul J. Reder]
\*) ApacheMonitor.exe: Introduce --kill argument for use by the

\*) mod\_serf: New module for Reverse Proxying. [Paul Querna]
\*) core: Add the option to keep aside a request body up to a certain
size that would otherwise be discarded, to be consumed by filters
such as mod\_include. When enabled for a directory, POST requests
to shtml files can be passed through to embedded scripts as POST
requests, rather being downgraded to GET requests. [Graham Leggett]

cleanups registered in modules' child\_init hooks are performed.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
on Win32. PR 40476. [Tom Donovan ]
\*) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]
\*) mod\_authn\_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE\_. This brings
mod\_authn\_dbd behaviour in line with mod\_authnz\_ldap. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
value of server\_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod\_dbd. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_proxy\_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]
\*) sendfile\_nonblocking() takes the \_brigade\_ as an argument, gets
the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
[Niklas Edmundsson ]
\*) mod\_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]
\*) ap\_get\_server\_version() has been removed. Third-party modules must
now use ap\_get\_server\_banner() or ap\_get\_server\_description().
[Jeff Trawick]
\*) All MPMs: Introduce a check\_config phase between pre\_config and
open\_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
to the console. Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
appropriate. [Chris Darroch]
\*) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod\_dir
to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]
\*) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than
the typical administrator is prepared to untangle. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_disk\_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
[Niklas Edmundsson ]
\*) Worker and event MPMs: Remove improper scoreboard updates which were
performed in the event of a fork() failure. [Chris Darroch]
\*) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod\_rewrite.
[Markus Schiegl ]
\*) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
loading of worker\_score structure with mod\_status, and remove unused
definitions relating to old life\_status field.
[Chris Darroch ]
\*) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb\_score pointers
in ap\_init\_scoreboard(). [Chris Darroch ]
\*) Add mod\_proxy\_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod\_proxy.

\*) Event MPM: Fill in the scoreboard's tid field. PR 38736.
[Chris Darroch ]
\*) mod\_charset\_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can
invalidate it. Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
[Jeff Trawick]
\*) Authz: Add the new module mod\_authn\_core that will provide common
authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'. Move the directives
'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod\_authz\_alias
into mod\_authn\_core. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy'
into the new module mod\_access\_compat which can be loaded to provide
support for these directives.
[Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as
add the directives '', '', ''
and 'Reject' to mod\_authz\_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR'
logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Add the new module mod\_authz\_core which acts as the
authorization provider vector and contains common authz
directives. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Renamed mod\_authz\_dbm authz providers from 'group' and
'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
host-based access control provided by mod\_authz\_host and invoked
through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to
provider based. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) mod\_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
seconds to cache a document.
[Brian Akins , Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_authz\_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]
\*) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
[Christophe Jaillet ]
\*) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM. [Brian Pane]
\*) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type. The logging of a request and
the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
of the response is sent; ap\_core\_output\_filter() calls the access logger
indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket. [Brian Pane]
\*) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]
\*) Rewrite of ap\_coreoutput\_filter to do nonblocking writes [Brian Pane]
\*) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
[Brian Pane]
\*) mod\_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs. PR 34264.
[Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Teach mod\_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### low: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with initial windows size 0 ([CVE-2023-43622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43622))

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

### low: core: Possible buffer overflow with very large or unlimited LimitXMLRequestBody ([CVE-2022-22721](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22721))

If LimitXMLRequestBody is set to allow request bodies larger than 350MB (defaults to 1M) on 32 bit systems an integer overflow happens which later causes out of bounds writes.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.

### critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773) ([CVE-2021-42013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42013))

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: mod\_http2, possible crash on late upgrade ([CVE-2019-0197](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0197))

When HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a https: host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. A server that never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did not configure the "H2Upgrade on" is unaffected by this.

A bug exists in the way mod\_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod\_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: HTTP request smuggling attack against chunked request parser ([CVE-2015-3183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3183))

An HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1288320#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-12-04 03:55:36 UTC  ``` The following was reported by OpenSSL upstream:  The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent mask generation function parameter. Since these routines are used to verifycertificate signature algorithms this can be used to crash any certificate verification operation and exploited in a DoS attack. Any application which performs certificate verification is vulnerable including OpenSSL clients and servers which enable client authentication.  This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1q  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 27 2015 by Loïc Jonas Etienne (Qnective AG). The fix was developed by Dr. Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1288320#c1)  Huzaifa S.

# CVE-2015-3185

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3184.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3187.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3185 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3185)

#### Description

The ap\_some\_auth\_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated with an authorization setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-05-20 18:18:35 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #931600](show_bug.cgi?id=931600 "NEW - VUL-0: CVE-2015-4000: The Logjam Attack / weakdh.org") +++  The apache 2.2.12 version in SLE11 has:  selection of either dh512 or dh1024 parameter, depending on server key size.  So it usually will select 1024 bit keys.  A dhparam override option does not exist currently (there is one, but it is not hooked up in the config framework at this time).   apache 2.4 in SLE12  A SSLCertificateFile statement can be used for specifying DH Params. (untested, just source code checking) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2015-05-21 13:49:41 UTC  ``` actually for SLE12:  create the dhparams with e.g.:  openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048  then _append_ this to the server certicate file.  cat dhparams.pem >> /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2015-05-22 11:44:02 UTC  ``` Note that if apache2 on SLE11 already has the export ciphers disabled, it is not be affected by the DHE_EXPORT downgrade attack either.  It will just use the not-so-unique 1024bit group. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c6)  Branislav Havel   2015-05-27 08:15:14 UTC  ``` Just a question on behalf of the customer whether we have any ETA when the patch is supposed to be released? Thank you ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c7)  Branislav Havel   2015-06-08 08:33:36 UTC  ``` I am sorry to ask you again, anyway, do we have any dates when the patch is supposed to be released?   Thank you ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c8)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2015-06-17 09:06:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c3)) > actually for SLE12: >  > create the dhparams with e.g.: >  > openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048 >  > then _append_ this to the server certicate file. >  > cat dhparams.pem >> /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt  This works also on RHEL and CentOS 6 with Apache 2.2.15. Seems it can be patched for Apache 2.2 for older releases than SLE12? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c9)  Klaus Vink Slott   2015-06-23 10:54:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Rosenauer from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c8)) > (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c3)) .. > > then _append_ this to the server certicate file. ...  > This works also on RHEL and CentOS 6 with Apache 2.2.15. > Seems it can be patched for Apache 2.2 for older releases than SLE12?  At the moment it does not seem possible to get a A rating on www.ssllabs.com/ssltest using Apache on OpenSUSE 13.1 based server  Although B is not bad*, we would really appreciate a fix for apache2-2.4 as included in OS13.1. Especially as it seems that 13.1 will be the next Evergreen   *).. but all my friends runs Ubuntu's with an A rating :-/ ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c10)  James Carter   2015-07-16 22:31:41 UTC  ``` I have OpenSuSE-13.1 with the stock apache2-2.4.6-6.47.1 and openssl-1.0.1k-11.72.1 . In responding to Logjam (CVE-2015-4000), I'm very tempted to upgrade to apache2-2.4.12 from the OpenSuSE-13.1 Apache sub-repo, and to install openssl-1.0.2 from Tumbleweed (if no dependency problems) or one of the community developers with 13.1 packages.  What holds me back is, future security patches will use the stock versions as a base, and if I make these upgrades I will miss future patches for other issues until probably the OpenSuSE version after 13.2, which is a very big negative factor.  So I'd like to request that the stock apache2 for OpenSuSE-13.1 should gain the ability to use locally generated Diffie-Hellman parameters, either by backporting or by upgrading the version.  As for which patch to backport, the one from apache-2.4.7 appears to make the smallest code changes, and will work with openssl-0.9.8.  But the sysadmin needs to append the DH parameters to his host certificate, which is a problem if he's ultra-paranoid and changes them on a schedule, or if the host cert is replaced the DH parameters may be forgotten.  Also I'm using a concatenated file with the key, cert, and (intermediate) CAs in that order.  Some guidance would be appreciated: should the DH params come after the host cert, or at the end of the file?  The patch from apache-2.4.8 that introduces the SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters directive is going to be a whole lot easier for the sysadmin, but more disruptive for the distro, since it requires advancing to openssl-1.0.2.  But perhaps the security team thinks an eventual transition to 1.0.2 is inevitable.  As the sysadmin, I would prefer this backport or version upgrade. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c11)  Marcus Meissner   2015-07-17 13:44:36 UTC  ``` the transition to 1.0.2 is done in factory and there all should be fine.  also 13.2 is good.  I am currently trying out to just diff modules/ssl/ between 13.1 and 13.2, apply that on top of 13.2 and submit it. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c12)  Marcus Meissner   2015-07-17 13:56:51 UTC  ``` home:msmeissn:branches:openSUSE:13.1:Update/apache2.openSUSE_13.1_Update   if you are curious ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2015-07-17 14:20:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 641266](attachment.cgi?id=641266&action=diff "apache2-2.4.10-ssl.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=641266&action=edit "apache2-2.4.10-ssl.patch") apache2-2.4.10-ssl.patch  patch for opensuse 13.1. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=931723#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-07-24 12:08:25 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3183 CVE-2015-3185

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2015-3183

    An HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in
    parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the
    server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning
    or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.

CVE-2015-3185

    A design error in the "ap_some_auth_required" function renders the
    API unusuable in apache2 2.4.x. This could lead to modules using
    this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so.
    The fix backports the new "ap_some_authn_required" API from 2.4.16.
    This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution (wheezy).

In addition, the updated package for the oldstable distribution (wheezy)
removes a limitation of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters to 1024 bits.
This limitation may potentially allow an attacker with very large
computing resources, like a nation-state, to break DH key exchange by
precomputation. The updated apache2 package also allows to configure
custom DH parameters. More information is contained in the
changelog.Debian.gz file.
These improvements were already present in the stable, testing, and
unstable distributions.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.22-13+deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 14:00:55 UTC  ``` Apache HTTP Server 2.4.16 release fixes the following issue:    *) SECURITY: [CVE-2015-3185](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3185) (cve.mitre.org)      Replacement of ap_some_auth_required (unusable in Apache httpd 2.4)      with new ap_some_authn_required and ap_force_authn hook.  [Ben Reser]  External References:  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.16>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 14:09:31 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1243894](show_bug.cgi?id=1243894 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3185 CVE-2015-3183 CVE-2015-0253 httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c2)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-21 08:12:18 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-29 13:39:08 UTC  ``` This issue was actually fixed in version 2.4.14.  However, as versions 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 were not released, 2.4.16 is the first released upstream version that includes the fix.  Upstream commit:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1684525>  Upstream also notes that this issue is only relevant for httpd 2.4, which made it possible to define authorization requirements and not only authentication requirements using Require configuration directive.  Therefore, httpd modules that use ap_some_auth_required() may incorrectly assume some request required authentication while only some authorization rule was applied.  As httpd versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier are based on older upstream httpd version (2.2 or 2.0), the are not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c4)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-30 00:51:45 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-24 15:57:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 EUS  Via RHSA-2015:1666 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1666.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-24 18:26:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:1667 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1667.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:14:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:38:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2017:2708 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2708](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2708)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:49:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:2709 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2709](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2709)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:50:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:2710 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2710](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2710)   ``` |  |

Sidhpurwala    2016-10-25 06:55:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  OpenSSL security update RHSA-2016:1940 mitigates this issue by lowering priority of DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by default and included in the set of cipher suites identified by the HIGH cipher string. Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default.  NSS addressed this issue by implementing limits on the amount of plain text which can be encrypted by using the same key. Once the limit is reached, the keys will need to be re-negotiated manually. This change will be available in nss-3.27.  GnuTLS is not affected by this issue, since it prioritizes AES before 3DES in the cipher list.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1369383#c23)  Huzaifa S.

For IBM JDK 7 and 8, it now includes "DESede" keyword to disable 3DES.  For IBM JDK 6, it now includes "3DES_EDE_CBC" keyword to disable 3DES.  Note that IBM originally claimed to have a fix for this issue included in versions 8 SR4, 7R1 SR4, and 7 SR10.  Those versions added "3DES_EDE_CBC" to jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms.  However, such change did not work as expected in IBM JDK 7 and 8, and still allowed the use of 3DES cipher suites.  The same change applied to IBM JDK 6 worked correctly.  This fix was improved in -FP1 versions by adding "DESede".  "3DES_EDE_CBC" was also preserved in the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms.  "DESede" also disables 3DES in IBM JDK6.  If applications need to continue using 3DES cipher suites, their support can be re-enabled by removing "DESede" and/or "3DES_EDE_CBC" keywords form the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property.  The value of the properly can be changed using the following ways:  * The default value can be set via the system java.security file, located in the jre/lib/security JDK directory.  * The system property java.security.properties can be used to make JDK override setting form the global java.security file with values from a user-specified one.  More details on using this system property can be found in [bug 1152789 comment 82](show_bug.cgi?id=1152789#c82 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3566 SSL/TLS: Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption attack").  * Value read from global or user/application specific java.security configuration file can be overridden by application at runtime using a call to Security.setProperty().   ```  [Comment

Mitigation:  1.SSL/TLS configurations should prefer AES over DES. Versions of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 already do so. In the version of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 3DES is listed below the AES-256 cipher and above the AES-128 cipher, therefore AES-256 based ciphersuite should not be disabled on the server. 2. Servers using OpenSSL, should not disable AES-128 and AES-256 ciphersuites. Versions of Apache shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux use the default cipher string, in which AES is preferred over DES/3DES based ciphersuites.  For JBoss Middleware, and Java mitigations, please review this knowledge base article:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/2598471>  This can be mitigated on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) by disabling the vulnerable TLS cipher suite in the applicable component. TLS configuration options for OCP are described here:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/5348961>   ```  [Comment 71](show_bug.cgi?id=1369383#c71)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-08 13:50:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6  Via RHSA-2021:0308 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0308](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0308)   ```  [Comment 72](show_bug.cgi?id=1369383#c72)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-07-27 22:31:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8  Via RHSA-2021:2438 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2438](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2438)   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2710)

## Topic

An update is now available for JBoss Core Services on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2 serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the httpd's mod\_auth\_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)
* It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)
* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

Red Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically. For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-13 14:45:44 UTC  ``` The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.  Affected are all versions through 2.2.33 and 2.4.26.  External References:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html#2.2.34> <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.27>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-13 15:02:49 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1470756](show_bug.cgi?id=1470756 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-9788 CVE-2017-9789 httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c2)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-07-19 08:57:09 UTC  ``` Patch:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1800919>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c11)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-07-26 13:16:39 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  If you do not use digest authentication, do not load the "auth_digest_module".  For example, on RHEL 7, this can be done by commenting out or removing the "LoadModule auth_digest_module modules/mod_auth_digest.so" line within the /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-base.conf configuration file and restarting the service.  You can then use the "httpd -t -D DUMP_MODULES" command to verify that the module is no longer loaded.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-15 18:14:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:2478 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2478](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2478)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-15 18:27:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:2479 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2479](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2479)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-16 23:07:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS  Via RHSA-2017:2483 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2483](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2483)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:38:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2017:2708 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2708](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2708)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:50:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:2709 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2709](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2709)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-13 16:51:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:2710 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2710](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2710)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-02 19:07:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Server  Via RHSA-2017:3114 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3114](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3114)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-02 19:17:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 6   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:3113 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3113](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3113)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-13 17:37:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:3193 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3193](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3193)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-13 17:39:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:3195 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3195](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3195)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-13 17:41:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:3194 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3194](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3194)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-16 19:10:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2017:3239 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3239](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3239)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1470748#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-16 19:28:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 6   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:3240 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3240](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3240)   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2017:2708 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 2 serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the httpd's mod\_auth\_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)
* It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using this API function could consequently allow access that should have been denied. (CVE-2015-3185)
* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

Red Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1666)

## Topic

Updated httpd24-httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
and extensible web server.

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function
ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was
authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using
this API function could consequently allow access that should have been
denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

Note: This update introduces new a new API function,
ap\_some\_authn\_required(), which correctly indicates if a request is
authenticated. External httpd modules using the old API function should be
modified to use the new one to completely resolve this issue.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the mod\_lua httpd module
processed certain WebSocket Ping requests. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted WebSocket Ping packet that would cause the httpd child
process to crash. (CVE-2015-0228)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way httpd generated
certain error responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
crash the httpd child process using a request that triggers a certain HTTP
error. (CVE-2015-0253)

All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
the updated packages, the httpd24-httpd service will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

## Description

The ap\_some\_auth\_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated with an authorization setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 14:00:55 UTC  ``` Apache HTTP Server 2.4.16 release fixes the following issue:    *) SECURITY: [CVE-2015-3185](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3185) (cve.mitre.org)      Replacement of ap_some_auth_required (unusable in Apache httpd 2.4)      with new ap_some_authn_required and ap_force_authn hook.  [Ben Reser]  External References:  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.16>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 14:09:31 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1243894](show_bug.cgi?id=1243894 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3185 CVE-2015-3183 CVE-2015-0253 httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c2)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-21 08:12:18 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-29 13:39:08 UTC  ``` This issue was actually fixed in version 2.4.14.  However, as versions 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 were not released, 2.4.16 is the first released upstream version that includes the fix.  Upstream commit:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1684525>  Upstream also notes that this issue is only relevant for httpd 2.4, which made it possible to define authorization requirements and not only authentication requirements using Require configuration directive.  Therefore, httpd modules that use ap_some_auth_required() may incorrectly assume some request required authentication while only some authorization rule was applied.  As httpd versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier are based on older upstream httpd version (2.2 or 2.0), the are not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1243888#c4)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-30 00:51:45 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

# CVE-2015-4000

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3991.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-4001.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-4000 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000)

#### Description

The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE\_EXPORT ciphersuite is enabled on a server but not on a client, does not properly convey a DHE\_EXPORT choice, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with DHE replaced by DHE\_EXPORT and then rewriting a ServerHello with DHE\_EXPORT replaced by DHE, aka the "Logjam" issue.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for apache2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:1684-1
Rating: moderate
References: #931723 #938723 #938728
Cross-References: CVE-2015-3183 CVE-2015-3185 CVE-2015-4000
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
Apache2 was updated to fix security issues.
- CVE-2015-3185: The ap\_some\_auth\_required function in server/request.c in
the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x did not consider that a Require directive
may be associated with an authorization setting rather than an
authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the
presence
of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior. [bnc#938723]
- CVE-2015-3183: The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache
HTTP Server did not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote
attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted
request, related to mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid
chunk-extension characters in modules/http/http\_filters.c. [bnc#938728]
On openSUSE 13.1:
- CVE-2015-4000: Fix Logjam vulnerability: change the default
SSLCipherSuite cipherstring to disable export cipher suites and deploy
Ephemeral Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) ciphers. Adjust
'gensslcert' script to generate a strong and unique Diffie Hellman Group
and append it to the server certificate file [bnc#931723].
Patch Instructions:

If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-28 12:03:26 UTC  ``` This issue was actually fixed in version 2.4.13.  However, as versions 2.4.13, 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 were not released, 2.4.16 is the first released upstream version that includes the fix.  Upstream bug report for this issue:  <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57531>  Upstream commit (in 2.4.x branch) fixing the problem:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1668879>   Upstream notes that the issue only affected version starting with 2.4.11, which includes the following fix:    *) core: Support custom ErrorDocuments for HTTP 501 and 414 status codes.      PR 57167 [Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]  Upstream bug report:  <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57167>  Upstream commit (in 2.4.x branch):  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1638071>  This adds an ap_die() call to ap_read_request(), which eventually leads to the NULL pointer dereference issue for which [CVE-2015-0253](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0253) was assigned.   The above change is not include in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and earlier httpd packages, therefore they are not affected by this issue.  This issue causes httpd child process crash.  When using prefork MPM, such crash only affects attacker's connection.  For other MPMs, connections of other users may be affected.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-28 12:05:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7; JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1 and 2; JBoss Web Server 3; and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c5)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-30 00:51:50 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

The server serves as a reverse proxy to an internal GlassFish application server using mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http.  The configuration (somewhat simplified) looks like:    <VirtualHost _default_:443>     # standard SSL configuration ...     SSLProxyEngine on     <Location /some-service/>         ProxyPass <https://appserv.example.com:8181/some-service/> 	Require ip 192.0.2.0/24     </Location>     <Location /other-service/>         ProxyPass <https://appserv.example.com:8181/other-service/> 	Require all granted     </Location>     ProxyPassReverse / <https://appserv.example.com:8181/>   </VirtualHost>  After applying patch openSUSE-2015-635, proxying stopped working: if the internal server replies with chunked transfer encoding, the Apache proxy truncates this reply to zero (but still sends this empty reply to the client with a 200 HTTP status code). ``` [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=938728#c38)  Petr Gajdos   2015-10-08 14:35:06 UTC  ``` Rolf thank you, but we know this already, see [bug 949218](show_bug.cgi?id=949218 "RESOLVED FIXED - after update to apache2 2.4.6-6.50.1 the PHP $_POST variable is not populated with data from multipart forms"). ``` [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=938728#c39)  Rolf Krahl   2015-10-08 18:13:43 UTC  ``` Thanks for the hint Petr!

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
and extensible web server.

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function
ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was
authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using
this API function could consequently allow access that should have been
denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd service will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1228611#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-06-05 10:23:49 UTC  ``` The following was reported by OpenSSL upstream:  This vulnerability does not affect current versions of OpenSSL. It existed in previous OpenSSL versions and was fixed in June 2014.  If a DTLS peer receives application data between the ChangeCipherSpec and Finished messages, buffering of such data may cause an invalid free, resulting in a segmentation fault or potentially, memory corruption.  This issue affected older OpenSSL versions 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.  OpenSSL 0.9.8 DTLS users should upgrade to 0.9.8za OpenSSL 1.0.0 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.0m. OpenSSL 1.0.1 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.1h.  This issue was originally reported on March 28th 2014 in <https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3286> by Praveen Kariyanahalli, and subsequently by Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert (Google). A fix was developed by zhu qun-ying.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1228611#c1)  Huzaifa S.
