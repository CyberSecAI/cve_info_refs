Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect parsing of multi-keyword mode cipherstrings within the `nss_compat_ossl` component. Specifically, the parsing logic fails to properly interpret combinations of keywords like "ECDH+SHA," leading to the selection of an unexpected and potentially larger set of ciphers than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Cipherstring Parsing:** The core weakness is in the flawed implementation of the multi-keyword cipherstring parsing logic. It doesn't correctly map keyword combinations to their intended cipher suites.
- **Unexpected Cipher Suite Selection:**  Due to the parsing error, a user specifying a concise cipher string like "ECDH+SHA" might inadvertently activate a much broader and potentially less secure range of ciphers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Downgrade Attacks:**  An attacker might be able to exploit this vulnerability to force a server or client to use weaker, less secure cipher suites than intended by the administrator.
- **Potential for Exposure:** By allowing weaker ciphers, an attacker may be able to eavesdrop on encrypted communications, or potentially perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the cipher string that is configured on a server or client, either through a configuration file or through an API. 
- This would cause the vulnerable software to pick a weaker cipher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the cipher string configuration of an affected system.
- This could involve direct access to configuration files, or by manipulating the software through some interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report provides specific examples of the incorrect cipher selection, showing how a combination like `ECDH+SHA` results in a significantly larger list of ciphers than expected.
- The issue was reported by Martin Poole of Software Maintenance Engineering group.
- The bug was closed as WONTFIX, implying that the issue is unlikely to be addressed directly.
