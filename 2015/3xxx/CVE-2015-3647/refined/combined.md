  The quick setup screen

## Blocks

This plugin provides 5 blocks.

* WPPA slideshow
* WPPA+ photo
* WPPA general
* WPPA potd
* WPPA Upload

## Installation

* Standard from the plugins page

#### Requirements

* The theme should have a call to wp\_head() in its header.php file and wp\_footer() in its footer.php file.
* The theme should load enqueued scripts in the header if the scripts are enqueued without the $in\_footer switch (like wppa.js and jQuery).
* The theme should not prevent this plugin from loading the jQuery library in its default wp manner, i.e. the library jQuery in safe mode (uses jQuery() and not $()).
* The theme should not use remove\_action() or remove\_all\_actions() when it affects actions added by wppa+.

  Most themes comply with these requirements.

  However, check these requirements in case of problems with new installations with themes you never had used before with wppa+ or when you modified your theme.
* The server should have at least 64MB of memory.

## FAQ

### What do i have to do when converting to multisite?

* See [the installation notes](https://wppa.nl/changelog/installation-notes/#multisite)

### Which other plugins do you recommend to use with WPPA+, and which not?

* Recommended plugins: qTranslate, Comet Cache, Cube Points, Simple Cart & Buy Now.
* Plugins that break up WPPA+: My Live Signature.
* Google Analytics for WordPress will break the slideshow in most cases when *Track outbound clicks & downloads:* has been checked in its configuration.

### Which themes have problems with wppa+ ?

* Photocrati has a problem with the wppa+ embedded lightbox when using page templates with sidebar.

### Are there special requirements for responsive (mobile) themes?

* No, WPPA+ is responsive by default

### After update, many things seem to go wrong

* After an update, always clear your browser cache (CTRL+F5) and clear your temp internetfiles, this will ensure the new versions of js files will be loaded.
* And – most important – if you use a server side caching program (like W3 Total Cache) clear its cache.
* Make sure any minifying plugin (like W3 Total Cache) is also reset to make sure the new version files are used.
* Visit the Photo Albums -> Settings page -> Table VIII-A1 and press Do it!
* When upload fails after an upgrade, one or more columns may be added to one of the db tables. In rare cases this may have been failed.

  Unfortunately this is hard to determine.

  If this happens, make sure (ask your hosting provider) that you have all the rights to modify db tables and run action Table VII-A1 again.

### How does the search widget work?

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: https://wppa.nl/docs-by-subject/search/regular-search/

### How can i translate the plugin into my language?

* See the translators handbook: https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/
* Here is the polyglot page for this plugin: https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-photo-album-plus

### How do i install a hotfix?

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: https://wppa.nl/docs-by-subject/development-version/

Our website has used this plugin for our Photography galleries for some time now. It is the best one out there in my opinion.
The author Jacob is very pro-active and extremely helpful, resolving issues very quickly.
Highly recommended plugin.

Plugin is great and really powerful with lots of settings. But it ”eats” a lot of memory so other plugins stopped working. I do not need all those numerous settings, I just need a gallery with possibility for users to download and comment pictures from frontend, so I decided to look for another decision. I`ve made contribution in translating this plugin into Ukrainian. Wish you luck 🙂

I wanted to display my photo on my website by allowing users to select an album with photos grouped by category (B&W, Landscape, People, etc.) from which they would see a gallery of thumbnails of all the images. By clicking on the thumbnail they could see a larger version of the image. Finally, if they are interested in buying the image they can click on the large version which takes them to my third-party order fulfillment site. WP Photo Album Plus was the only plugin the could provide this type of functionality that I could find. It works great. The developer, Jacob N. Breetvelt, is very responsive and helpful also if there is ever an issue or question. I highly recommend this plugin.

I use WP Photo Album Plus for the presentation of historical postcards. It is a fantastically powerful tool with a lot of possibilities. Especially the mass import of images with the corresponding data as CSV file were crucial for me. But the other functions are also impressive with very many setting options.
Furthermore, the very fast support for questions of understanding or also function extensions is extremely good. Many thanks to Jakob and the other supporters.

Already 6000 albums and nearly 50000 photos in my website and it works perfectly, and “cherry on the cake” the support is very responsive and open to changes.
Great plugin, great developer.
