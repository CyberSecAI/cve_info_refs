The provided content is a message from the oss-security mailing list requesting CVEs for multiple Drupal contributed module vulnerabilities. Specifically, the email mentions a correction regarding "SA-CONTRIB-2015-031 - GD Infinite Scroll" which should be discarded in favor of "SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite".

CVE-2015-3363 is not specifically mentioned within the email. However, this email is part of a request for CVEs to be assigned to Drupal module vulnerabilities discovered in January 2015.

Based on the information provided, here are the vulnerabilities for Drupal modules from the email, but it is not possible to isolate specific information related to CVE-2015-3363. It appears to be related to "SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - Open Redirect", but this is a correction from "SA-CONTRIB-2015-031 - GD Infinite Scroll" which was originally mentioned in error for an Open Redirect issue. 

**Vulnerabilities present:**

The email outlines the following types of vulnerabilities across various Drupal modules:
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   SQL Injection
*   Open Redirect
*   Access bypass
*   Information disclosure

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact varies based on the specific vulnerability type.
*   CSRF could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a victim.
*   XSS could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   SQL injection could allow an attacker to read, modify or delete data from the database.
*   Open Redirect could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Access bypass allows attackers to access functionality or data without proper authorization.
*   Information disclosure allows attackers to gain access to sensitive data

**Attack vectors:**
*   Web based attacks through the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For XSS and Open Redirect: attacker needs to inject malicious code in user browser.
*   For CSRF: Attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into sending a malicious request.
*   For SQL Injection: Requires ability to interact with the application by injecting SQL code into input parameters
*   For Access bypass: Exploitation might require specific module configuration or user roles, but in general an attacker that can interact with the website.
*   For Information disclosure: An attacker needs to have a way to access vulnerable resources.
