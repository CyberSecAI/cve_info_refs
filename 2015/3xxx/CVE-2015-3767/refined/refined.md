The provided content relates to CVE-2015-3767.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory corruption issue existed in the parsing of malformed DMG images within the `udf` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that occurs when handling malformed DMG images. This is due to insufficient validation or handling of the data within the DMG file.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution with system privileges. This means an attacker could potentially take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through processing a maliciously crafted DMG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious DMG file to the target system, and the system must attempt to parse this file. A local user is needed to trigger this vulnerability.
