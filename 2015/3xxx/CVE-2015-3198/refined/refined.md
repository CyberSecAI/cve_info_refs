Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3198:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the Undertow web server (used in WildFly) handles URLs with trailing slashes when accessing JSP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **JSP Source Code Exposure:** When a trailing slash is appended to a JSP file's URL (e.g., `index.jsp/`), the server incorrectly serves the raw JSP source code instead of processing it and rendering the output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the JSP source code, which may contain sensitive information, including:
    - Database credentials
    - API keys
    - Passwords to external systems
    - Business logic
- **Security Risk:** The exposure of such sensitive data can lead to further attacks, such as:
    - Unauthorized access to databases or systems
    - Data breaches
    - Compromise of application functionality

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is simple:
    - Appending a `/` to the end of a JSP file URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server. They don't require any prior authentication or special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was initially reported on Stack Overflow and subsequently tracked as `WFLY-4595` in the JBoss issue tracker.
- The vulnerability was present in WildFly versions 8.1.0.Final, 8.2.0.Final, and 9.0.0.CR1.
- The fix was included in WildFly 9.0.0.CR2 and 10.0.0.Alpha1 by upgrading undertow.
- The fix in Undertow involves adding a check for trailing slashes in the URL and returning a 404 error in such cases, preventing access to the source code.
- The vulnerability does not affect JBoss EAP as it uses JBoss Web instead of Undertow web module.
