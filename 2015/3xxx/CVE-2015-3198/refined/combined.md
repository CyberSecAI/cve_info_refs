* **Git Pull Request:**

### Description

When a trailing slash is added to a JSP URL (e.g. localhost:8080/my-app/index.jsp/) the source code of the JSP is downloaded/displayed.

This is a security issue, because users can have passwords to external systems directly stored in JSP source code.

This was originally reported by Abhinav Gupta on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30028346/with-trailing-slash-in-url-jsp-show-source-code)

we have application deployed over wildfly 8.1 . All works fine for jsps , but whenever I put a slash , browser shows source code of jsp. This is an issue from security.

Can I handle this at wildfly or undertow configuration level .

For example :

localhost:8080/TaskManager/login.jsp/ - show jsp source code

localhost:8080/TaskManager/login.jsp - works perfect

One solution I am aware of is to put all my jsp inside WEB-INF , but I am looking to handle it at server level.

If it possible , if yes how ? Please help

Thanks,
Abhinav

* I am able to reproduce this issue with wildfly logging quickstart. If I use URL , [localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp(+](http://localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp%28%2B) slash) - I see content of jsp.. And [localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp](http://localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp) and this works fine. Shared war file at [dropbox.com/s/8qbec3n22btg7mf/jboss-logging.war?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qbec3n22btg7mf/jboss-logging.war?dl=0) Please have a look once you have some time available . Thanks in advance for helping me here.

This seems to be a serious issue in the Undertow (web subsystem in the WildFly) - I've reported it in the WildFly issue tracker: **[WFLY-4595](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-4595)**

Servlet filter class have do filter method.
this method write below code.

```
    Example:
    String url = req.getRequestURL().toString();
    if(url.endsWith("/"))
       {
    ((HttpServletResponse) response).setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_MOVED_PERMANENTLY);
    ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(contextPath + ERROR_PAGE);
    return;
    }

```

# [With trailing slash in URL , jsp show source code](/message/927301#927301)

**[abhinav.gupta01](/people/abhinav.gupta01)** Apr 29, 2015 7:18 AM

Hi All,

we have application deployed over wildfly 8.1 . All works fine for jsps , but whenver I put a slash , broswer shows source code of jsp. This is an issue from security.

Can I handle this at wildfly or undertow configuration level .

For example :

<http://localhost:8080/TaskManager/login.jsp/> - show jsp source code

[http://localhost:8080/TaskManager/login.jsp - works perfect](http://localhost:8080/TaskManager/login.jsp/)

One solution I am aware of is to put all my jsp inside WEB-INF , but I am looking to handle it at server level.

Id it possible , if yes how ? Please help

Thanks,

Abhinav

  Hello Tomaz,

  I am able to reproduce this issue with wildfly logging quickstart.

  If I use URL , <http://localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp/> - I see content of jsp..

  And [http://localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp](http://localhost:8080/jboss-logging/home.jsp/) and this works fine.

  Shared war file at <https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qbec3n22btg7mf/jboss-logging.war?dl=0>

  Please have a look once you have some time available .

  Thanks in advance for helping me here.

  Same question I posted on stackoverflow :

  Thanks All.

  This is a bug on undertow server. I check master branch and fix is merge TODAY..

  I picked io.undertow.servlet.handlers.DefaultServlet from master and see below is change for that :

  if(path.endsWith("/")) {

  //UNDERTOW-432

  resp.sendError(404);

  return;

  }

  As a workaround for now , I pick source of undertow for 8.1 WildFly version , add above code in that and add new class file to my existing jar. This solve issue.

  I am not sure what is process to get patch for this in wildfly .. for both 8.1 Final and 8.2 Final release. If some one is aware of please enlighten me.

  Thanks

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1224787#c0)  Fabio Olive Leite    2015-05-25 17:48:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported in the Undertow module of WildFly that leaks the source code of a JSP page when a trailing slash (/) is added to the end of its URL.  This issue did not affect any versions of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform because this flaw only affects the Undertow web module; JBoss EAP uses JBoss Web.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1224787#c1)  Fabio Olive Leite    2015-05-25 17:53:32 UTC  ``` References: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-4595>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1224787#c3)  Timothy Walsh    2015-07-22 12:11:00 UTC  ``` Confirmed this is not a problem for EAP 6.4.x.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1224787#c4)  Timothy Walsh    2015-07-22 12:14:21 UTC  ``` Marking this as closed.  It has been fixed in WildFly 9.0.0.CR2, 10.0.0.Alpha1.   ``` |  |
