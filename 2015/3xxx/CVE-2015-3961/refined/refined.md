Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-3961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the external control of an assumed-immutable web parameter. By crafting a specific URL request to the device's web server, an attacker can trigger memory corruption, leading to a device reboot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of web parameters, specifically allowing external control of parameters that should be immutable.
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to the above weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a device reboot, disrupting its operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the device's web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable device's web server.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (CVSS: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S). The vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated attackers, but requires "authenticated access to the device".
