Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-3227

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the XML processing within the Active Support component of Ruby on Rails. Specifically, the issue arises when using either REXML or JDOM as the XML parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted XML Depth:** The REXML and JDOM XML processors do not properly limit the depth of XML documents, leading to excessive memory consumption when processing deeply nested XML structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted XML document with a very deep nesting structure can cause the application to raise a `SystemStackError`, potentially leading to a denial-of-service by exhausting system resources and crashing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** An attacker can send a specially crafted XML document to an application that uses Active Support with REXML or JDOM as the XML processor. This XML document will have an extremely deep nesting structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests containing the malicious XML payload to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing XML with REXML or JDOM. Other XML processors like Nokogiri or LibXML are not affected.
- The issue is a lack of depth checking in the XML parsing logic.
- Patches were provided to mitigate the issue by implementing depth checking on XML documents.
- Workarounds involve either changing the XML parser to a non-vulnerable one (Nokogiri, LibXML) or by adjusting `RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE`.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of Ruby on Rails prior to the fixed versions are affected.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Ruby on Rails versions 4.2.2, 4.1.11 and later versions contain the fix.
