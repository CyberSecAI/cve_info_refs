- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sinapsi eSolar Light application stores passwords in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext storage of passwords (CWE-256). The passwords for the DNS and mail configuration can be viewed by accessing the mail configuration page source.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Access to the plaintext passwords compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the mail client. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to the system, modify settings, or intercept sensitive communication.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user needs to access the mail configuration option to view the passwords. Low skill is required for the exploit.
