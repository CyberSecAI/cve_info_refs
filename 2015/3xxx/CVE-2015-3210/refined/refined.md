{
  "CVE-2015-3210": {
    "Root cause": "Heap buffer overflow in the PCRE library during the compilation of a malformed regular expression.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The PCRE library's `compile_regex` function writes more data onto a malloced block than its intended size, leading to a heap overflow. This occurs during the compilation of crafted regex patterns."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by using advanced heap feng shui techniques. Additionally, the vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the affected application.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a malformed regular expression to the PCRE library via an application that uses it (e.g., PHP, MariaDB).",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to make the vulnerable application process a specially crafted regular expression. For example, by injecting malicious regex into database queries or other user provided data that will be processed by PCRE.",
  }
}
