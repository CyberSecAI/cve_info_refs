Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3409:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from `Module::Signature` incorrectly handling module loading during signature verification. Specifically, it was possible to load modules from relative paths within the `@INC` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uncontrolled Module Loading:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization when loading Perl modules. The `@INC` array contains directories where Perl searches for modules. By adding a relative path (like `.`) to `@INC`, a malicious actor could make Perl load a module from the current directory which is usually under control of the attacker.
- **Insecure Path Handling**: The module loading mechanism does not enforce absolute paths, allowing relative paths to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who could provide a malicious module could cause arbitrary code to execute within the context of the signature verification process. This is due to the ability to load arbitrary modules from attacker controlled locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Module Delivery:**  A remote attacker provides a malicious Perl module as part of a package being verified.
- **Manipulation of the SIGNATURE file:** The attacker manipulates the `SIGNATURE` file to influence the module loading behavior of `Module::Signature`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide a Malicious Module:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted module that will be loaded during the signature verification process. This could be achieved by compromising a distribution on CPAN or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Control over SIGNATURE File:** The attacker needs to have a way to manipulate the `SIGNATURE` file so the malicious module is loaded during verification.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves ensuring that only absolute paths are used when loading modules from `@INC` during the signature verification process. Specifically, `local @INC = grep { File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute($_) } @INC;`  was added to the `_verify` subroutine. This filters the `@INC` array to include only entries that are absolute paths.
- Modules like `Text::Diff` were specifically mentioned as an example where this vulnerability could be exploited if they were included in a malicious module.
- This vulnerability was discovered by John Lightsey, alongside other related vulnerabilities in `Module::Signature`.
