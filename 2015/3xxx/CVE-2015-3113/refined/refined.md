Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3113:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2015-3113 and its associated vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. The descriptions consistently refer to a heap-based buffer overflow that can lead to arbitrary code execution, which aligns with the official CVE description. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow in Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. This implies that when Flash Player allocates memory on the heap to process a specific SWF file, a specially crafted file can cause the software to write past the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can take control of the affected system. Other impacts mentioned include denial of service, unauthorized information disclosure and bypassing security restrictions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, exploiting the vulnerability via specially crafted SWF files, that can be loaded from a web browser or other application using Flash.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted SWF file and have a victim load the SWF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Flash Player. This can be accomplished through a website or any other mechanism using the Flash Plugin. Attackers do not need any authentication or special privileges. The vulnerability is known to have been exploited in the wild via limited, targeted attacks, especially on systems running Internet Explorer for Windows 7 and below, as well as Firefox on Windows XP.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Specific Versions Affected:** The vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player versions before 13.0.0.296 and 14.x through 18.x before 18.0.0.194 on Windows and OS X, and before 11.2.202.468 on Linux.
*   **Active Exploitation:**  The provided content mentions that the vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild in June 2015.
*   **Targeted Systems:** Specific systems mentioned as known targets are Internet Explorer on Windows 7 and below, and Firefox on Windows XP.
*   **Vendor Fixes:** Adobe has released security updates to address this critical vulnerability and these updates resolve a heap buffer overflow vulnerability that could lead to code execution (CVE-2015-3113).
*   **SUSE and Red Hat Responses:** Both SUSE and Red Hat released security advisories (e.g., SUSE-SU-2015:1136-1, RHSA-2015:1184) addressing the vulnerability, and provided updated packages that include Flash Player version 11.2.202.468 (for Linux).
*   **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 10 (highest) and a CVSS v3 score of 9.8. The high scores indicate critical impact and a low attack complexity.

**Summary of Findings:**

The content accurately and thoroughly describes the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-3113). It details the attack vector, impact, and affected versions and provides information about vendor responses, including specific patch versions for various Linux distributions. The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, without requiring user authentication or interaction and allows the attacker to gain full control of affected systems.
