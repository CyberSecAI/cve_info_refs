Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SharedReviewDocCenterInitiator onError` event within Adobe Reader. Specifically, the way the JavaScript API restrictions are enforced during the handling of this event is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JavaScript API Restriction Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to circumvent the intended limitations on the JavaScript API within Adobe Reader through the manipulation of the `SharedReviewDocCenterInitiator onError` event.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This can lead to complete system compromise including data exfiltration, installation of malware, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** A specially crafted PDF document with specific JavaScript instructions is used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Web Page:**  The target could be lured to a malicious website that attempts to exploit the vulnerability, possibly by embedding the malicious PDF or using other techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote; they do not require physical access to the target system.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, as the victim has to open the malicious PDF or visit a malicious web page to be exploited.
- **Crafting a Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs the ability to create a PDF document containing specific JavaScript code designed to bypass the API restrictions in Adobe Reader.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe released updates to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by filter ID '19338'.

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially compromise the target system due to a flaw in how Adobe Reader handles JavaScript API restrictions when dealing with a specific event which can be exploited by crafting a PDF document or through visiting a malicious website.
