Subject:  CVE-2015-3206 python-kerberos: checkPassword() does not verify KDC authenticity

Hello!

Red Hat has assigned CVE-2015-3206 to the following issue:

<https://www.calendarserver.org/ticket/833>
"The python-kerberos checkPassword() does verify that it actually spoke
to a trusted KDC"

Upstream has not fixed it, rather documented the insecurity of the
checkPassword() function. We feel that this is not a proper solution
given the fact that the pykerberos fork of this library did fix this
issue by adding KDC validation:

<https://github.com/02strich/pykerberos/commit/02d13860b25fab58e739f0e000bed0067b7c6f9c>

Red Hat bug:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1223802>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-21 13:17:59 UTC  ``` The python-kerberos checkPassword() function does not verify that the KDC that it is authenticating with is the one that it intended to communicate with. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof a KDC when an application using python-kerberos attempts to verify a password via the checkPassword() function.  This issue is tracked upstream in <https://www.calendarserver.org/ticket/833> , however it was resolved by documenting the shortcomings of the checkPassword() function: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kerberos> .  The pykerberos library (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykerberos>), a fork of python-kerberos, does include KDC validation support. This change should be backported to python-kerberos to avoid various other application that rely on checkPassword() from having to replace the checkPassword() with a more secure alternative.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-21 13:24:24 UTC  ```  Created python-kerberos tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1223808](show_bug.cgi?id=1223808 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-3206 python-kerberos: checkPassword() does not verify KDC authenticity [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1223809](show_bug.cgi?id=1223809 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-3206 python-kerberos: checkPassword() does not verify KDC authenticity [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-21 13:28:00 UTC  ``` KDC support was implemented in pykerberos with:  <https://github.com/02strich/pykerberos/commit/02d13860b25fab58e739f0e000bed0067b7c6f9c>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c5)  Rob Crittenden    2015-07-09 20:58:16 UTC  ``` Can someone explain what the security issue is?  It isn't like the password is sent in clear text, so no worries there.  All checkPassword() does is return a boolean yes/no, so at worst you get a bad answer back on whether the password is right or not. You'd get real confirmation if the user actually tried to do something with it.  In any case, the solution won't fix the majority of cases since it requires a keytab to do the verification. If a user already had a keytab why are they using a password? If they don't have a keytab, they probably don't have read access to /etc/krb5.keytab, so they're still hosed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-09 21:27:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Rob Crittenden from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c5)) > Can someone explain what the security issue is? >  > It isn't like the password is sent in clear text, so no worries there. >  > All checkPassword() does is return a boolean yes/no, so at worst you get a > bad answer back on whether the password is right or not. You'd get real > confirmation if the user actually tried to do something with it.  The problem is we can't guarantee that, there are possible scenarios (unlikely, but not impossible) that could allow exploitation of this. Additionally this is a security feature that fails to work as advertised (e.g. similar to failing to do SSL hostname checks), thus qualifying for a CVE on both counts.   Having said all this, it is difficult at best to exploit and this issue will be closed as WONTFIX.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1223802#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-09 21:28:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of python-kerberos as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. Additionally this issue is difficult to exploit in most common scenarios (due to the need for a valid Kerberos TGT)c For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

*res@…* originally submitted this as *[ticket:833](https://trac.calendarserver.org/ticket/833)*

---

The python-kerberos checkPassword() method is badly insecure. It does a kinit (AS-REQ) to ask a KDC for a TGT for the given user principal, and interprets the success or failure of that as indicating whether the password is correct. It does not, however, verify that it actually spoke to a trusted KDC: an attacker may simply reply instead with an AS-REP which matches the password he just gave you.

Imagine you were verifying a password using LDAP authentication rather than Kerberos: you would, of course, use TLS in conjunction with LDAP to make sure you were talking to a real, trusted LDAP server. The same requirement applies here. kinit is not a password-verification service.

The usual way of doing this is to take the TGT you've obtained with the user's password, and then obtain a ticket for a principal for which the verifier has keys (e.g. a web server processing a username/password form login might get a ticket for its own HTTP/host@REALM principal), which it can then verify. Note that this requires that the verifier have its own Kerberos identity, which is mandated by the symmetric nature of Kerberos (whereas in the LDAP case, the use of public-key cryptography allows anonymous verification).

If this is not implemented, the documentation should at least indicate that there is no protection against KDC spoofing attacks here.
