Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the kernel's handling of the `pioctl` function for OSD (Object Storage Device) commands within the OpenAFS client. Specifically, when returning the result of the RPC, the kernel used a pointer to the wrong in-kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect memory pointer:** The kernel used a pointer to an incorrect memory location to store and return the result of the `pioctl` operation, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Kernel Memory Corruption:** Due to the incorrect pointer, the kernel could potentially overwrite unrelated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Panic:** A local user can trigger a kernel panic, causing a system crash and denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** The incorrect memory access could corrupt kernel memory, potentially leading to unpredictable system behavior or security compromises beyond a simple denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** A local user needs the ability to execute the OSD FS command using `pioctl` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user with local access to the OpenAFS client. They don't necessarily need root privileges, but do require the ability to execute the specific `pioctl` command that triggers the bug.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in the OpenAFS kernel client that can be triggered by a local user. It allows for a kernel panic or potentially further memory corruption due to a flawed memory pointer being used when handling certain `pioctl` commands.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue is included in OpenAFS version 1.6.13 and later. A patch is also provided for systems where an upgrade is not immediately feasible.
- The vulnerability affects OpenAFS versions 1.0.3 through 1.6.12.
- The provided advisory from openafs.org provides more details than the CVE description.
