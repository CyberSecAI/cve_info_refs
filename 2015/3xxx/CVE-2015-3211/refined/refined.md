Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3211:

**Root Cause:**
- The `php-fpm` package creates the `/var/log/php-fpm` directory with `apache:root` ownership and `770` permissions, rather than `root:root`. This allows the `apache` user to create files and directories within it before the `php-fpm` service starts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Attack:** An attacker, specifically a user with `apache` privileges, can create a symlink within the `/var/log/php-fpm` directory, pointing to an arbitrary file on the system.
- **Log Injection:** Once the `php-fpm` service starts, it will attempt to write log data to the symlinked file, potentially overwriting or appending data to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Modification/Data Corruption:** An attacker can overwrite or append to any file on the system that the `apache` user has access to.  This can lead to corruption of system files, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities, depending on the target file.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While the immediate vulnerability doesn't provide privilege escalation, corrupting configuration files or injecting code via log data could be a step towards further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must have local access and be able to execute commands with the privileges of the `apache` user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute commands as the `apache` user.
- The vulnerability exists during a short window, right after the php-fpm package is installed and before the php-fpm service is started for the first time.
- The attacker must be aware of this condition to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content states that the vulnerability is considered low-to-none impact because of the specific preconditions, thus the decision to not fix it as of the time of the report.
- The vulnerability occurs because the initial directory creation is performed with permissions that enable the `apache` user to write to it, whereas the log files themselves are created by the root process and are owned by root with permissions of 0600, preventing unauthorized access to the actual log files.
- The suggested fix was to change the directory ownership to `root:root` which was rejected as it would render the default configuration unusable.
