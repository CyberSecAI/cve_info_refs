Break out of your blog! Create custom fields for dropdowns, images, and more! This plugin gives Wordpress true CMS functionality.
== Description ==
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbRHrdKwo5A
The Custom Content Type Manager (CCTM) allows users to create custom content types (also known as post types) and standardized custom fields for each, including dropdowns, checkboxes, and images and more! This gives WordPress CMS functionality: Break out of your Blog!
You can select multiple images, posts, or media items to be stored in a single field making it easy for you to store a gallery of images or long lists of values. This plugin also lets you export and import your content definitions, making it easy to ensure a similar structure between multiple sites.
Check the site for a [full list of features](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/wiki/Features).
This plugin was written in part for the book [WordPress 3 Plugin Development Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-3-plugin-development-essentials/book), published by Packt.
= Links =
Please use the following links for support and discussion:
\* Please sign up for the CCTM [Mailing List](http://eepurl.com/dlfHg)\* Participate in the [Forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/custom-content-type-manager?forum\_id=10)\* File [Bug reports or Feature Requests](https://github.com/craftsmancoding/custom-content-type-manager/issues).\* Read the [Official documentation](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/)
= Requirements =
\* WordPress 3.3.0 or greater\* PHP 5.2.6 or greater (5.3 recommended, with scandir)\* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater (5.x recommended)
== Installation ==
This plugin uses the standard installation procedure: install the plugin's folder inside of `wp-content/plugins` (make sure the folder is named \*custom-content-type-manager\*).
Here is a typical use-case verbosely for the record:
1. Install this plugin using the traditional WordPress plugin installation, or upload this plugin's folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (ensure that the directory is named \*custom-content-type-manager\*).1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress manager.1. Upon activation you can adjust the plugin settings by clicking the newly created "Custom Content Types" menu item, or click this plugin's "Settings" link on the Plugins page.1. After clicking the Settings link, you will see a list of content types -- there are two built-in types listed: post and page. To test this plugin, try adding a new content type named "movie" by clicking the "Add Custom Content Type" button at the top of the page.1. There are a \*lot\* of options when setting up a new content type, but all the necessary ones are shown on the first page. Pay attention to the "Name", "Show Admin User Interface", and "Public" settings. "Show Admin User Interface" \*must\* be checked in order for you to be able to create or edit new instances of your custom content type. 1. Save the new content by clicking the "Create New Content Type" button.1. Your content type should now be listed under on the main Custom Content Types Manager settings page. Activate your new content type by clicking the blue "Activate" link.1. Once you have activated the content type, you should see a new menu item in the left-hand admin menu. E.g. "Movies" in our example.1. Try adding some custom fields to your new content type by clicking on the "Manage Custom Fields" link on the settings page.1. You can add as many custom fields as you want by clicking the "Add Custom Field" button at the top of the page, e.g. try adding a "plot\_summary" field using a "textarea" input type, and try adding a "rating" dropdown. 1. When you are finished configuring your custom fields, click the "Save Changes" button.1. Now try adding a new instance of your content type ("Movies" in this example). Click the link in the left-hand admin menu to add a movie.1. Your new "Movie" post will have the custom fields you defined.1. If you have added any media custom fields, be sure to upload some images using the WordPress "Media" menu in the left-hand menu.
Please note: if you are upgrading from version 0.8.7 or before, you must \*completely\* uninstall and remove the previous version! This will not delete any of your content, but you should take some notes about the exact names of your content types before doing this. Sorry, I know it's a pain, but I had to correct for limitations in the data structure. See [this Wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/wiki/DeletePostType) for more information.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Please see the online [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/wiki/FAQ) for the most current information.

There are a lot of options available when you create a new content type, only some of them are pictured.4. You can define many different types of custom fields by clicking on the "Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields" link.5. Clicking the "activate" link for any content type will cause its fields to be standardized and it will show up in the administration menus.6. Once you have defined custom fields and associated them with one or more content types, those custom fields will show up when you create or edit a new post.

=0.8.2=\* WordPress 3.0.4 fixed some bugs that affected the functionality of this plugin: now you CAN add custom content posts to WordPress menus.\* WordPress has not recognized the updates to this plugin (apparently due to a glitch), so currently the only way to get the most recent version of this is to check it out via SVN.

== Requirements ==
\* WordPress 3.3 or greater.\* PHP 5.2.6 or greater\* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater
These requirements are tested during WordPress initialization; the plugin will not load if these requirements are not met. Error messaging will fail if the user is using a version of WordPress older than version 2.0.11.
== About ==
This plugin was written in part for the book [WordPress 3 Plugin Development Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-3-plugin-development-essentials/book) published by Packt. The architecture for this plugin was inspired by [MODX](http://modx.com/). You can compare the 2 systems side by side in my book [MODX and WordPress](https://leanpub.com/modx-vs-wordpress)
== Future TO-DO ==
Please see the [Issues page](https://github.com/craftsmancoding/custom-content-type-manager/issues) for active development. See also the [depcrecated page](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/issues/list) at Google Code. All Google Code projects will become read-only on [August 24, 2015](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html).
If you are eager to see a particular feature implemented in a future release, please share your feedback at the official [Issues page](https://github.com/craftsmancoding/custom-content-type-manager/issues)
