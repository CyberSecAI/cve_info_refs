Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation within the Custom Content Type Manager (CCTM) plugin, specifically related to how it handles user input when creating or modifying custom fields. This allows for the injection of malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Injection:** Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as an injection vulnerability, where an attacker can insert malicious code into the application's data stream.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, particularly when defining custom fields, allowing for the injection of malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute any PHP code they choose on the server, granting them full control over the affected WordPress installation.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This could lead to data theft, website defacement, malware injection, and complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Configuration:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the CCTM plugin's settings by an administrator to inject malicious code within a custom field definition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to modify the CCTM plugin settings.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerability within the CCTM plugin to exploit it effectively.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.9.8.6 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is also associated with CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
*   The issue was identified by Iain Wallace (@strawp).
