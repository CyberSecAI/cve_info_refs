The provided content is an email thread requesting CVEs for multiple vulnerabilities in Drupal contributed modules. Specifically, it mentions the following:

*   **SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - Open Redirect** (This is the one that replaces SA-CONTRIB-2015-031)
*   SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - XSS
*   SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - CSRF

The requested CVE, CVE-2015-3365, is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the provided information, the request for a CVE related to SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 likely resulted in CVE-2015-3365. The description of SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 in the email references **Node Invite** and lists XSS, CSRF, and Open Redirect as vulnerabilities. Based on this information, we can say that it is related to CVE-2015-3365.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Open Redirect

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The email does not specify the root cause.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed by other users leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can force a user to perform unwanted actions on a web application that they are authenticated to, such as changing settings or performing transactions.
*   **Open Redirect:** Allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker would inject malicious scripts, possibly through user-supplied inputs that are not properly sanitized.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker would craft a malicious request that the victim's browser would execute without the victim's knowledge or consent.
*   **Open Redirect:** The attacker would manipulate a URL to redirect the victim to an arbitrary external site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs/scripts and convince the victim to interact with them (e.g. by tricking a user to click a link or to fill a form).
* The attacker would need some knowledge about the vulnerable application, or be able to find specific inputs that could trigger these vulnerabilities.
