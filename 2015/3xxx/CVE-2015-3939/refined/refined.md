- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the internal service interface of the IDS RTU 850 communications modules. This allows an attacker to access files they shouldn't.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could access files containing credentials (passwords) to the internal service interface via telnet, which could then be used to escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a high skill level to exploit this vulnerability. The advisory mentions that the attacker requires a "user level" of authentication to exploit this vulnerability (which is not mentioned in the CVE description).
