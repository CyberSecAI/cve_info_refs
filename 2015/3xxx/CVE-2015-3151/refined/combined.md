| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1214451#c0)  Florian Weimer    2015-04-22 18:11:37 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the abrt-dbus D-Bus service contains several directory traversal flaws related to the NewProblem, GetInfo and SetElement methods.  Local attackers could use these flaws to read and write arbitrary files as the root user, or take ownership of arbitrary files and directories.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1214451#c3)  Florian Weimer    2015-04-22 18:15:34 UTC  ```  Created abrt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1214452](show_bug.cgi?id=1214452 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3151 abrt: directory traversals in several D-Bus methods implemented by abrt-dbus [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1214451#c4)  Jakub Filak    2015-05-05 11:28:23 UTC  ``` The following upstream commits fix this cve: <https://github.com/abrt/abrt/commit/c796c76341ee846cfb897ed645bac211d7d0a932> <https://github.com/abrt/abrt/commit/f3c2a6af3455b2882e28570e8a04f1c2d4500d5b> <https://github.com/abrt/libreport/commit/54ecf8d017580b495d6501e53ca54e453a73a364> <https://github.com/abrt/libreport/commit/239c4f7d1f47265526b39ad70106767d00805277>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1214451#c5)  Jakub Filak    2015-05-15 08:43:05 UTC  ``` Martin has found out that DeleteElement method is still vulnerable.
