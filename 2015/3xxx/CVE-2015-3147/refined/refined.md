Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3147:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from multiple sources, including the GitHub commit, Red Hat Bugzilla, and an Openwall mailing list, clearly indicates that this vulnerability is related to the Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT), specifically how it handles uploaded problem reports. The core issue is the lack of validation and sanitization of uploaded files when moving problem reports from a temporary directory to a spool directory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the `abrt-handle-upload` script not verifying the permissions or the existence of symlinks in the new problem directories when moving problem reports. The script moves problem reports from `/var/spool/abrt-upload` to `/var/spool/abrt` or `/var/tmp/abrt` without proper checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Permission Checks:**  The `abrt-handle-upload` script does not verify if the target directories and their contents have the appropriate permissions.
*   **Lack of Symlink Handling:** The script doesn't check if problem directories contain symbolic links. This can lead to a crafted problem report exploiting other parts of ABRT.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Due to a lack of input sanitization, an attacker can leverage the script to overwrite arbitrary files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can use a specially crafted problem report to overwrite any file on the system.
*   **Exposure to other parts of ABRT:**  A malicious problem report can expose other parts of the ABRT tool to further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves creating a malicious problem report in `/var/spool/abrt-upload`.
*   The `abrt-handle-upload` script processes this report, moves the files and directories to the spool locations which, due to lack of validation, makes the malicious content effective.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload:** The attacker needs the capability to upload a crash report to the `/var/spool/abrt-upload` directory.  This typically involves a non-default but documented/supported configuration of ABRT. The default configuration does not allow this by default.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The initial vulnerability report indicates that `abrt-handle-upload` does not verify that the new problem directory has appropriate permissions and does not contain symbolic links.
*   The fix, according to the commit message, involves sanitizing uploaded files and directories, removing symlinks, and ensuring the correct permissions.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry for this CVE (1212953) confirms the vulnerability details and the fix.
*   The mailing list discussion on Openwall describes the vulnerability as being associated with the ABRT upload functionality, which allows a user to create a problem directory with symbolic links and unintended permissions.
*  The Red Hat security advisory (RHSA-2015:1083) mentions that the `abrt-handle-upload` did not verify the permissions and symbolic links of problem directories being moved, allowing overwrite of arbitrary files or exposing other parts of ABRT.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability does not affect default configurations of ABRT, as the `/var/spool/abrt-upload` directory typically has restrictive write permissions. However, in a documented and supported configuration it does become a risk.
*   The issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
*   Upstream commit `3746b7627218438ae7d781fc8b18a221454e9091` addresses this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2015-3147 is a significant security flaw within ABRT's upload handling, where a lack of validation leads to arbitrary file overwrite and exposure of ABRT to attacks. An attacker needs to upload a crafted crash report via non default but documented/supported means in order to exploit this vulnerability.
