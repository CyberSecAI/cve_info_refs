{
  "CVE-2015-3340": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The handler for `XEN_DOMCTL_gettscinfo` failed to initialize a padding field, which was then copied to guest memory. A similar bug existed in `XEN_SYSCTL_getdomaininfolist`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak: Sensitive data related to the hypervisor or other guests could be read from uninitialized padding fields.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Malicious or buggy stub domain kernels or tool stacks could read sensitive data about the hypervisor or other guests, potentially leading to further compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious or buggy service domain (e.g., a device model emulator like qemu-dm) with privilege over another guest could exploit this vulnerability. Specifically, it occurs when a HVM guest with a stub qemu-dm (where the device model runs in a separate domain) exercises the information leak after gaining control of the device model.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control a stub domain kernel or tool stack with privilege over another guest. For example, control over a device model running in a separate domain from the main hypervisor and the target guest."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Xen does not initialize certain fields when handling XEN_DOMCTL_gettscinfo or XEN_SYSCTL_getdomaininfolist requests.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure via uninitialized memory read.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote service domain may be able to obtain sensitive information from memory.",
      "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the XEN_DOMCTL_gettscinfo or XEN_SYSCTL_getdomaininfolist hypercalls.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control a remote service domain."
