Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `python-tlslite` library. Specifically, it occurs during the decryption process of TLS records. The code fails to properly handle cases where a message with an empty payload is received after decryption and IV removal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The `_decryptRecord` function in `tlsrecordlayer.py` did not check for an empty payload after removing the IV. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the padding length (`b[-1]`) on an empty string, causing the program to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malformed TLS packet with an empty payload can cause a runtime exception, effectively crashing the application or service using the vulnerable `python-tlslite` library. This could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker can send a specially crafted TLS message with an empty payload after decryption to a server or client application that uses the vulnerable `python-tlslite` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in the commit `aca8d4f898b436ff6754e1a9ab96cae976c8a853` adds a check for an empty payload after decryption and IV removal. If the payload is empty, it triggers a `decryption_failed` alert instead of trying to access the padding byte on an empty string, preventing the crash.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Vasyl Kaigorodov and was assigned CVE-2015-3220.
*   The fix was included in `python-tlslite` version 0.4.9.
