Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3228:

**Root Cause:**

*   Integer overflow in the `gs_heap_alloc_bytes()` function within the `base/gsmalloc.c` file of Ghostscript. This function calculates the memory to allocate by adding the requested size and the size of a `gs_malloc_block_t` structure. When the requested size is very large, the addition can wrap around, resulting in a smaller allocation than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow vulnerability. The calculation `size + sizeof(gs_malloc_block_t)` can result in a value smaller than `size` due to integer wrapping, leading to a heap overflow.
*   **Heap Overflow:** Because of the integer overflow, `malloc` may be called with a smaller size value than expected. When the allocated buffer is used, this can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a crash of the Ghostscript application due to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By carefully crafting the input file, an attacker can potentially overwrite memory locations and gain arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Ghostscript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted PostScript File:** The vulnerability is triggered when Ghostscript processes a specially crafted PostScript file, often using tools like `ps2pdf`. The file contains binary tokens that cause an immense array allocation, triggering the overflow when calculating allocation size.
*   **User-Assisted Exploitation:** Exploitation typically requires a user or automated system to open or process the malicious PostScript file using a vulnerable version of Ghostscript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create or Modify PostScript Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PostScript file or modify an existing one.
*   **Social Engineering/Access:**  The attacker must be able to get the victim to process this crafted PostScript file, either through social engineering or via an automated processing system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered and reported by William Robinet and Stefan Cornelius.
*   The patch involves adding a sanity check to prevent the integer overflow in `gs_heap_alloc_bytes()`.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2015-3228.
*   The vulnerability affects various distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and Oracle Solaris, among others.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported as a crash and later found to have more serious security implications.
*   The fix in the ghostscript source code is available at `<http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0c0b0859>`
