Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Beaker application's admin pages for key types and power types lacked proper access controls. Specifically, no authentication or authorization checks were performed on these pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The core vulnerability was the absence of access checks on the `/powertypes/` and `/keytypes/` URLs. This allowed unauthorized users to directly access these pages, bypassing intended restrictions.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The application failed to restrict access to administrative functions, like creating and removing power/key types, to only authorized users (administrators).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of System Settings**: Anonymous (unauthenticated) users could create, modify, or remove key and power types. This could allow an attacker to disrupt system operations, potentially leading to denial-of-service, or otherwise impacting the functionality of systems managed by Beaker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The attack vector was direct access to the vulnerable URLs (`/powertypes/` and `/keytypes/`) by navigating to them using a web browser or via an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needed network access to the Beaker instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability could be exploited by an anonymous user without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Beaker version 19 and likely earlier versions, and was fixed in version 20.1
*   The fix involved implementing access controls that return 403 responses when unauthorized access is attempted.
