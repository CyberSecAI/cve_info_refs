- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sailfish OS in Jolla phones does not properly handle spaces within tel URIs when called through an A HREF tag in a website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of spaces in tel URIs leading to phone number spoofing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a victim into calling a different number than intended, potentially leading to premium-rate calls.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious website with a specially crafted A HREF tag containing a tel URI with spaces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to host a website or be able to inject content into a website that a victim would access using their Jolla phone.
