Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Floating Social Bar" version 1.0.1 - 1.1.6 had an AJAX action `wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order` that was intended to be used only by administrators, but could be accessed by unauthenticated users. This allowed non-administrators to adjust the order of social media services displayed by the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The `wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order` action did not correctly enforce access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to execute it.
*   **XSS vulnerability (potentially):** Although not explicitly the vulnerability this CVE addresses, the discussion mentions the possibility of including an XSS payload within the input data when reordering services, which would be a separate vulnerability.  This CVE is assigned to the vulnerability where the services are reordered without an XSS payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized modification:** Attackers could manipulate the order of social media service icons displayed by the plugin. This could cause disruption of the site's layout or make it easier to direct visitors to malicious sites.
*   **CSRF** The discussion mentions that administrators can be forced to execute the action with an attacker's parameters via a CSRF attack, but this is to be assigned a separate CVE ID.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct unauthenticated access:** Attackers could directly send a request to the WordPress site, triggering the vulnerable `wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the site hosting the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The discussion mentions that two separate CVE IDs are being assigned because the XSS payload injection and the order manipulation are considered separate vulnerabilities that could have been fixed independently.
*   The fix includes adding nonces to stop the CSRF attack and presumably a restriction on the user being able to change the order of services unless they are logged in.
