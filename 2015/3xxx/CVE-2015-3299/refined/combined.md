Certainly the CSRF will have its own CVE ID, because it is independent
of whether (and why) wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order existed.

In this specific case, for the direct unauthenticated attacks, we feel
that there can be two CVE IDs for the two different problems with
different types of attacks, i.e., leaving the services in their
original order but including an XSS payload (CVE-2015-3299), and
moving the services to an arbitrary order but omitting an XSS payload.
These conceivably could have been (even though they weren't) fixed
independently:

  add an effective approach against XSS in the input data, but
  ignore the relationship between the new order values and the
  original order values

  versus

  ensure that the order values, when compared numerically, have no
  change from the original values -- but ignore trailing
  non-numeric data

We will send the additional CVE IDs soon unless there is any new
information.
