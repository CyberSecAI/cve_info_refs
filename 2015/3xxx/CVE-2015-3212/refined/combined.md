## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change

(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [922583](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=922583) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [926223](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=926223) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

# CVE-2015-1805

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1804.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1815.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1805 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1805)

#### Description

The (1) pipe\_read and (2) pipe\_write implementations in fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16 do not properly consider the side effects of failed \_\_copy\_to\_user\_inatomic and \_\_copy\_from\_user\_inatomic calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application, aka an "I/O vector array overrun."

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue only affects Linux Kernels with ESPFIX and 16bit segments enabled, and nested NMI sources. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 does not enable ESPFIX or 16bit segments, so it is not affected. SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and older have no sources of nested NMIs, so can not be exploited. Only openSUSE 13.2 and openSUSE Tumbleweed (201508) are affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1226159](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1226159) [NEW], [937969](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=937969) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [937970](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=937970) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [938706](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=938706) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [939207](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939207) [RESOLVED / ], [939269](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939269) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# CVE-2015-1465

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1463.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1472.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1465 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1465)

#### Description

The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.8 does not properly consider the length of the Read-Copy Update (RCU) grace period for redirecting lookups in the absence of caching, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or system crash) via a flood of packets.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c0)  Wade Mealing    2015-06-19 09:44:27 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the kernels implementation of the Berkly Packet Filter. Specially crafted BPF code  may be able to crash the system by creating a situation in which the JIT compiler will fail to correctly optimise the JIT image on the last pass.  This would to the CPU executing instructions  that were not part of the JIT code.  Workaround:  This issue does not affect most systems by default. An administrator would need to have enabled the BPF JIT to be affected.  It can be disabled immediately with the command:  #   echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable  Or it can be disabled for all subsequent boots of the system by setting a value in  /etc/sysctl.d/44-bpf-jit-disable  ## start file ##  net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0  ## end file ##   Resources:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/784> [https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/id=3f7352bf21f8fd7ba3e2fcef9488756f188e12be](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/id%3D3f7352bf21f8fd7ba3e2fcef9488756f188e12be)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c1)  Wade Mealing    2015-06-19 13:18:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Borkmann for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-26 13:38:35 UTC  ``` CVE assigned: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/785>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c6)  Wade Mealing    2015-06-30 04:33:14 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1236946](show_bug.cgi?id=1236946 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2015-4700 kernel: Crafted BPF filters may crash kernel during JIT optimisation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c7)  Wade Mealing    2015-06-30 04:34:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as it does not contain the affected code. This does not affect the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 as it does not enable the affected code at compile time.  This issue affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1233615#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-16 01:20:31 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This issue does not affect most systems by default.

# USN-2714-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

18 August 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change

(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-3212](/security/CVE-2015-3212))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1469-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1469.90](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1469.90)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [928130](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=928130) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [939263](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939263) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1239029#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-03 09:59:29 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET) is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while receiving(recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2)) data over UDP channel, with an incorrect checksum value.  An unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause DoS([CVE-2015-5364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5364)) to a remote system via specially crafted UDP packets.  The [CVE-2015-5366](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5366) issue is also a DoS, but is limited only to the affected application and not the entire system.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1333 CVE-2015-3212 CVE-2015-4692 CVE-2015-4700
                 CVE-2015-5364 CVE-2015-5366 CVE-2015-5697 CVE-2015-5706
                 CVE-2015-5707

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.

CVE-2015-1333

    Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the
    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

CVE-2015-3212

    Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-4692

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-4700

    Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
    crash the system.

CVE-2015-5364

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.

CVE-2015-5366

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.

CVE-2015-5697

    A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.

CVE-2015-5706

    An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-5707

    An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. CVE-2015-1333, CVE-2015-4692 and
CVE-2015-5706 do not affect the wheezy distribution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except CVE-2015-5364 and CVE-2015-5366
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

ufs: Fix possible deadlock when looking up directories
commit 514d748f69c97a51a2645eb198ac5c6218f22ff9 upstream.
Commit e4502c63f56aeca88 (ufs: deal with nfsd/iget races) made ufs
create inodes with I\_NEW flag set. However ufs\_mkdir() never cleared
this flag. Thus if someone ever tried to lookup the directory by inode
number, he would deadlock waiting for I\_NEW to be cleared. Luckily this
mostly happens only if the filesystem is exported over NFS since
otherwise we have the inode attached to dentry and don't look it up by
inode number. In rare cases dentry can get freed without inode being
freed and then we'd hit the deadlock even without NFS export.

ufs: Fix warning from unlock\_new\_inode()
commit 12ecbb4b1d765a5076920999298d9625439dbe58 upstream.
Commit e4502c63f56aeca88 (ufs: deal with nfsd/iget races) introduced
unlock\_new\_inode() call into ufs\_add\_nondir(). However that function
gets called also from ufs\_link() which hands it already initialized
inode and thus unlock\_new\_inode() complains. The problem is harmless but
annoying.
Fix the problem by opencoding necessary stuff in ufs\_link()

commit 93e3bce6287e1fb3e60d3324ed08555b5bbafa89 upstream.
The warning message in prepend\_path is unclear and outdated. It was
added as a warning that the mechanism for generating names of pseudo
files had been removed from prepend\_path and d\_dname should be used
instead. Unfortunately the warning reads like a general warning,
making it unclear what to do with it.
Remove the warning. The transition it was added to warn about is long
over, and I added code several years ago which in rare cases causes
the warning to fire on legitimate code, and the warning is now firing
and scaring people for no good reason.

Commit fd1d0ddf2ae9 (KVM: arm/arm64: check IRQ number on userland

In this case, interrupts ranging from 1020 to 1023 are unuseable,
as they have a special meaning for the GIC CPU interface.

a redundant (and similarily buggy) check in kvm\_set\_irq.

KVM: s390: virtio-ccw: don't overwrite config space values
commit 431dae778aea4eed31bd12e5ee82edc571cd4d70 upstream.
Eric noticed problems with vhost-scsi and virtio-ccw: vhost-scsi
complained about overwriting values in the config space, which
was triggered by a broken implementation of virtio-ccw's config
get/set routines. It was probably sheer luck that we did not hit
this before.
When writing a value to the config space, the WRITE\_CONF ccw will
always write from the beginning of the config space up to and
including the value to be set. If the config space up to the value
has not yet been retrieved from the device, however, we'll end up
overwriting values. Keep track of the known config space and update
if needed to avoid this.
Moreover, READ\_CONF will only read the number of bytes it has been
instructed to retrieve, so we must not copy more than that to the
buffer, or we might overwrite trailing values.

Currently all backward jumps crash for JITed s390x eBPF programs

for negative values the opcode of the jump instruction is overriden
by the negative branch offset an illegal instruction is generated
by the JIT:
000003ff802da378: c01100000002 lgfi %r1,2

Commit ea5f49692575 ("KVM: s390: only one external call may be pending

The injection of an external call will now always fail with -EBUSY
(if none is already pending).
This leads to the following symptoms:
- An external call will be injected but with the wrong "src cpu id",
as this id will not be remembered.
- The target vcpu will not be woken up, therefore the guest will hang if
it cannot deal with unexpected failures of the SIGP EXTERNAL CALL
instruction.
- If an external call is already pending, -EBUSY will not be reported.

x86/PCI: Use host bridge \_CRS info on systems with >32 bit addressing
commit 3d9fecf6bfb8b12bc2f9a4c7109895a2a2bb9436 upstream.
We enable \_CRS on all systems from 2008 and later. On older systems, we
ignore \_CRS and assume the whole physical address space (excluding RAM and
other devices) is available for PCI devices, but on systems that support
physical address spaces larger than 4GB, it's doubtful that the area above
4GB is really available for PCI.
After d56dbf5bab8c ("PCI: Allocate 64-bit BARs above 4G when possible"), we
try to use that space above 4GB \*first\*, so we're more likely to put a
device there.
On Juan's Toshiba Satellite Pro U200, BIOS left the graphics, sound, 1394,
and card reader devices unassigned (but only after Windows had been
booted). Only the sound device had a 64-bit BAR, so it was the only device
placed above 4GB, and hence the only device that didn't work.
Keep \_CRS enabled even on pre-2008 systems if they support physical address
space larger than 4GB.

powerpc/perf: Fix book3s kernel to userspace backtraces
commit 72e349f1124a114435e599479c9b8d14bfd1ebcd upstream.
When we take a PMU exception or a software event we call
perf\_read\_regs(). This overloads regs->result with a boolean that
describes if we should use the sampled instruction address register
(SIAR) or the regs.
If the exception is in kernel, we start with the kernel regs and
backtrace through the kernel stack. At this point we switch to the
userspace regs and backtrace the user stack with perf\_callchain\_user().
Unfortunately these regs have not got the perf\_read\_regs() treatment,
so regs->result could be anything. If it is non zero,
perf\_instruction\_pointer() decides to use the SIAR, and we get issues
like this:
0.11% qemu-system-ppc [kernel.kallsyms] [k] \_raw\_spin\_lock\_irqsave

Notice the bogus \_raw\_spin\_irqsave when we transition from kernel
(system\_call) to userspace (0x7e714). We inserted what was in the SIAR.
Add a check in regs\_use\_siar() to check that the regs in question
are from a PMU exception. With this fix the backtrace makes sense:

tick/idle/powerpc: Do not register idle states with CPUIDLE\_FLAG\_TIMER\_STOP set in periodic mode
commit cc5a2f7b8f39e7db559778f7913a2410257b3e50 upstream.
On some archs, the local clockevent device stops in deep cpuidle states.
The broadcast framework is used to wakeup cpus in these idle states, in
which either an external clockevent device is used to send wakeup ipis
or the hrtimer broadcast framework kicks in in the absence of such a
device. One cpu is nominated as the broadcast cpu and this cpu sends
wakeup ipis to sleeping cpus at the appropriate time. This is the
implementation in the oneshot mode of broadcast.
In periodic mode of broadcast however, the presence of such cpuidle
states results in the cpuidle driver calling tick\_broadcast\_enable()
which shuts down the local clockevent devices of all the cpus and
appoints the tick broadcast device as the clockevent device for each of
them. This works on those archs where the tick broadcast device is a
real clockevent device. But on archs which depend on the hrtimer mode
of broadcast, the tick broadcast device hapens to be a pseudo device.
The consequence is that the local clockevent devices of all cpus are
shutdown and the kernel hangs at boot time in periodic mode.
Let us thus not register the cpuidle states which have
CPUIDLE\_FLAG\_TIMER\_STOP flag set, on archs which depend on the hrtimer
mode of broadcast in periodic mode. This patch takes care of doing this
on powerpc. The cpus would not have entered into such deep cpuidle
states in periodic mode on powerpc anyway. So there is no loss here.

PMC scratch register 41 is used by tegra LP1 resume code for retrieving stored

tegra20\_cpu\_shutdown() (shared by Tegra20 cpuidle driver and platform SMP code),
which is storing CPU1 "resettable" status. It implies strict order of scratch
register usage, otherwise resume function address is lost on Tegra20 after

ARM: kvm: psci: fix handling of unimplemented functions
commit e2d997366dc5b6c9d14035867f73957f93e7578c upstream.
According to the PSCI specification and the SMC/HVC calling
convention, PSCI function\_ids that are not implemented must
return NOT\_SUPPORTED as return value.
Current KVM implementation takes an unhandled PSCI function\_id
as an error and injects an undefined instruction into the guest
if PSCI implementation is called with a function\_id that is not
handled by the resident PSCI version (ie it is not implemented),
which is not the behaviour expected by a guest when calling a
PSCI function\_id that is not implemented.
This patch fixes this issue by returning NOT\_SUPPORTED whenever
the kvm PSCI call is executed for a function\_id that is not
implemented by the PSCI kvm layer.

arm: KVM: force execution of HCPTR access on VM exit
commit 85e84ba31039595995dae80b277378213602891b upstream.
On VM entry, we disable access to the VFP registers in order to
perform a lazy save/restore of these registers.
On VM exit, we restore access, test if we did enable them before,
and save/restore the guest/host registers if necessary. In this
sequence, the FPEXC register is always accessed, irrespective
of the trapping configuration.
If the guest didn't touch the VFP registers, then the HCPTR access
has now enabled such access, but we're missing a barrier to ensure
architectural execution of the new HCPTR configuration. If the HCPTR
access has been delayed/reordered, the subsequent access to FPEXC
will cause a trap, which we aren't prepared to handle at all.
The same condition exists when trapping to enable VFP for the guest.
The fix is to introduce a barrier after enabling VFP access. In the
vmexit case, it can be relaxed to only takes place if the guest hasn't
accessed its view of the VFP registers, making the access to FPEXC safe.
The set\_hcptr macro is modified to deal with both vmenter/vmexit and
vmtrap operations, and now takes an optional label that is branched to
when the guest hasn't touched the VFP registers.

selinux: fix setting of security labels on NFS
commit 9fc2b4b436cff7d8403034676014f1be9d534942 upstream.
Before calling into the filesystem, vfs\_setxattr calls
security\_inode\_setxattr, which ends up calling selinux\_inode\_setxattr in
our case. That returns -EOPNOTSUPP whenever SBLABEL\_MNT is not set.
SBLABEL\_MNT was supposed to be set by sb\_finish\_set\_opts, which sets it
only if selinux\_is\_sblabel\_mnt returns true.
The selinux\_is\_sblabel\_mnt logic was broken by eadcabc697e9 "SELinux: do
all flags twiddling in one place", which didn't take into the account
the SECURITY\_FS\_USE\_NATIVE behavior that had been introduced for nfs
with eb9ae686507b "SELinux: Add new labeling type native labels".
This caused setxattr's of security labels over NFSv4.2 to fail.

intel\_pstate: set BYT MSR with wrmsrl\_on\_cpu()

Commit 007bea098b86 (intel\_pstate: Add setting voltage value for
baytrail P states.) introduced byt\_set\_pstate() with the assumption that
it would always be run by the CPU whose MSR is to be written by it. It
turns out, however, that is not always the case in practice, so modify
byt\_set\_pstate() to enforce the MSR write done by it to always happen on
the right CPU.

mmc: sdhci: fix low memory corruption
commit 62a7f368ffbc13d9aedfdd7aeae711b177db69ac upstream.
When dma mapping (dma\_map\_sg) fails in sdhci\_pre\_dma\_transfer, -EINVAL
is returned. There are 3 callers of sdhci\_pre\_dma\_transfer:
\* sdhci\_pre\_req and sdhci\_adma\_table\_pre: handle negative return
\* sdhci\_prepare\_data: handles 0 (error) and "else" (good) only
sdhci\_prepare\_data is therefore broken. When it receives -EINVAL from
sdhci\_pre\_dma\_transfer, it assumes 1 sg mapping was mapped. Later,
this non-existent mapping with address 0 is kmap'ped and written to:
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001000 (1000 phys) = 22b7d67df2f6d1cf
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001008 (1008 phys) = 63848a5216b7dd95
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001010 (1010 phys) = 330eb7ddef39e427
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001018 (1018 phys) = 8017ac7295039bda
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000001020 (1020 phys) = 8ce039eac119074f
...
So teach sdhci\_prepare\_data to understand negative return values from
sdhci\_pre\_dma\_transfer and disable DMA in that case, as well as for
zero.
It was introduced in 348487cb28e66b032bae1b38424d81bf5b444408 (mmc:
sdhci: use pipeline mmc requests to improve performance). The commit
seems to be suspicious also by assigning host->sg\_count both in
sdhci\_pre\_dma\_transfer and sdhci\_adma\_table\_pre.

sctp: Fix race between OOTB responce and route removal
[ Upstream commit 29c4afc4e98f4dc0ea9df22c631841f9c220b944 ]
There is NULL pointer dereference possible during statistics update if the route
used for OOTB responce is removed at unfortunate time. If the route exists when
we receive OOTB packet and we finally jump into sctp\_packet\_transmit() to send
ABORT, but in the meantime route is removed under our feet, we take "no\_route"
path and try to update stats with IP\_INC\_STATS(sock\_net(asoc->base.sk), ...).
But sctp\_ootb\_pkt\_new() used to prepare responce packet doesn't call
sctp\_transport\_set\_owner() and therefore there is no asoc associated with this
packet. Probably temporary asoc just for OOTB responces is overkill, so just
introduce a check like in all other places in sctp\_packet\_transmit(), where
"asoc" is dereferenced.
To reproduce this, one needs to
0. ensure that sctp module is loaded (otherwise ABORT is not generated)
1. remove default route on the machine
2. while true; do
ip route del [interface-specific route]
ip route add [interface-specific route]
done
3. send enough OOTB packets (i.e. HB REQs) from another host to trigger ABORT
responce
On x86\_64 the crash looks like this:

When limiting phy link speed using "max-speed" to 100mbps or less on a
giga bit phy, phy never completes auto negotiation and phy state
machine is held in PHY\_AN. Fixing this issue by comparing the giga
bit advertise though phydev->supported doesn't have it but phy has
BMSR\_ESTATEN set. So that auto negotiation is restarted as old and

Indication of a single completed packet, marked by txbbs\_skipped
being bigger then zero, in not enough in order to wake up a
stopped TX queue. The completed packet may contain a single TXBB,
while next packet to be sent (after the wake up) may have multiple
TXBBs (LSO/TSO packets for example), causing overflow in queue followed
by WQE corruption and TX queue timeout.
Instead, wake the stopped queue only when there's enough room for the
worst case (maximum sized WQE) packet that we should need to handle after
the queue is opened again.
Also created an helper routine - mlx4\_en\_is\_tx\_ring\_full, which checks

Commit edafc132baac ("xen-netback: making the bandwidth limiter runtime settable")
introduced the capability to change the bandwidth rate limit at runtime.
But it also introduced a possible crashing bug.
If netback receives two XenbusStateConnected without getting the
hotplug-status watch firing in between, then it will try to register the
watches for the rate limiter again. But this triggers a BUG() in the watch
registration code.
The fix modifies connect() to remove the possibly existing packet-rate
watches before trying to install those watches. This behaviour is in line
with how connect() deals with the hotplug-status watch.

mvneta: add forgotten initialization of autonegotiation bits
[ Upstream commit 538761b794c1542f1c6e31eadd9d7aae118889f7 ]
The commit 898b2970e2c9 ("mvneta: implement SGMII-based in-band link state
signaling")
changed mvneta\_adjust\_link() so that it does not clear the auto-negotiation
bits in MVNETA\_GMAC\_AUTONEG\_CONFIG register. This was necessary for
auto-negotiation mode to work.
Unfortunately I haven't checked if these bits are ever initialized.
It appears they are not.
This patch adds the missing initialization of the auto-negotiation bits
in the MVNETA\_GMAC\_AUTONEG\_CONFIG register.
It fixes the following regression:

Unfortunately, Michal's change to fix AP\_VLAN crypto tailroom
caused a locking issue that was reported by lockdep, but only
in a few cases - the issue was a classic ABBA deadlock caused
by taking the mtx after the key\_mtx, where normally they're
taken the other way around.
As the key mutex protects the field in question (I'm adding a
few annotations to make that clear) only the iteration needs
to be protected, but we can also iterate the interface list
with just RCU protection while holding the key mutex.

neigh: do not modify unlinked entries
[ Upstream commit 2c51a97f76d20ebf1f50fef908b986cb051fdff9 ]
The lockless lookups can return entry that is unlinked.
Sometimes they get reference before last neigh\_cleanup\_and\_release,
sometimes they do not need reference. Later, any
modification attempts may result in the following problems:
1. entry is not destroyed immediately because neigh\_update
can start the timer for dead entry, eg. on change to NUD\_REACHABLE
state. As result, entry lives for some time but is invisible
and out of control.
2. \_\_neigh\_event\_send can run in parallel with neigh\_destroy
while refcnt=0 but if timer is started and expired refcnt can
reach 0 for second time leading to second neigh\_destroy and
possible crash.
Thanks to Eric Dumazet and Ying Xue for their work and analyze
on the \_\_neigh\_event\_send change.

sctp: fix ASCONF list handling
[ Upstream commit 2d45a02d0166caf2627fe91897c6ffc3b19514c4 ]
->auto\_asconf\_splist is per namespace and mangled by functions like
sctp\_setsockopt\_auto\_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.
Also, the call to inet\_sk\_copy\_descendant() was backuping
->auto\_asconf\_list through the copy but was not honoring
->do\_auto\_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
different between both sockets.
This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr\_wq\_lock
spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp\_init\_sock()
will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
sctp\_destroy\_sock() can be called without addrq\_wq\_lock. The lock now
will be take on sctp\_close\_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp\_addr\_wq\_timeout\_handler().
Instead of taking the lock on sctp\_sock\_migrate() for copying and
restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
implementing sctp\_copy\_descendant().
Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
default\_auto\_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
locally.

can: fix loss of CAN frames in raw\_rcv
commit 36c01245eb8046c16eee6431e7dbfbb302635fa8 upstream.
As reported by Manfred Schlaegl here
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=143482089824232&w=2
commit 514ac99c64b "can: fix multiple delivery of a single CAN frame for
overlapping CAN filters" requires the skb->tstamp to be set to check for
identical CAN skbs.
As net timestamping is influenced by several players (netstamp\_needed and
netdev\_tstamp\_prequeue) Manfred missed a proper timestamp which leads to
CAN frame loss.
As skb timestamping became now mandatory for CAN related skbs this patch
makes sure that received CAN skbs always have a proper timestamp set.
Maybe there's a better solution in the future but this patch fixes the
CAN frame loss so far.

However, NRIP support itself depends on cpuid Fn8000\_000A\_EDX[NRIPS].
Since skip\_emulated\_instruction() doesn't verify nrip support
before accepting control.next\_rip as valid, avoid writing this
field if support isn't present.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [903967](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903967) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [919007](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919007) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# CVE-2015-3636

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3631.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3644.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3636 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3636)

#### Description

The ping\_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.3 does not initialize a certain list data structure during an unhash operation, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by leveraging the ability to make a SOCK\_DGRAM socket system call for the IPPROTO\_ICMP or IPPROTO\_ICMPV6 protocol, and then making a connect system call after a disconnect.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [929525](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=929525) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [939277](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939277) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [994624](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=994624) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX]

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking

implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote
attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in
the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a
denial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll
functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 file system handled

the "page size > block size" condition when the fallocate zero range
functionality was used. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system. (CVE-2015-0275, Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's keyring implementation would leak

memory when adding a key to a keyring via the add\_key() function. A local
attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system.
(CVE-2015-1333, Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP

implementation handled Address Configuration lists when performing Address
Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could use this flaw to
crash the system via a race condition triggered by setting certain ASCONF
options on a socket. (CVE-2015-3212, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Virtual

Dynamic Shared Object (vDSO) implementation performed address
randomization. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak
kernel memory addresses to user-space. (CVE-2014-9585, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Canonical for reporting the CVE-2015-1333
issue. The CVE-2015-0275 issue was discovered by Xiong Zhou of Red Hat, and
the CVE-2015-3212 issue was discovered by Ji Jianwen of Red Hat
Engineering.

This update provides a build of the kernel-rt package for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.5 that is layered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and fixes
the following issues:

* Fix regression in scsi\_send\_eh\_cmnd()
* boot hangs at "Console: switching to colour dummy device 80x25"
* Update tcp stack to 3.17 kernel
* ksoftirqd high CPU usage due to stray tasklet from ioatdma driver

(BZ#1245345)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The configuration option CONFIG\_RTC\_HCTOSYS was disabled on the realtime

kernel causing the RTC clock to be adjusted with the UTC time even if the
system is configured to set the RTC to the local time. By enabling the
CONFIG\_RTC\_HCTOSYS configuration option, when the system is configured to
use local time, RTC will correctly update with the local time and not try
to use another timezone. (BZ#1248047)

* In the realtime kernel, if a rt\_mutex was taken while in interrupt

context the normal priority inheritance protocol would falsely identify a
deadlock and trigger a kernel crash. The patch that added the rt\_mutex in
this interrupt context was reverted. (BZ#1250649)

All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

An update that solves 21 vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE 13.2 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
Following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2015-3290: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels nested NMI
handler and espfix64 functionalities interacted during NMI processing. A
local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
- CVE-2015-3212: A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux
kernels SCTP implementation handled Address Configuration lists when
performing Address Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could
use this flaw to crash the system via a race condition triggered by
setting certain ASCONF options on a socket.
- CVE-2015-5364: A remote denial of service (hang) via UDP flood with
incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-5366: A remote denial of service (unexpected error returns) via
UDP flood with incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-4700: A local user could have created a bad instruction in the
JIT processed BPF code, leading to a kernel crash (bnc#935705).
- CVE-2015-1420: Race condition in the handle\_to\_path function in
fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass intended
size restrictions and trigger read operations on additional memory
locations by changing the handle\_bytes value of a file handle during the
execution of this function (bnc#915517).
- CVE-2015-4692: The kvm\_apic\_has\_events function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.h
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified
other impact by leveraging /dev/kvm access for an ioctl call
(bnc#935542).
- CVE-2015-4167 CVE-2014-9728 CVE-2014-9730 CVE-2014-9729 CVE-2014-9731:
Various problems in the UDF filesystem were fixed that could lead to
crashes when mounting prepared udf filesystems.
- CVE-2015-4002: drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver
in the Linux kernel did not ensure that certain length values are
sufficiently large, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (system crash or large loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted packet, related to the (1) oz\_usb\_rx and (2)
oz\_usb\_handle\_ep\_data functions (bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4003: The oz\_usb\_handle\_ep\_data function in
drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver in the Linux
kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(divide-by-zero error and system crash) via a crafted packet
(bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4001: Integer signedness error in the oz\_hcd\_get\_desc\_cnf
function in drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozhcd.c in the OZWPAN driver in the
Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet
(bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4036: A potential memory corruption in vhost/scsi was fixed.
- CVE-2015-2922: The ndisc\_router\_discovery function in net/ipv6/ndisc.c
in the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to reconfigure a hop-limit
setting via a small hop\_limit value in a Router Advertisement (RA)
message (bnc#922583).
- CVE-2015-3636: It was found that the Linux kernels ping socket
implementation did not properly handle socket unhashing during spurious
disconnects, which could lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64
architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use
this flaw to crash the system. On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a
local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to escalate
their privileges on the system.
- CVE-2015-2041: net/llc/sysctl\_net\_llc.c in the Linux kernel used an
incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly
have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry (bnc#919007).
- CVE-2015-3339: Race condition in the prepare\_binprm function in
fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges by
executing a setuid program at a time instant when a chown to root is in
progress, and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not yet
stripped.
- CVE-2015-1465: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly consider the length of the Read-Copy Update (RCU) grace period
for redirecting lookups in the absence of caching, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or system
crash) via a flood of packets (bnc#916225).

# USN-2715-1: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerability

18 August 2015

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change

(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-62-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-62.102~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-62.102~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-62-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-62.102~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-62.102~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2713-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

18 August 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change

(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-3212](/security/CVE-2015-3212))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-89-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-89.127](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-89.127)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the kernel's implementation of the Berkeley Packet

Filter (BPF). A local attacker could craft BPF code to crash the system by
creating a situation in which the JIT compiler would fail to correctly
optimize the JIT image on the last pass. This would lead to the CPU
executing instructions that were not part of the JIT code. (CVE-2015-4700,
Important)

* Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking

implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote
attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in
the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a
denial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll
functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 file system handled

the "page size > block size" condition when the fallocate zero range
functionality was used. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system. (CVE-2015-0275, Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's keyring implementation would leak

memory when adding a key to a keyring via the add\_key() function. A local
attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system.
(CVE-2015-1333, Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP

implementation handled Address Configuration lists when performing Address
Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could use this flaw to
crash the system via a race condition triggered by setting certain ASCONF
options on a socket. (CVE-2015-3212, Moderate)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Virtual

Dynamic Shared Object (vDSO) implementation performed address
randomization. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak
kernel memory addresses to user-space. (CVE-2014-9585, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Borkmann for reporting CVE-2015-4700,
and Canonical for reporting the CVE-2015-1333 issue. The CVE-2015-0275
issue was discovered by Xiong Zhou of Red Hat, and the CVE-2015-3212 issue
was discovered by Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering.

This update also fixes several bugs. Refer to the following Knowledgebase
article for further information:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/1614563>

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

sctp: fix ASCONF list handling

```
->auto_asconf_splist is per namespace and mangled by functions like
sctp_setsockopt_auto_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.

Also, the call to inet_sk_copy_descendant() was backuping
->auto_asconf_list through the copy but was not honoring
->do_auto_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
different between both sockets.

This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr_wq_lock
spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp_init_sock()
will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
sctp_destroy_sock() can be called without addrq_wq_lock. The lock now
will be take on sctp_close_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().

Instead of taking the lock on sctp_sock_migrate() for copying and
restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
implementing sctp_copy_descendant().

Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
default_auto_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
locally.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid

## Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change

(ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [linux-image-3.19.0-26-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

sctp: fix ASCONF list handling->auto\_asconf\_splist is per namespace and mangled by functions like
sctp\_setsockopt\_auto\_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.
Also, the call to inet\_sk\_copy\_descendant() was backuping
->auto\_asconf\_list through the copy but was not honoring
->do\_auto\_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
different between both sockets.
This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr\_wq\_lock
spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp\_init\_sock()
will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
sctp\_destroy\_sock() can be called without addrq\_wq\_lock. The lock now
will be take on sctp\_close\_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp\_addr\_wq\_timeout\_handler().
Instead of taking the lock on sctp\_sock\_migrate() for copying and
restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
implementing sctp\_copy\_descendant().
Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
default\_auto\_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
locally.
Fixes: 9f7d653b67ae ("sctp: Add Auto-ASCONF support (core).")
