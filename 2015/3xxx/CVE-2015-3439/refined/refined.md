  "CVE-2015-3439": {
    "description": "The provided data indicates that WordPress versions 3.9 to 4.1.1 are vulnerable to a Same-Origin Method Execution vulnerability via a flaw in plupload. This vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the 'target' GET parameter to execute JavaScript functions. The attacker can install a plugin without admin privileges by using a proxy page to redirect to the vulnerable plupload, calling a JavaScript function to trigger the installation.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the plupload's Flash component (`plupload.flash.swf`) where the `_init` and `_fireEvent` functions allow for manipulation of the `target` GET parameter to execute arbitrary JavaScript.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Same-Origin Method Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install malicious plugins, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the target WordPress site. This vulnerability can also be used as part of a social engineering attack.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack involves a multi-step process:\n\n1.  A new window with `target='_blank'` is opened to a proxy page.\n2.  The original window is redirected to a vulnerable WordPress plugin installation page.\n3.  The proxy page redirects to the vulnerable plupload component, passing JavaScript function as the `target` parameter.\n\nThis sequence exploits the Same-Origin policy by executing JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable domain from the proxy page.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that redirects to a vulnerable version of WordPress, and to host the proxy page. No authentication or admin privileges are necessary for the initial exploit."
