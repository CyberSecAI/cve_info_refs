Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3634:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `SlideshowPluginSlideshowStylesheet::loadStylesheetByAJAX` function of the Slideshow WordPress plugin. This function, accessible via AJAX requests without authentication, was designed to load stylesheets. However, it was possible to specify an arbitrary option name instead of an actual stylesheet name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin directly used user-provided input (`$styleName`) to fetch WordPress options without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Option Value Disclosure:** The `get_option()` function in WordPress is used to retrieve values associated with different settings. By manipulating the `$styleName` parameter, an attacker could force the plugin to disclose the values of any WordPress option, not just those related to the plugin.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable function was accessible to unauthenticated users via an AJAX action, which meant that an attacker did not need to have any user account on the WordPress instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could extract sensitive information stored in WordPress options. This could include:
    *   Database credentials
    *   API keys
    *   Secret keys
    *   Email addresses
    *   Plugin and theme settings
    *   User information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious AJAX request to the `admin-ajax.php` file, specifically targeting the `SlideshowPluginSlideshowStylesheet::loadStylesheetByAJAX` function.
*   **`styleName` Parameter Exploitation:** The attacker would manipulate the `styleName` parameter within the AJAX request, setting it to the name of a WordPress option they wish to retrieve.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No User Account Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress website (the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint).
*   **Knowledge of WordPress:** The attacker should have some knowledge of the structure of WordPress option names to successfully extract information of value.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.22 of the Slideshow plugin, where the loading mechanism for stylesheets was changed.
* The vulnerable code is present in `classes/SlideshowPluginSlideshowStylesheet.php`, and the fix involved sanitizing and validating the `$styleName` input.
* The plugin was closed and is no longer available for download due to the security issue.
