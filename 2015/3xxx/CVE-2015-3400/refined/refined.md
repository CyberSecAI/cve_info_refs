Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how ZFS on Linux (ZoL) handles NFS share options, specifically after the introduction of changes to keep options per host separated. The issue arises due to how the `sharenfs` property is parsed and applied, leading to incorrect permission configurations. When built with specific patches (related to a pull request #2790), the sharenfs functionality incorrectly applies read access to all hosts regardless of the specified restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect NFS Option Parsing:** The code does not correctly handle the parsing of `sharenfs` options, especially when specifying different access permissions (e.g., read-only, read-write) for different hosts.
-   **Default Access Override:** The "default" options for NFS sharing were incorrectly added, resulting in a default read access being granted to everyone, overriding specified host restrictions.
-   **Inconsistent Application of Options:** The share options are not consistently applied, leading to a situation where access permissions for individual hosts are ignored, and everyone gets at least read access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, even without being on the specified permitted hosts, can gain read access to the shared ZFS datasets, leading to potential data disclosure.
-   **Circumvention of Intended Security:**  The vulnerability undermines the intended access control of the `sharenfs` feature, making it impossible to restrict access to specific hosts as desired.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the machine hosting the ZFS dataset.
-   **NFS Client:** The attacker needs to be able to mount the NFS share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the network, accessible to the vulnerable server.
-   **NFS Client Capabilities:**  The attacker must be able to mount an NFS share (typically, this is a standard functionality in operating systems with network capabilities)

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was introduced in ZFS on Linux version 0.6.4 when built with certain patches.
-   The issue was tracked as issue #3319 on the zfsonlinux/zfs GitHub repository.
-   The incorrect behavior is related to a rewrite of `nfs.c` to keep options per host separated, as part of pull request #2790.
-   The vulnerability results in all hosts having at least read access, even when explicitly configured to restrict access to specific hosts.

In summary, CVE-2015-3400 describes a flaw in ZFS on Linux's NFS sharing implementation, specifically related to the parsing of `sharenfs` options, which results in unintended and overly permissive access to shared datasets.
