- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path validation issue existed in dyld.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path validation, leading to potential code execution by using a manipulated path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by local users through a crafted path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user on the system.
