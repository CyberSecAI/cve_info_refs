- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the Monitor Control Command Set kernel extension by which a userland process could control the value of a function pointer within the kernel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A userland process was able to control a function pointer within the kernel, which is a memory corruption issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application running in userland can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application locally.
