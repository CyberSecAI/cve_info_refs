| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-05 13:44:09 UTC  ``` It was reported that sosreport creates output files with world-readable permissions:  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 7331624 May 4 08:55 sosreport-localhost.localdomain-20150504084328.tar.xz -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 33 May 4 08:55 sosreport-localhost.localdomain-20150504084328.tar.xz.md5  The archive may consists of files originally only accessible by the root user. However, after extracting the archive, all of the files are readable by regular users with access to /var/tmp/.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Grant Murphy for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-05 13:45:04 UTC  ```  Created sos tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1218659](show_bug.cgi?id=1218659 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-3171 sos: sosreport: temporary file created with world-readable permissions [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c2)  Bryn M. Reeves    2015-05-05 15:13:30 UTC  ``` Version & release numbers?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c3)  Bryn M.

Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:   /var/tmp/sosreport-localhost.localdomain-20150505162121.tar.xz  The checksum is: 640904285a51114c0b03f142e533af4c  Please send this file to your support representative.

Reeves <bmr> Date:   Thu Oct 30 16:46:01 2014 +0000      [sosreport] fix archive permissions regression          Restore the umask save/restore around archive creation and ensure     the effective umask is 077 at the time of archive creation.          Fixes #425.          Signed-off-by: Bryn M. Reeves <bmr>  I'll update this in F21, 22 and rawhide to a version that includes the above commit.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-06-01 09:21:39 UTC  ``` This flaw is a regression in the default behaviour of sosreport, which was introduced by the following commit:  <https://github.com/sosreport/sos/commit/8d2577786cce6fcc915836108e405dbf5025dec8>  and was fixed via the following commit:  <https://github.com/sosreport/sos/commit/d7759d3ddae5fe99a340c88a1d370d65cfa73fd6>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1218658#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-06-01 09:24:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue does not affect the version of sos package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.   ``` |  |
