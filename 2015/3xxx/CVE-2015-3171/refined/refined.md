Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `sosreport` tool, when creating archive files, was not correctly setting file permissions. Specifically, it was creating temporary archive files with world-readable permissions ( `-rw-r--r--` ) instead of more restrictive permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from a regression where `sosreport` failed to properly restore and enforce a restrictive umask (077) when creating the archive file. The umask is a permission mask that determines the default permissions of newly created files. This regression caused `sosreport` to create archive files with a default umask of 022 (or something similar), resulting in world-readable permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Since the `sosreport` archive can contain sensitive information from the system (including files normally accessible only by root), this could lead to unauthorized disclosure of information to any user who has access to `/var/tmp/`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Access:** Local users could potentially access sensitive information from the `sosreport` archive that they would not normally have access to. This includes system configuration, logs, and other diagnostic information that could expose the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, the information disclosed could potentially be used in a subsequent attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. Any user with access to the filesystem where the temporary archives are stored (`/var/tmp/`) can potentially access and read the content of the sosreport archive file if it is created with world-readable permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the system that is running the vulnerable `sosreport` tool.
*   The attacker needs to have read access to `/var/tmp` or wherever the `sosreport` archive is saved.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was introduced by the commit https://github.com/sosreport/sos/commit/8d2577786cce6fcc915836108e405dbf5025dec8
*   The issue was fixed by commit https://github.com/sosreport/sos/commit/d7759d3ddae5fe99a340c88a1d370d65cfa73fd6
*   The fix involved restoring the umask saving/restoring mechanism around the archive creation process.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 as they ship with a different version of the sos package.
*   The vulnerability impacted Fedora 21 and later versions due to the version of sosreport used in them.
