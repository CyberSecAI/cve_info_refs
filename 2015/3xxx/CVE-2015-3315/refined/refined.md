Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2015-3315 vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

   - The content directly references CVE-2015-3315 in multiple locations, indicating that the described vulnerabilities are indeed related to this CVE. This is evident in the Red Hat Bugzilla entries (Bug 1211835) and the Exploit Database entry (EDB-ID: 44097).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

   -   The root cause is a combination of **race conditions** and **symlink vulnerabilities** within the Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) related to how it handles crash reports. ABRT, when configured as a crash handler, inadequately sanitizes data from unprivileged processes, creating opportunities for exploitation via race conditions and file path manipulation (symlinks).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

   - **Race Conditions:** ABRT is susceptible to race conditions, such as file system races when writing crash reports, where a user can modify a file after the copy operation but before the chown. This is exemplified in the `abrt-hook-ccpp.c` code snippet.
   - **Symlink Vulnerabilities:** ABRT trusts and follows symlinks in locations like `/tmp` and `/proc/[pid]/exe` without adequate validation, which can allow attackers to direct the tool to arbitrary locations. Specifically:
    -  ABRT trusts symlinks like `/tmp/jvm-%lu/hs_error.log` and opens files without validation.
    - ABRT trusts the `/proc/pid/exe` symlink, even if itâ€™s redirected to an attacker-controlled path.
    - ABRT copies files from attacker-controlled locations by trusting symlinks in `chroot_dir`.
    -  Librpm is instructed to trust an unprivileged root symlink.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

   - **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. The Metasploit module, `abrt_raceabrt_priv_esc.rb`, provides a practical example of exploiting the race condition to take ownership of `/etc/passwd` and add a new root user.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Incorrect handling of symlinks and file permissions can cause ABRT to write core dumps, crash analysis, or other data into files or directories owned by other users, leading to information disclosure.
   - **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Deletion:** By exploiting race conditions, attackers can manipulate the ABRT process to overwrite or delete arbitrary files on the system.

**5. Attack Vectors**

   - **Local Access:** The attack vectors are primarily local, requiring an attacker to have local user privileges on the vulnerable system.
   - **Exploiting Kernel's core_pattern:** The kernel's `core_pattern` feature is used to invoke ABRT, setting the stage for the vulnerability to be triggered when an application crashes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

   -  **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a valid local user account on the target system.
   -  **ABRT Configured as Crash Handler:** The system must have ABRT configured to handle core dumps via `kern.core_pattern`.
   -  **Unpatched System:** The system needs to be vulnerable, meaning it lacks patches that specifically address the race conditions and symlink issues detailed in CVE-2015-3315.
   - **Race Condition Timing:**  For race condition exploits, the attacker must be able to successfully time their operations against ABRT's processes.

**7. Additional Details**

   - The `raceabrt.c` exploit (found on Exploit-DB) highlights a race condition where ownership of `/etc/passwd` can be obtained by repeatedly trying to change ownership via a symlink attack in `/var/tmp/abrt/*/maps`.
   - The `abrt_raceabrt_priv_esc.rb` Metasploit module was tested on specific ABRT versions on Fedora 19 and 20. However, it mentions that Fedora 21 and Red Hat 7 systems are reportedly affected.
    -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is mentioned as having a *moderate* impact, where privilege escalation would be to the `abrt` user rather than to root directly.

   - Upstream commits for the issues are available on GitHub, showing the developers' fixes
    - Fixing the file system race by adding O_EXCL flag
   - The Red Hat Bugzilla entries show that the issues have been addressed in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions with associated errata (RHSA-2015:1083 and RHSA-2015:1210).
   - One of the mitigation steps recommended is to disable ABRT temporarily using the command `sysctl -w kern.core_pattern=core` which prevents the exploitation.
   - There is a discussion in the bugzilla about `abrt-action-install-debuginfo` and how it needs to have environment filtering to avoid privilege escalations.
   - It is also revealed that due to a regression in RHEL 6.5, ABRT does not work for non-root users.

In summary, CVE-2015-3315 involves several race conditions and symlink vulnerabilities in ABRT that can be exploited by a local attacker to gain root privileges, disclose information, and potentially overwrite arbitrary files.
