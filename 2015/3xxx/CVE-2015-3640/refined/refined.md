Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete attempt to sanitize user-provided input within the phpMyBackupPro application. Specifically, the code tries to identify and block characters that might be special to PHP or a shell environment but fails to block all such characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the insufficient filtering of user-controlled input. While some characters (like ';') were blocked in version 2.5, other equally dangerous ones (like '.') were not. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting unsanitized characters, an attacker can manipulate the application into executing arbitrary PHP code or potentially shell commands. This could lead to full compromise of the server hosting the vulnerable application, including data theft, modification or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector involves user-provided input that is not adequately sanitized by the application before being used in PHP file processing. The user is expected to provide an integer value but is able to inject arbitrary PHP code instead.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web interface of the phpMyBackupPro application and provide input through the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Knowledge of Unsanitized Characters:** The attacker needs knowledge of the characters that can bypass the sanitation mechanisms in place. Specifically characters that are special in PHP or shell contexts, such as the period '.' character.
*   **Vulnerability knowledge:** Attacker needs to know that input sanitization is not complete, specifically the period '.' character.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content specifies that this issue was present in version 2.5 of phpMyBackupPro.
*   This issue is related to another similar issue where the code tries to include user input inside a string literal incorrectly, which is described in CVE-2015-3639. The difference is in the approach used for sanitation.
*   The discussion also references a potential duplicate vulnerability (CVE-2009-4050) related to path traversal using "../" sequences which has been improperly fixed in version 2.5.
