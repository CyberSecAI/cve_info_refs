The provided content relates to CVE-2015-3612.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FortiManager versions 5.2.1 and earlier, and 5.0.10 and earlier. The specific root causes for each vulnerability (Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Query Execution, SQL Injection, and Arbitrary File Download) are not detailed in this document, but they stem from insecure handling of input and/or data within the FortiManager application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Escalation of Privileges
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Query Execution
- SQL Injection
- Arbitrary File Download

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Gain elevated privileges within the system.
- Execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser (XSS).
- Execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- Inject malicious SQL code leading to data breaches or manipulation.
- Download arbitrary files from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vectors are not detailed in this document, however, they would likely involve:
- Sending crafted HTTP requests to the FortiManager interface.
- Manipulating input fields to inject malicious scripts or SQL code.
- Exploiting weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need network access to the vulnerable FortiManager instance.
- Technical skills to craft exploits for the vulnerabilities.
