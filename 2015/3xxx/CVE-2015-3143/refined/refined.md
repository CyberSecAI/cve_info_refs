  "CVE-2015-3143": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2015-3143",
      "Description": "cURL and libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.41.0 does not properly re-use NTLM connections, which allows remote attackers to connect as other users via an unauthenticated request, a similar issue to CVE-2014-0015."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the improper re-use of NTLM authenticated connections in curl and libcurl. When an application establishes an NTLM-authenticated connection to a server and sends subsequent requests to the same server without specifying credentials, the existing NTLM connection can be reused, potentially sending unauthenticated requests as if they were from the authenticated user.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper re-use of authenticated connections.",
        "Incorrect handling of connection authentication state."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can potentially connect to a server using an existing NTLM authenticated connection, appearing as another (already authenticated) user.",
      "Attack vector": "The attack vector is remote, exploiting the vulnerability through a network connection.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make a connection to a server using the vulnerable curl library and potentially influence or control the requests sent via that library. They do not need a username or password since they are exploiting existing authenticated connections."
