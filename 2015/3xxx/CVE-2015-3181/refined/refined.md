Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3181:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a deprecated function in Moodle's Web Services that did not respect the `moodle/user:manageownfiles` capability. Even when this capability was revoked for a user, they could still upload private files through the vulnerable Web Services function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Inadequate capability check:** The core issue is that the deprecated Web Services function bypassed the intended access control mechanism. This allowed users to perform actions they should have been restricted from based on their assigned capabilities.
- **Use of deprecated functionality:** The usage of the deprecated function itself may indicate a code maintenance or security debt that contributed to the flaw.
- **Web Services security bypass:** The Web Services layer was not properly enforcing the user's file management capability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Users with revoked `moodle/user:manageownfiles` capability could still upload private files using web services. This could lead to unauthorized data storage and potential information leakage.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through Moodle's Web Services. An attacker would need to use the deprecated API function to upload private files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker would need a valid Moodle user account on the affected system.
- The user account must have the `moodle/user:manageownfiles` capability revoked.
- They must be able to utilize the web services interface to access the deprecated function.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is considered "minor" severity.
- Affected Moodle versions included 2.8 to 2.8.5, 2.7 to 2.7.7, 2.6 to 2.6.10, and earlier unsupported versions.
- The issue was fixed in versions 2.9, 2.8.6, 2.7.8, and 2.6.11.
- The Moodle tracker issue associated with this CVE is MDL-49994.
