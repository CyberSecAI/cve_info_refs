CVE-2015-3296:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient XSS protection in NodeBB before commit ab7f2684750882f7baefbfa31db8d5aac71e6ec3.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NodeBB versions before the fix lacked adequate protection against both javascript: and data: XSS attacks. The application did not sanitize or prevent the use of these schemes in URLs within forum posts.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious links within forum posts and threads, leading to the execution of attacker-defined JavaScript when clicked. This could result in account compromise, information theft, or other malicious activities.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker could craft a forum post or thread containing a malicious link with a javascript: or data: URL. When a user clicks on the link, the injected JavaScript would execute.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to create forum posts or threads in a NodeBB instance that is vulnerable.
