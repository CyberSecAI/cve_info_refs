{
  "CVE-2015-3331": {
    "Description": "The __driver_rfc4106_decrypt function in arch/x86/crypto/aesni-intel_glue.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19.3 does not properly determine the memory locations used for encrypted data, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering a crypto API call, as demonstrated by use of a libkcapi test program with an AF_ALG(aead) socket.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect memory location calculation during AES-NI optimized RFC4106 GCM mode decryption in the Linux Kernel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Memory Management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (system crash), potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers via a connection with an active AES-GCM mode IPSec security association, or local users via a crypto API call with a specific AF_ALG socket.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to send crafted network packets or make a local crypto API call."
