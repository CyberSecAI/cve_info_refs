| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1288317#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-12-04 03:45:34 UTC  ``` The following was reported by OpenSSL upstream:   There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.  This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 13 2015 by Hanno Böck. The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1288317#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-12-04 04:21:55 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1288317#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-12-04 04:23:14 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  OpenSSL 1.0.2: <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=d73cc256c8e256c32ed959456101b73ba9842f72>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1288317#c3)  Fedora Update System    2015-12-06 19:19:03 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.2e-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1288317#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-12-07 06:12:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of OpenSSL as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.   ``` |  |

### The Fuzzing Project

![american fuzzy lop](afl500.png)

Fuzzing is a powerful strategy to find bugs in software. The idea
is quite simple: Generate a large number of randomly malformed inputs
for a software to parse and see what happens. If the program crashes then
something is likely wrong.
While fuzzing is a well-known strategy, it is surprisingly easy
to find bugs, often with security implications, in widely used software.

Memory access errors are the errors most likely to be exposed when fuzzing software that is written in C/C++.
While they differ in the details (stack overflow,
heap overflow, use after free, ...), the core problem is often the same:
A software reads or writes to wrong memory locations.

A modern Linux or BSD system ships a large number of basic tools that
do some kind of file displaying and parsing.
In their current state most of these tools are not suitable for
untrusted inputs.

On the other hand we have powerful tools these days that allow us
to find and analyze these bugs, notably the fuzzing tool
american fuzzy lop
and the Address Sanitizer feature of gcc and clang.

The Fuzzing Project is trying to improve the state of things. I
maintain
some helpful pointers how you can join the effort to improve
the state of security in free software.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

## [When your Memory Allocator hides Security Bugs](/65-When-your-Memory-Allocator-hides-Security-Bugs.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, January 30. 2019

![Memory](/uploads/ram.jpg)Recently I shared some information about potential [memory safety bugs in the Apache web server together with Craig Young](https://github.com/hannob/apache-uaf). One issue that came up in that context is the so-called pool allocator Apache is using.

What is this [pool allocator](https://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/1.6/group__apr__pools.html)? Apache’s APR library has a feature where you can allocate a pool, which is a larger area of memory, and then do memory allocations within that pool. It’s essentially a separate memory allocation functionality by the library. Similar concepts exist in other software.

Why would anyone do that? It might bring performance benefits to have memory allocation that’s optimized for a specific application. It also can make programming more convenient when you can allocate many small buffers in a pool and then not bothering about freeing each one of then and instead just free the whole pool with all allocations within.

There’s a disadvantage with the pool allocator, and that is that it may hide bugs. Let’s look at a simple code example:

#include <apr\_pools.h>

#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h>

int main() {

apr\_pool\_t \*p;

char \*b1, \*b2;

apr\_initialize();

apr\_pool\_create(&p, NULL);

b1 = apr\_palloc(p, 6);

b2 = apr\_palloc(p, 6);

strcpy(b1, "This is too long");

strcpy(b2, "Short");

printf("%s %s\n", b1, b2);

}

We can compile this with:

`gcc $(pkg-config --cflags --libs apr-1) input.c`

What we’re doing here is that we create a pool p and we create two buffers (b1, b2) within that pool, each six byte. Now we fill those buffers with strings. However for b1 we fill it with a string that is larger than its size. This is thus a classic buffer overflow. The `printf` at the end which outputs both strings will show garbled output, because the two buffers interfere.

Now the question is how do we find such bugs? Of course we can carefully analyze the code, and in the simple example above this is easy to do. But in complex software such bugs are hard to find manually, therefore there are tools to detect unsafe memory access (e.g. buffer overflows, use after free) during execution. The state of the art tool is Address Sanitizer (ASAN). If you write C code and don’t use it for testing yet, you should start doing so now.

Address Sanitizer is part of both the gcc and clang compiler and it can be enabled by passing `-fsanitize=address` on the command line. We’ll also add -g, which adds debugging information and will give us better error messages. So let’s try:

`gcc -g -fsanitize=address $(pkg-config --cflags --libs apr-1) input.c`

If you try this you will find out that nothing has changed. We still see the garbled string and Address Sanitizer has not detected the buffer overflow.

Let’s try rewriting the above code in plain C without the pool allocator:

#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

char \*b1, \*b2;

b1 = malloc(6);

b2 = malloc(6);

strcpy(b1, "This is too long");

strcpy(b2, "Short");

printf("%s %s\n", b1, b2);

}

If we compile and run this with ASAN it will give us a nice error message that tells us what’s going on:

==9319==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000016 at pc 0x7f81fdd08c9d bp 0x7ffe82881930 sp 0x7ffe828810d8

#2 0x7f81fdb204ea in \_\_libc\_start\_main (/lib64/libc.so.6+0x244ea)

So why didn’t the error show up when we used the pool allocator? The reason is that ASAN is built on top of the normal C memory allocation functions like `malloc`/`free`. It does not know anything about APR’s pools. From ASAN’s point of view the pool is just one large block of memory, and what’s happening inside is not relevant.

Thus we have a buffer overflow, but the state of the art tool to detect buffer overflows is unable to detect it. This is obviously not good, it means the pool allocator takes one of the most effective ways to discover an important class of security bugs away from us.

If you’re looking for solutions for that problem you may [find old documentation about "Debugging Memory Allocation in APR"](http://download.vikis.lt/manual/developer/debugging.html). However it relies on flags that have been removed from the APR library, so it’s not helpful. However there’s a not very well documented option of the APR library that allows us to gain memory safety checks back. Passing `--enable-pool-debug=yes` to the configure script will effectively disable the pool allocator and create a separate memory allocation for each call to the pool allocator.

If we compile our first example again, this time with the pool debugger and ASAN, we’ll see the error:

==20228==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000016 at pc 0x7fe2e625dc9d bp 0x7ffe8419a180 sp 0x7ffe84199928

Apache is not alone in having a custom memory allocation that can hide bugs. Mozilla’s NSPR and NSS libraries have something called an Arena Pool, Glib has memory slices and PHP has the Zend allocator. All of them have the potential of hiding memory safety bugs from ASAN, yet luckily all have an option to be turned off for testing. I maintain [a collection of information about such custom allocators and how to disable them](https://fuzzing-project.org/tutorial-malloc.html).

But back to Apache. When we started reporting use after free bugs we saw with the debugging option for the pool allocator we learned from the Apache developers that there are incompatibilities with the http2 module and the pool debugger. This has led to replies after our disclosure that these [are non-issues](https://icing.github.io/mod_h2/pool-debugging.html), because nobody should run the pool debugger in production.

It should be noted that we were also able to reproduce some bugs without the pool debugger in the latest Apache version (we have shared this information with Apache and will share it publicly later), and that indeed it seems some people did run the pool debugger in production (OpenBSD).

But I have another problem with this. If we consider that parts of the current Apache code are incompatible with the APR pool debugger then we end up with an unfortunate situation: If a tool like ASAN reports memory safety bugs with the pool debugger we don’t know if they are real issues or just incompatibilities. If we turn off the pool debugger we won’t see most of the memory safety bugs.

That’s a situation where testing Apache for memory safety bugs becomes practically very difficult. In my opinion that by itself is a worrying and severe security issue.

## [Stack buffer overflow in WolfSSL before 3.13.0](/63-Stack-buffer-overflow-in-WolfSSL-before-3.13.0.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Saturday, March 24. 2018

During some tests of TLS libraries I found a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the WolfSSL library.

Finding this one was surprisingly simple: I had a wolfssl server that was compiled with address sanitizer and ran the SSL Labs test against it.

The bug happens in the parsing of the signature hash algorithm list that is sent in a ClientHello and is basically a textbook stack buffer overflow. WolfSSL simply tries to store that in an array with 32 elements. If one sends more than 32 hash algorithms it overflows.

With the SSL Labs scan the bug only causes WolfSSL to terminate if it's compiled with address sanitizer, but if one sends a very large list of hash algorithms it also crashes in a normal compile. In situations where WolfSSL is used without ASLR this bug is probably trivially exploitable.

I have created a simple [bash proof of concept](https://github.com/hannob/wolfoverflow) (using netcat and xxd) that crashes a WolfSSL server.

The bug was fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/1231/commits/9f7e40ad5c8097ff38d7caff4a9989db260981cc) and in version 3.13.0 of WolfSSL.

## [How Optionsbleed wasn't found in 2014](/61-How-Optionsbleed-wasnt-found-in-2014.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, September 20. 2017

Shortly after I [published details about the Optionsbleed bug](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html) I learned about something quite surprising: Others had already discovered this bug before, but have neither pinned it down to Apache nor recognized that it is a security vulnerability.

A paper published in 2014 on Arxiv titled ["Support for Various HTTP Methods on the Web"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2330.pdf) mentions servers sending malformed Allow headers. It has examples listed that very clearly look like the output you get from a server vulnerable to Optionsbleed.

This alone would be noteworthy enough, but there's something that makes this even more surprising. This paper was published in May 2014, about a month after the Heartbleed bug was found. Heartbleed gained a lot of attention, not just in the tech scene, it was widely covered in the mainstream media. It can be assumed that almost everyone working in IT had heard of it.

So we have a situation where a major bug hit the news - and several people must have had evidence of a very similar bug in front of their eyes shortly afterwards. Yet nobody has recognized it as such. One of the authors [mentioned in a comment](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html#c989) that they hadn't looked at it from a security perspective, but still you'd think that someone should have noticed.

While it's always problematic to interpret too much into single anecdotes, it still makes me wonder things. Are we just terribly bad at explaining security issues? My personal impression is that Heartbleed is actually an issue that is relatively simple to grasp (of course best explained by [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1354/)). Going from there to the idea that seeing random garbage in HTTP headers indicates a very similar bug doesn't seem so far fetched to me. But the facts seem to disprove that.

## [Six year old PDF loop bug affects most major implementations](/59-Six-year-old-PDF-loop-bug-affects-most-major-implementations.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Sunday, September 3. 2017

![Endless Loop](/uploads/moebius-endless-loop.jpg)I recently did some testing of the qpdf library with afl and libfuzzer. I discovered an input sample that would generate a high CPU load spike and eventually after several minutes cause an out of memory error. It looked like the parser was caught in some kind of endless loop.

This reminded me of something. In [2011 at the Chaos Communication Camp Andreas Bogk gave a talk about creating a formally verified PDF parser with Ocaml and Coq](https://media.ccc.de/v/cccamp11-4426-certified_programming_with_dependent_types-en). In that talk he mentioned that one could create a PDF file with cross-referencing xref tables. A naive parser would get caught in an endless loop. He showed that the evince thumbnailer process was affected by this.

This was eventually fixed in evince's underlying rendering library poppler. But it seems this issue hasn't reached many other PDF parser libraries. The qpdf issue I had seen was exactly the [same bug](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/149). The sample file can [be found here](https://github.com/andreas23/pdfparser/blob/master/tests/loop_edited.pdf). If you follow that link you'll immediately notice that Github's Javascript PDF viewer is also affected.

How about Mozilla Firefox? [Affected](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393476). (They use pdf.js, which is the same code Github uses.) What about Chrome / Chromium, which uses a library called PDFium? [Affected](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/pdfium/issues/detail?id=875). (Notably they already had a test PDF for this, but the function that causes the loop wasn't tested.) Microsoft Edge? [Affected](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/13534806/). Ghostscript, which is the other major PDF parser used by many free and open source tools? [Also affected](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698409). For completeness, Adobe Reader and Apple's OS X internal PDF viewer were unaffected.

To make this clear: This isn't a major security issue, the impact is a denial of service. But it is certainly something undesirable that should be fixed.

It is remarkable that a bug that was discovered six years ago affected the majority of widely used PDF implementations. But it falls into a pattern of IT security: Very often discovering security issues means rediscovering old issues. In general this is a difficult problem to solve, as it touches complex questions about knowledge transfer.

However in this specific case - an input file that causes a bug in one implementation also causes the same bug in other implementations - there are things that can be done.

I report fuzzing-related bugs on a very regular basis and I always share a sample file that triggers the bug. In the best cases the maintainers of the affected software take the bug triggering sample and use it in their test suite. I think this should be a standard practice.

However that only prevents regressions in the same software. But maintainers of parsers for common file formats could also take a look at their competitors and check their test suites. While the PDF standard probably isn't well defined enough to allow a visual comparison of rendering output, it's surely obvious that no input file should cause a crash, an invalid memory access or an endless loop.

Looking at the common PDF libraries the situation with test cases was quite mixed. Mozilla's pdf.js had the most [extensive collection of files](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/test/pdfs), many of them examples from previous bugs. However one should know that about a third of them are not part of their code repository. They're referenced as links (all of them pointing to their own bug tracker or to the Internet archive, so I guess they're reasonably stable).

PDFium, used by Google Chrome, has a far less extensive test suite with only 96 PDF files. I have reported a bunch of PDFium bugs myself in the past (Examples: [[1]](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=450871), [[2]](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457493), [[3]](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=450971)) and the test cases I provided never got added to the test suite.

QPDF is doing very well: They ship 278 test PDFs and for all the bugs I reported lately they added the provided sample files.

Ghostscript has only three PDF example files in its code (other PDFs in the code seem to be documentation, not test cases). Poppler's code has no PDFs bundled at all. They have a separate [test repository](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/test/) for that with 35 files, but it hasn't been updated since 2009. There's definitely lots of room for improvement in that area.

## [exiv2: multiple memory safety issues](/58-exiv2-multiple-memory-safety-issues.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Monday, July 3. 2017

*This post first appeared on [oss-security](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/30/1).*

I'm reporting three issues here in exiv2, a parser libary for image metadata. These are only examples, exiv2 is full of memory safety bugs that can trivially be found by running afl with asan for a few hours.

I have not reported those issues upstream. When I previously tried to report bugs in exiv2 found via fuzzing the upstream author made it clear to me that he has little interest in fixing those issues and doesn't consider his software suitable to parse defect files (which basically means it's unsuitable for untrusted input). The [discussion can be read here](http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1248). (the page is sometimes not available, searching for it in the google cache usually works though)

exiv2 is to my knowledge used by the major Linux Desktops GNOME and KDE. I'll also inform their security teams. I leave it up to Linux distros how to handle this, but it certainly is problematic that a crucial parser used by major desktop applications is not interested in fixing potential security issues.

## [Diving into Control Flow Integrity](/57-Diving-into-Control-Flow-Integrity.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, March 31. 2017

To improve security, modern systems contain many mitigation strategies that try to make it harder to exploit security vulnerabilities. Commonly used strategies include stack canaries, address space layout randomization (ASLR) and nonexecutable memory pages. Unfortunately the Linux distributions have been slow in adopting ASLR, but this is finally changing.

A new set of mitigation technologies has been discussed for a while under the umbrella term "Control Flow Integrity" (CFI). I won't get into technical details, but the very general idea is to add additional checks to the code that prohibit jumps to code parts that are not supposed to happen in the normal operation of a software.

LLVM's Clang compiler supports a form of CFI since version 3.7. Other forms of CFI are available under windows in Visual Studio ([CFGuard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt637065%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)) and with Grsecurity ([RAP](https://grsecurity.net/rap_announce.php)).

Recently I experimented a bit with the Clang version of CFI. It's been one of those situations where you dig into a topic and find out that it's really hard to Google for advice. The information out there is relatively limited: There's the [official LLVM documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html), a [talk by Kostya Serebryany that briefly mentions CFI in the second half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTkYDA0En6U) and [two](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/10/17/lets-talk-about-cfi-clang-edition/) [blog](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2017/02/20/the-challenges-of-deploying-security-mitigations/) posts by the company Trail of Bits. Also [Chrome is using a subset of the CFI functionality and there's a list of bugs found with it](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity).

Given the relatively scarce information when starting to use it you will experience situations where things fail and you won't find any help via Google.

So why would you want to use CFI? One possibility would be to create a super-hardened Linux system where, beyond using the "old" exploit mitigations like ASLR, one would also enable CFI. The computational costs of doing so are relatively small (Kostya Serebryany mentions in the talk above that they were unable to measure the CPU cost in Chrome). The executables grow in size and likely use more memory, but not in extraordinary amounts (below 10 percent). So from a performance side this is doable.

I started by compiling some small applications with CFI to see what happens. In some cases they "just work". In most cases I ended up having strange linker errors that were nontrivial to debug. Interesting for Linux distributions: There seems to be no dependency chain that needs to be considered (which is different from many of Clang's Sanitizer features). It's possible to have an executable built with CFI that depends on libraries not using CFI and it's also possible to have libraries using CFI that are used by executables not using CFI. This is good: If we'd strive for our super-hardened Linux we can easily exclude packages that create too many problems or start by including packages where we think they'd profit most from such extra protection.

CFI itself is enabled with the flag *-fsanitize=cfi*. It needs two other compiler and linker flags to work: *-fvisibility=hidden* for the compiler, which hides unnecessary symbols, and *-flto* for the linker to enable Link Time Optimization. The latter one needs the Gold linker, depending on your system you may need to install the LLVM gold plugin. If Gold isn't your default linker you can pass *-fuse-ld=gold*. Furthermore if you want to debug things you want to add *-fno-sanitize-trap=all* and enable extended debugging with *-g*, this will give you useful error messages in case CFI stops your application. (However you probably don't want to do that in production systems, as the error reporting can introduce additional bugs.)

In theory some of these flags only need to be passed to the compiler and others to the linker, but compilation systems aren't always strict in separating those, so we just add all of them to both.

So we can start compiling the current version of curl (7.53.1):
```
./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ LD=clang CFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto"

make
```

However we'll end up getting an error when it tries to link to the shared library. I guess it's a libtool problem, but I haven't digged into it. For now we can just disable the shared library by adding *--disable-shared*:
```
./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ LD=clang CFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=cfi -fvisibility=hidden -fuse-ld=gold -flto" --disable-shared
make
```

## [htpasswDoS: Local Denial of Service via Apache httpd password hashes](/56-htpasswDoS-Local-Denial-of-Service-via-Apache-httpd-password-hashes.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Tuesday, January 10. 2017

![Apache logo](/uploads/apache-httpd-logo.png)The way the Apache httpd web server handles password hashes can be abused by a malicious user on a server to cause resource exhaustion and denial of service of the web server. I reported this a while ago to the Apache security team - which led to a lengthy discussion where I was a bit appalled about some of the statements I got from the Apache developers. They can be summed up in a way that major use cases of Apache - especially in web hosting environments - are not recommended by their developers.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/18d199e9596c4bdb82d4b86de95bc498)

## [Fuzzing Irssi with Perl Scripts](/55-Fuzzing-Irssi-with-Perl-Scripts.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, January 6. 2017

When using fuzzing tools like afl a common challenge is how you can pass input to the interesting parts of the application you want to fuzz. In easy situations we have a tool that will accept our input as a file or via stdin. However sometimes this is not easily possible.

Let's have a look at Irssi, an irc chat client. The only input you can pass on the command line is a config file. Fuzzing Irssi 0.8.10 easily led to [a segfault caused by a null pointer access](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/550). However while bugs in config file parsers probably still should be fixed, usually they are not very interesting. (There [can be exceptions](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/8-Why-it-can-make-sense-to-fuzz-config-files-two-out-of-bounds-vulnerabilities-in-curl-TFPA-0042015.html).)

So what else might be interesting? Irssi does some parsing on all output, e.g. due to [color codes](https://irssi.org/documentation/settings/#a_d). However we can't just print text that is passed via the command line as an input file. We have to abuse Irssi's perl scripting capability for that.

We can place a [simple perl script](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-print.pl) that will read a file (`fuzzp.txt`) and print it into Irssi's autorun directory (default location is ~/.Irssi/scripts/autorun/). We can then place some [examples of Irssi color codes](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/irssi-example-colorcodes.txt) into the directory "in/". I have installed an afl/asan-instrumented Irssi into my system to `/usr/local/`, because for running perl scripts it needs more than just the executable. So we can run afl like this:

`afl-fuzz -i in -o out -m none -f fuzzp.txt Irssi`

afl will put the fuzzed output into `fuzzp.txt` and our autoload script will read it from there. Doing this lets us learn that the sequence "%[" causes Irssi to read an invalid memory byte. For reasons unclear to me this only happens if a script outputs this sequence, not if a user types it in. (This issue got [CVE-2017-5196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5196) assigned.)

We can go further and do a [similar script that executes input as a command](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-command.pl). Commands are things like "/QUIT" that control the application and the channel behavior. I named the input file `fuzzc.txt`, so we can place some [simple Irssi commands](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-command.pl) into `in/` and run:

`afl-fuzz -i in -o out -m none -f fuzzc.txt Irssi`

Thus we will now fuzz Irssi's command processing.

As we have seen, scripting functionality can be used to fuzz an application. So if you want to fuzz something and don't know how to pass input: See if there's a scripting functionality.

*Irssi has issued a [security advisory for several security vulnerabilities](https://irssi.org/security/irssi_sa_2017_01.txt), including the out of bounds read mentioned above. All vulnerabilities and the config file parser segfault are fixed in 0.8.21 and 1.0.0.*

## [Update on MatrixSSL miscalculation (CVE-2016-8671, incomplete fix for CVE-2016-6887)](/54-Update-on-MatrixSSL-miscalculation-CVE-2016-8671%2C-incomplete-fix-for-CVE-2016-6887.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Saturday, October 15. 2016

I recently reported how I found [various bugs in the bignum implementation of MatrixSSL](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/51-Fun-with-Bignums-Crashing-MatrixSSL-and-more.html), some of them leading to remotely exploitable vulnerabilities.

One of the bugs was that the modular exponentiation function - pstm\_exptmod() - produced wrong results for some inputs . This wasn't really fixed, but only worked around by restricting the allowed size of the modulus. Not surprisingly it is still possible to find inputs that cause miscalculations ([code](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/matrixssl-exptmod-bug-variant2.c)). I reported this to MatrixSSL on August 1st.

Recently MatrixSSL released another update (3.8.6) [fixing several vulnerabilities reported by Craig Young from Tripwire](http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/flawed-matrixssl-code-highlights-need-for-better-iot-update-practices/). However the pstm\_exptmod() bug is still there. (The incomplete fix got assigned [CVE-2016-8671](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8671).)

It is unclear how exploitable such bugs are, but given that it's used in the context of cryptographic functions handling secret key material this is clearly a reason for concern.

MatrixSSL has long advertised itself as a safer alternative to OpenSSL, because it didn't suffer from the same kind of high severity bugs. I think it has been sufficiently shown that this was due to the fact that nobody was looking. But what's more worrying is that bugs they knew about for several months now don't get fixed properly.

## [Out of bounds heap bugs in glib, heap buffer overflow in gnome-session](/53-Out-of-bounds-heap-bugs-in-glib%2C-heap-buffer-overflow-in-gnome-session.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, September 16. 2016

By testing GNOME-related packages with Address Sanitizer I recently discovered several trivial to find bugs.

Two out of bounds bugs in the glib library were uncovered by running the test suite with Address Sanitizer enabled. One heap buffer overflow in the parameter parsing of gnome-session was uncovered by trying to start GNOME. Given that these bugs weren't discovered earlier means that most likely nobody ever used Address Sanitizer to test GNOME components.

I strongly recommend to GNOME and to other software communities to use Address Sanitizer testing in order to improve the quality of their software.

## [Multiple vulnerabilities in RPM – and a rant](/52-Multiple-vulnerabilities-in-RPM-and-a-rant.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, August 26. 2016

Last year in November I decided that it might be a good idea to fuzz the parsers of package management tools in Linux distributions. I quickly found a couple of issues in DPKG and RPM. For DPKG the process went very smooth. I reported them to Debian's security team, eight days later fixes and security advisories were published by both Debian and Ubuntu, the main distributions using DPKG. For RPM the process was a bit more difficult.

If you want to report a bug to RPM you first may wonder where to report it. The RPM webpage [1] is a trac installation which has its own bug tracker. However if you try to register an account there you'll get forwarded to an HTTPS site with an expired certificate that doesn't match the domain name. In case you are brave and tell your browser to ignore all warnings you'll be greeted by a broken-looking trac without any CSS. Should you proceed and create an account you will learn that this doesn't help you, because in order to be allowed to report a bug you first have to ask on the mailing list or in the IRC channel for permission [2]. That's probably the point where many well-meaning bug reporters give up.

Okay, but RPM originally stood for “Red Hat package manager” (I've been told that today it stands for RPM Package Manager), so maybe Red Hat feels responsible. So I reported three bugs with sample files triggering them to the Red Hat security team on November 20th. The answer was – to put it mildly – a bit dissatisfying. I'll just fully quote it: “Thanks for the report. We also received about 30+ crash reports in RPM from

others) will take quite a bit of time. We simply don't have the resources

to spend hours upon hours analyzing all crash reports.”

Okay, so I wasn't the only one fuzzing RPM and the maybe bugs will be fixed some day. I waited. In the meantime I got contacted by another person who also had tried to report fuzzing bugs in RPM and who has made similar experiences (maybe the same person who reported the 30+ crashers, I don't know).

In February I decided to ask what the state of things is. I also gave them a 30 day period until I'd publish the bugs (I know that it's now long past that, I shouldn't have let this issue wait so long). I ended up having a call with a Red Hat security team member and exchanged a couple of mails. I learned that RPM has a Github repository [3], which contains fixes for some (but not all) of the issues I reported, however that's nowhere referenced on its webpage. I then fuzzed the current RPM git code again and found two more issues I also reported to the Red Hat security team.

Status today is that the latest release of RPM on its webpage – 4.12.0.1 - is from July 2015, so all of the bugs still affect this release. However it seems there is an unofficial 4.13 release that's nowhere to be found on the RPM webpage, but Red Hat is using it together with some fixes [4]. And the Github repository says the latest release is 4.12.0, so according to three different sources three different versions are the current one (4.12.0, 4.12.0.1, 4.13).

One of the bugs – a stack overflow (write) - is still present in the latest code on Github.

**Commend and Conclusion**

This blog post probably reads like a big rant about how unprofessional Red Hat is in handling potential security issues. But this is contrary to my usual experience. I often see Red Hat developers being very active in the free software security community and often contributing in a positive way. Quite simply I expect better from Red Hat. This is not some dubious Enterprise vendor where I wouldn't be the least bit surprised of such a reaction.

The development process of RPM seems to be totally chaotic, it's neither clear where one reports bugs nor where one gets the latest code and security bugs don't get fixed within a reasonable time.

There's been some recent events that make me feel especially worried about this: An unknown person has created an entry in the Libarchive issue tracker [5] that points to an anonymous document [6] with a very detailed description of various security weaknesses in the FreeBSD update process (most of them are still unfixed). The most worrying thing about this is however that the anonymous post mentions the existence similar documents affecting multiple Linux distributions. These documents haven't shown up publicly yet and given the unclear nature of this incident it's hard to know whether they ever will become public or exist at all. But this should still be reason enough to have a closer look at potential security vulnerabilities in all pieces of Linux package management systems.

I haven't analyzed the RPM installation process in detail, so I can't say how likely it is that the RPM tool ever sees a malformed input file. It seems downloads happen over HTTP, but the first thing that happens is a signature check. As the signature is part of the RPM file it already needs to be parsed for this. The exact impact of these bugs would require further analysis. But independent of how likely this is I think the parser in such a crucial piece of software should be robust. It should be safe to use the rpm tool to show info about a file on the command line.

All bugs were found with the help of american fuzzy lop. Here are the bugs:

Stack Overflow in glob() / rpmglob.c.

Sample file (test with rpm -i [input]):

Git commit:

<https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/b722cf86200505b3e3fcbb2095c4ff61f1f5a2ab>

Finally one annoying thing to admit: In my original report I included another segfault in headerVerifyInfo() with unclear reasons. However I am now unable to reproduce this one. It may be due to compiler options, different command line parameters or dependencies on my system that have changed. For completeness I'm still providing the sample file:

<https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/rpm-segfault-headerVerifyInfo.rpm>

(Ideally the RPM developers should include all those sample files in a test suite they regularly run against an address sanitizer build of RPM.)

Please also note that I expect this list to be incomplete and there are likely more issues that could be uncovered with further fuzzing. I'll test that once all the existing issues are fixed.

## [Fun with Bignums: Crashing MatrixSSL and more](/51-Fun-with-Bignums-Crashing-MatrixSSL-and-more.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Sunday, July 31. 2016

If you've been following my fuzzing work you will be aware that I've fuzzed various bignum libraries and found several bugs by comparing implementations against each other.

I recently had a look at the MatrixSSL's modular exponentiation function, for reasons I'll explain later. I wrote [a wrapper, similar to previous experiments, comparing its result to OpenSSL](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/openssl-vs-matrixssl-modexp.c).

I immediately noted that the pstm\_exptmod() function of MatrixSSL has certain limitations that weren't documented. If one tries to calculate a modular exponentiation with the base equal to the modulus (a^b mod a, [code](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/matrixssl-base-equals-modulus.c)) it would return an error. If one tries to calculate a modular exponentiation with the base zero (0^b mod a, [code](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/matrixssl-base-zero.c), [CVE-2016-6885](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6885)) it would crash with an invalid free operation, potentially leading to memory corruption.

In normal cryptographic operations these values should never appear. But these values are in many situations attacker controlled. One situation is during an RSA key exchange. What happens here is that a client encrypts a random secret with the server's key. However a malicious client could simply send a zero or the key's modulus here. I created a [patch against openssl that allows to test this](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/openssl-break-rsa-values.diff). Both values crash the MatrixSSL server. However the crash seems not to happen in pstm\_exptmod(), it hits another bug earlier ([CVE-2016-6886](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6886)). In both cases the crash happens due to an invalid memory read in the function pstm\_reverse(), which is not prepared for zero-sized inputs and will underflow the len variable.

The crashes [have been fixed in 3.8.4](http://www.matrixssl.org/blog/releases/matrixssl_3_8_4), but the pstm\_exptmod() function still doesn't accept these inputs. However it no longer crashes with a zero base. It may be possible that these issues can be triggered through other code paths. I haven't tested Diffie Hellman key exchanges, which also allows putting attacker-controlled values into a modular exponentiation.

This is an interesting class of bugs. Bignum functions often aren't designed to handle all inputs and only consider values that make sense in the context of the cryptographic operations. However if they are attacker-controlled this may lead to problems. I just discovered a [somewhat similar issue in Nettle](https://lists.lysator.liu.se/pipermail/nettle-bugs/2016/003104.html). They switched their RSA implementation from GMP's mpz\_powm() function to mpz\_powm\_sec(), which is supposed to be sidechannel resistant. However mpz\_powm\_sec() is no drop-in replacement. Unlike mpz\_pown() it doesn't accept even moduli and crashes with a floating point error. Therefore when trying to use a specifically crafted RSA key with an even modulus this will crash. Fortunately this was discovered before the change made it into a release.

But back to MatrixSSL: Independent of these corner case values that lead to failures I was able to identify an input value that caused a wrong calculation result ([code](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/matrixssl-exptmod-bug.c),[CVE-2016-6887](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6887).

There's a particularly severe risk with calculation errors in the modulo exponentiation when it comes to the RSA algorithm. A common way to speed up the calculation of RSA signatures is an algorithm based on the chinese remainder theorem (CRT) that splits it up into two smaller calculations. However if one of these calculations goes wrong an attacker can learn the private key. Last year [Florian Weimer observed that various devices had this error](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976703) and he could extract their keys. He recently mentioned on the [oss-security mailing list that he also observed this in devices using MatrixSSL](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/06/27/1).

The way the MatrixSSL team "fixed" the miscalculation issue is not really satisfying: They now restrict the input to the pstm\_exptmod() function to a set of bit sizes (512, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, 4096). My test input had a different bit size, therefore I cannot reproduce the miscalculation any more, but the underlying bug is most likely still there. I've tried to find inputs matching these restrictions and still causing wrong results, but without success yet. Independent of that the restriction means that connections to sites with unusual key sizes or Diffie Hellman moduli will no longer work. While they are not common, there is no rule that RSA keys or Diffie Hellman moduli need to have certain sizes.

Despite the fact that the bug may be still there the CRT attack will probably no longer work. A protection mechanism against that was implemented in version 3.8.3.

I got told by the MatrixSSL developers that their bignum code is based on libtommath. Therefore I also checked if the same bugs appeared there. That wasn't the case. The test input causing wrong results in MatrixSSL were correctly calculated by libtommath and it was also capable of correctly using a zero base or a base equal to the modulus.

## [Use after free in my\_login() function of DBD::mysql (Perl module)](/50-Use-after-free-in-my_login-function-of-DBDmysql-Perl-module.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Monday, July 25. 2016

DBD::mysql versions 4.033 and earlier have a use after free bug in the my\_login() function. DBD::mysql is a Perl module providing bindings to the mysql database. The issue was fixed in version 4.034.

This issue was discovered with Address Sanitizer.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,

cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

OpenSSL Security Advisory [3 Dec 2015] - Updated [4 Dec 2015]
=============================================================
[Updated 4 Dec 2015]: This advisory has been updated to include the details of
CVE-2015-1794, a Low severity issue affecting OpenSSL 1.0.2 which had a fix
included in the released packages but was missed from the advisory text.
NOTE: WE ANTICIPATE THAT 1.0.0t AND 0.9.8zh WILL BE THE LAST RELEASES FOR THE
0.9.8 AND 1.0.0 VERSIONS AND THAT NO MORE SECURITY FIXES WILL BE PROVIDED (AS
PER PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS). USERS ARE ADVISED TO UPGRADE TO LATER VERSIONS.
BN\_mod\_exp may produce incorrect results on x86\_64 (CVE-2015-3193)
==================================================================
Severity: Moderate
There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No
EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA
as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information
about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only
accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by
default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.
This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 13 2015 by Hanno
BÃ¶ck. The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL
development team.
Certificate verify crash with missing PSS parameter (CVE-2015-3194)
===================================================================
Severity: Moderate
The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference
if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and absent
mask generation function parameter. Since these routines are used to verify
certificate signature algorithms this can be used to crash any certificate
verification operation and exploited in a DoS attack. Any application which
performs certificate verification is vulnerable including OpenSSL clients and
servers which enable client authentication.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1q
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 27 2015 by LoÃ¯c Jonas Etienne
(Qnective AG). The fix was developed by Dr. Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
X509\_ATTRIBUTE memory leak (CVE-2015-3195)
==========================================
Severity: Moderate
When presented with a malformed X509\_ATTRIBUTE structure OpenSSL will leak
memory. This structure is used by the PKCS#7 and CMS routines so any
application which reads PKCS#7 or CMS data from untrusted sources is affected.
SSL/TLS is not affected.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1q
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0t
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zh
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on November 9 2015 by Adam Langley
(Google/BoringSSL) using libFuzzer. The fix was developed by Dr. Stephen
Henson of the OpenSSL development team.
Race condition handling PSK identify hint (CVE-2015-3196)
=========================================================
Severity: Low
If PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client then
the values are wrongly updated in the parent SSL\_CTX structure. This can
result in a race condition potentially leading to a double free of the
identify hint data.
This issue was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2d and 1.0.1p but has not been previously
listed in an OpenSSL security advisory. This issue also affects OpenSSL 1.0.0
and has not been previously fixed in an OpenSSL 1.0.0 release.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2d
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1p
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0t
The fix for this issue can be identified in the OpenSSL git repository by commit
ids 3c66a669dfc7 (1.0.2), d6be3124f228 (1.0.1) and 1392c238657e (1.0.0).
The fix was developed by Dr. Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.
Anon DH ServerKeyExchange with 0 p parameter (CVE-2015-1794)
============================================================
Severity: Low
If a client receives a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with
the value of p set to 0 then a seg fault can occur leading to a possible denial
of service attack.
This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2e
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 3 2015 by Guy Leaver (Cisco). The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Note
====
As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
(https://www.openssl.org/about/releasestrat.html), support for OpenSSL versions
1.0.0 and 0.9.8 will cease on 31st December 2015. No security updates for these
versions will be provided after that date. In the absence of significant
security issues being identified prior to that date, the 1.0.0t and 0.9.8zh
releases will be the last for those versions. Users of these versions are
advised to upgrade.

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Thursday, December 3. 2015

Today [OpenSSL released a security advisory](https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt) and updates for a carry propagation bug that I discovered in the BN\_mod\_exp() function. The bug is in the 1.0.2 branch of OpenSSL and is fixed in 1.0.2e. It only affects the x86\_64 assembly optimizations. Other architectures and older versions are not affected.

The bug was introduced in commit [this commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/72a158703bf2b33f4eba6920302941560f7a848d) and fixed in [this one](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/29851264f11ccc70c6c0140d7e3d8d93ef5c9b11). It got [CVE-2015-0860](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0860) assigned. A simple [proof of concept test can be found here](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/CVE-2015-3193-openssl-vs-gcrypt-modexp.c).

**Fuzzing Bignum libraries**

This is not the first time a miscalculation bug was found in the bignum library of OpenSSL. In January OpenSSL already had to fix a [bug in the squaring function BN\_sqr()](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20150108.txt). Back then I already asked myself if it would be worthwhile to use fuzzing to find such bugs. The BN\_sqr() bug was special that it only occurred on very rare occasions. Only one out of 2^128 inputs would produce a wrong result. That effectively means random testing will never find such a bug. However american fuzzy lop has shown to be surprisingly successful in finding hard to find bugs. In a [talk given at the Black Hat conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqW8-MUu09c) Ralph-Philipp Weinmann showed that with a very simple test tool he was able to re-find the BN\_sqr() bug in OpenSSL with american fuzzy lop.

Finding bugs we already know may give interesting insights, but what we really want to do is to find new bugs. I tried various strategies to fuzz bignum libraries. There are two basic options to do so:

1. Do a calculation with one bignum library and check it for consistencies. This depends on the calculation you do. An example would be a division function. If you divide a by b, store the result in r and the remainder in s then r\*b+s must be a again. In case of the BN\_sqr() bug a possibility is simply to compare the result of the squaring with a multiplication of a number by itself. They should produce the same result.

2. Do differential testing with two different implementations. You simply take two different bignum libraries, do the same operation and compare the results.

One small challenge is how you structure the input data. When you have a single input value it is easy: Just take the whole file and interpret it as a number. But for most functions you will have different input values. What I did was that I simply took the first two bytes and used them to decide how to split the rest of the file in pieces. To compare the results I used a simple assert call. In case an assert failure happens american fuzzy lop will detect that.

The BN\_mod\_exp() bug was found by comparing libgcrypt with OpenSSL. Unfortunately I have been sloppy with archiving my code and I lost the exact code that I used to fuzz the bug. But I think I [recreated an almost functionally equivalent example](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/openssl-vs-gcrypt-modexp.c). (I should mention that [libfuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) might be the better tool for this job, but I still haven't gotten around trying it out.)

Fuzzing is usually associated with typical memory corruption bugs. What these examples show is that you can use fuzzing to target entirely different classes of bugs. Essentially fuzz testing can target any kind of bug class that depends on an input and that has a testable failure state. For mathematics the failure state is pretty obvious: If the result of a calculation is wrong then there is a bug.

**Fuzzing versus branch-free code**

After reporting the bug I was asked by the OpenSSL developers if I could do a similar test on their HMAC implementation. I did that and the result is interesting. At first I was confused: A while after the fuzzing started american fuzzy lop was only reporting two code paths. Usually it finds dozends of code paths within seconds.

This happens because cryptographic code is often implemented in a branch-free way. That means that there are no if-blocks that will execute different parts of the code depending on the input. The reason this is done is to protect against all sorts of sidechannel attacks. This conflicts with the way modern fuzzers like american fuzzy lop or libfuzzer work. They use the detection of new code paths as a way to be smart about their inputs.

I don't want to suggest here that branch-free code is bad. I think the advantages of branch-free code are undisputed, but it's interesting to see that it can make fuzz testing harder.

In case you wonder why american fuzzy lop still found two code paths: The reason is likely the input length. The HMAC code is branch-free for each block, but if the block number changes you will get a different code path.

**What's the impact?**

Finally you may ask what the impact of the BN\_mod\_exp() bug is. This is in part still unknown and I can only offer a preliminary analysis.

The BN\_mod\_exp() function is used to exponentiate a number in a modulus (a^b mod m) and is used in many algorithms. It is the core of both RSA and Diffie Hellman. In the case of RSA I think it's unlikely that there is a vulnerability. A potential attacker has basically no control over the input values. The base is either random (RSA exchange) or a hash (DHE/ECDHE exchange). The exponent and the modulus are part of the key. I haven't looked into DSA, because nobody uses it.

Diffie Hellman looks more interesting. I first thought it's not interesting, because usually in a Diffie Hellman key exchange the secret key is only used for one connection. Therefore the only thing an attacker could do is attacking a connection that he himself is part of. That is unlikely to give him anything interesting. But Juraj Somorovsky pointed out to me that OpenSSL caches and reuses the ephemeral key for several Diffie Hellman exchanges until the application restarts. So it might be possible to construct an oracle that will extract this cached ephemeral key. I leave it to people who know more about cryptography and x64 assembly to decide whether that is the case.

The conclusions of the OpenSSl team in the advisory are similar to mine.

OpenSSL has an option to disable this key caching. This can be done by passing the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE (for classic Diffie Hellman) and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_ECDH\_USE (for Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) values to SSL\_CTX\_set\_options(). In my opinion this should be the default, reusing the ephemeral key seems quite dangerous. Many popular applications, including the Apache web server, already set this option.

I invite everyone to analyze this further and try to come up with a practical attack.

*Thanks to Tom Ritter, Ralph-Philipp Weinmann and Juraj Somorovsky for valuable discussions on the topic.*

#### Pascal Cuoq on Friday, December 4. 2015:

You can re-introduce, for the purpose of fuzzing, the if-then-elses that, for the purpose of avoiding timing attacks, have been made into constant-time selections with a patch similar to the one shown here for an old version of OpenSSL:

http://pastebin.com/rdLyQRVU

I think that the code is clearer once the patch is applied (the title of the blog post that goes with the patch is “When in doubt, express intent, and leave the rest to the compiler”), and it remains in my queue of patches to discuss when all null pointer dereferences from failed malloc() calls in OpenSSL are fixed.

#### Richard Könning on Friday, December 4. 2015:

OpenSSL also doesn't cache the ephemeral key when the DH parameters are provided via the callback functions set by SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() or SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback(), the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is only necessary for preventing caching when SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh() or SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used, see e.g. http://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/ssl/SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback.html.

Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by one or more vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.       This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.      Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.      Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

follows:      **OpenSSL BN\_mod\_exp May Produce Incorrect Results on x86\_64**      A vulnerability in the Montgomery multiplication module of OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the library to produce unexpected and possibly weak cryptographic output.      The vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the *BN\_mod\_exp* function. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted application that relies on OpenSSL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause OpenSSL to produce weaker cryptographic protections than expected, possibly allowing the attacker to defeat security protections provided by OpenSSL more easily.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-3193.         **OpenSSL Certificate Processing Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of certificate signatures. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a malicious certificate during the connection to an application using OpenSSL. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause the targeted application to terminate.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-3194.         **OpenSSL X509\_ATTRIBUTE Memory Leak Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an application that uses the OpenSSL library. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause the application to consume available memory resources, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-3195.         **OpenSSL Race Condition Handling PSK Identify Hint**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory operations performed when processing preshared keys. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an application that uses OpenSSL. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause the application to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-3196.         **OpenSSL Anonymous Diffie-Hellman Cipher Suite Denial of Service Vulnerability**       A vulnerability in the anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suite in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper handling of input by the OpenSSL library. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by returning malicious values to a client application using OpenSSL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.        This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-1794.

## [Stack buffer overflow in WolfSSL before 3.13.0](/63-Stack-buffer-overflow-in-WolfSSL-before-3.13.0.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Saturday, March 24. 2018

During some tests of TLS libraries I found a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the WolfSSL library.

Finding this one was surprisingly simple: I had a wolfssl server that was compiled with address sanitizer and ran the SSL Labs test against it.

The bug happens in the parsing of the signature hash algorithm list that is sent in a ClientHello and is basically a textbook stack buffer overflow. WolfSSL simply tries to store that in an array with 32 elements. If one sends more than 32 hash algorithms it overflows.

With the SSL Labs scan the bug only causes WolfSSL to terminate if it's compiled with address sanitizer, but if one sends a very large list of hash algorithms it also crashes in a normal compile. In situations where WolfSSL is used without ASLR this bug is probably trivially exploitable.

I have created a simple [bash proof of concept](https://github.com/hannob/wolfoverflow) (using netcat and xxd) that crashes a WolfSSL server.

The bug was fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/1231/commits/9f7e40ad5c8097ff38d7caff4a9989db260981cc) and in version 3.13.0 of WolfSSL.

## [Optionsbleed - HTTP OPTIONS method can leak Apache's server memory](/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html)

[![optionsbleed](/uploads/optionsbleed.serendipityThumb.png)](/uploads/optionsbleed.png)If you're using the HTTP protocol in everday Internet use you are usually only using two of its methods: GET and POST. However HTTP has a number of other methods, so I wondered what you can do with them and if there are any vulnerabilities.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/cebfb3b02359461ab9ecf10beb28e327)

## [exiv2: multiple memory safety issues](/58-exiv2-multiple-memory-safety-issues.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Monday, July 3. 2017

*This post first appeared on [oss-security](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/30/1).*

I'm reporting three issues here in exiv2, a parser libary for image metadata. These are only examples, exiv2 is full of memory safety bugs that can trivially be found by running afl with asan for a few hours.

I have not reported those issues upstream. When I previously tried to report bugs in exiv2 found via fuzzing the upstream author made it clear to me that he has little interest in fixing those issues and doesn't consider his software suitable to parse defect files (which basically means it's unsuitable for untrusted input). The [discussion can be read here](http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1248). (the page is sometimes not available, searching for it in the google cache usually works though)

exiv2 is to my knowledge used by the major Linux Desktops GNOME and KDE. I'll also inform their security teams. I leave it up to Linux distros how to handle this, but it certainly is problematic that a crucial parser used by major desktop applications is not interested in fixing potential security issues.

## [htpasswDoS: Local Denial of Service via Apache httpd password hashes](/56-htpasswDoS-Local-Denial-of-Service-via-Apache-httpd-password-hashes.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Tuesday, January 10. 2017

![Apache logo](/uploads/apache-httpd-logo.png)The way the Apache httpd web server handles password hashes can be abused by a malicious user on a server to cause resource exhaustion and denial of service of the web server. I reported this a while ago to the Apache security team - which led to a lengthy discussion where I was a bit appalled about some of the statements I got from the Apache developers. They can be summed up in a way that major use cases of Apache - especially in web hosting environments - are not recommended by their developers.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/18d199e9596c4bdb82d4b86de95bc498)

## [Fuzzing Irssi with Perl Scripts](/55-Fuzzing-Irssi-with-Perl-Scripts.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, January 6. 2017

When using fuzzing tools like afl a common challenge is how you can pass input to the interesting parts of the application you want to fuzz. In easy situations we have a tool that will accept our input as a file or via stdin. However sometimes this is not easily possible.

Let's have a look at Irssi, an irc chat client. The only input you can pass on the command line is a config file. Fuzzing Irssi 0.8.10 easily led to [a segfault caused by a null pointer access](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/550). However while bugs in config file parsers probably still should be fixed, usually they are not very interesting. (There [can be exceptions](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/8-Why-it-can-make-sense-to-fuzz-config-files-two-out-of-bounds-vulnerabilities-in-curl-TFPA-0042015.html).)

So what else might be interesting? Irssi does some parsing on all output, e.g. due to [color codes](https://irssi.org/documentation/settings/#a_d). However we can't just print text that is passed via the command line as an input file. We have to abuse Irssi's perl scripting capability for that.

We can place a [simple perl script](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-print.pl) that will read a file (`fuzzp.txt`) and print it into Irssi's autorun directory (default location is ~/.Irssi/scripts/autorun/). We can then place some [examples of Irssi color codes](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/irssi-example-colorcodes.txt) into the directory "in/". I have installed an afl/asan-instrumented Irssi into my system to `/usr/local/`, because for running perl scripts it needs more than just the executable. So we can run afl like this:

`afl-fuzz -i in -o out -m none -f fuzzp.txt Irssi`

afl will put the fuzzed output into `fuzzp.txt` and our autoload script will read it from there. Doing this lets us learn that the sequence "%[" causes Irssi to read an invalid memory byte. For reasons unclear to me this only happens if a script outputs this sequence, not if a user types it in. (This issue got [CVE-2017-5196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5196) assigned.)

We can go further and do a [similar script that executes input as a command](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-command.pl). Commands are things like "/QUIT" that control the application and the channel behavior. I named the input file `fuzzc.txt`, so we can place some [simple Irssi commands](https://gitlab.com/hanno/irssi-fuzzing/blob/master/fuzz-command.pl) into `in/` and run:

`afl-fuzz -i in -o out -m none -f fuzzc.txt Irssi`

Thus we will now fuzz Irssi's command processing.

As we have seen, scripting functionality can be used to fuzz an application. So if you want to fuzz something and don't know how to pass input: See if there's a scripting functionality.

*Irssi has issued a [security advisory for several security vulnerabilities](https://irssi.org/security/irssi_sa_2017_01.txt), including the out of bounds read mentioned above. All vulnerabilities and the config file parser segfault are fixed in 0.8.21 and 1.0.0.*

## [Out of bounds heap bugs in glib, heap buffer overflow in gnome-session](/53-Out-of-bounds-heap-bugs-in-glib%2C-heap-buffer-overflow-in-gnome-session.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, September 16. 2016

By testing GNOME-related packages with Address Sanitizer I recently discovered several trivial to find bugs.

Two out of bounds bugs in the glib library were uncovered by running the test suite with Address Sanitizer enabled. One heap buffer overflow in the parameter parsing of gnome-session was uncovered by trying to start GNOME. Given that these bugs weren't discovered earlier means that most likely nobody ever used Address Sanitizer to test GNOME components.

I strongly recommend to GNOME and to other software communities to use Address Sanitizer testing in order to improve the quality of their software.

## [Multiple vulnerabilities in RPM – and a rant](/52-Multiple-vulnerabilities-in-RPM-and-a-rant.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, August 26. 2016

Last year in November I decided that it might be a good idea to fuzz the parsers of package management tools in Linux distributions. I quickly found a couple of issues in DPKG and RPM. For DPKG the process went very smooth. I reported them to Debian's security team, eight days later fixes and security advisories were published by both Debian and Ubuntu, the main distributions using DPKG. For RPM the process was a bit more difficult.

If you want to report a bug to RPM you first may wonder where to report it. The RPM webpage [1] is a trac installation which has its own bug tracker. However if you try to register an account there you'll get forwarded to an HTTPS site with an expired certificate that doesn't match the domain name. In case you are brave and tell your browser to ignore all warnings you'll be greeted by a broken-looking trac without any CSS. Should you proceed and create an account you will learn that this doesn't help you, because in order to be allowed to report a bug you first have to ask on the mailing list or in the IRC channel for permission [2]. That's probably the point where many well-meaning bug reporters give up.

Okay, but RPM originally stood for “Red Hat package manager” (I've been told that today it stands for RPM Package Manager), so maybe Red Hat feels responsible. So I reported three bugs with sample files triggering them to the Red Hat security team on November 20th. The answer was – to put it mildly – a bit dissatisfying. I'll just fully quote it: “Thanks for the report. We also received about 30+ crash reports in RPM from

a different reporter recently so processing all of them (yours and the

others) will take quite a bit of time. We simply don't have the resources

to spend hours upon hours analyzing all crash reports.”

Okay, so I wasn't the only one fuzzing RPM and the maybe bugs will be fixed some day. I waited. In the meantime I got contacted by another person who also had tried to report fuzzing bugs in RPM and who has made similar experiences (maybe the same person who reported the 30+ crashers, I don't know).

In February I decided to ask what the state of things is. I also gave them a 30 day period until I'd publish the bugs (I know that it's now long past that, I shouldn't have let this issue wait so long). I ended up having a call with a Red Hat security team member and exchanged a couple of mails. I learned that RPM has a Github repository [3], which contains fixes for some (but not all) of the issues I reported, however that's nowhere referenced on its webpage. I then fuzzed the current RPM git code again and found two more issues I also reported to the Red Hat security team.

Status today is that the latest release of RPM on its webpage – 4.12.0.1 - is from July 2015, so all of the bugs still affect this release. However it seems there is an unofficial 4.13 release that's nowhere to be found on the RPM webpage, but Red Hat is using it together with some fixes [4]. And the Github repository says the latest release is 4.12.0, so according to three different sources three different versions are the current one (4.12.0, 4.12.0.1, 4.13).

One of the bugs – a stack overflow (write) - is still present in the latest code on Github.

**Commend and Conclusion**

This blog post probably reads like a big rant about how unprofessional Red Hat is in handling potential security issues. But this is contrary to my usual experience. I often see Red Hat developers being very active in the free software security community and often contributing in a positive way. Quite simply I expect better from Red Hat. This is not some dubious Enterprise vendor where I wouldn't be the least bit surprised of such a reaction.

The development process of RPM seems to be totally chaotic, it's neither clear where one reports bugs nor where one gets the latest code and security bugs don't get fixed within a reasonable time.

There's been some recent events that make me feel especially worried about this: An unknown person has created an entry in the Libarchive issue tracker [5] that points to an anonymous document [6] with a very detailed description of various security weaknesses in the FreeBSD update process (most of them are still unfixed). The most worrying thing about this is however that the anonymous post mentions the existence similar documents affecting multiple Linux distributions. These documents haven't shown up publicly yet and given the unclear nature of this incident it's hard to know whether they ever will become public or exist at all. But this should still be reason enough to have a closer look at potential security vulnerabilities in all pieces of Linux package management systems.

I haven't analyzed the RPM installation process in detail, so I can't say how likely it is that the RPM tool ever sees a malformed input file. It seems downloads happen over HTTP, but the first thing that happens is a signature check. As the signature is part of the RPM file it already needs to be parsed for this. The exact impact of these bugs would require further analysis. But independent of how likely this is I think the parser in such a crucial piece of software should be robust. It should be safe to use the rpm tool to show info about a file on the command line.

Finally one annoying thing to admit: In my original report I included another segfault in headerVerifyInfo() with unclear reasons. However I am now unable to reproduce this one. It may be due to compiler options, different command line parameters or dependencies on my system that have changed. For completeness I'm still providing the sample file:

<https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/rpm-segfault-headerVerifyInfo.rpm>

(Ideally the RPM developers should include all those sample files in a test suite they regularly run against an address sanitizer build of RPM.)

Please also note that I expect this list to be incomplete and there are likely more issues that could be uncovered with further fuzzing. I'll test that once all the existing issues are fixed.

## [Multiple issues in p7zip](/49-Multiple-issues-in-p7zip.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Friday, July 15. 2016

I reported several bugs discovered with afl in p7zip, the portable command line version of the 7-Zip archiving tool, one null pointer access causing a segfault and one out of bounds heap read.

At the time I reported the first issues these were already fixed in the main 7-Zip code, but the portable version hadn't been updated yet. Now there is version 16.02, unfortunately there are still issues left.

[Null pointer access / segfault](https://sourceforge.net/p/p7zip/bugs/182/)

An access to a null pointer in NArchive::N7z::CStreamSwitch::Set can cause p7zip to crash.

[Out of bounds read (bug is not publicly visible yet)](https://sourceforge.net/p/p7zip/bugs/183/)

An out of bounds heap read access can happen in the function NArchive::N7z::CDecoder::Decode.

[Null pointer acctess / segfault (unfixed in 16.02)](https://sourceforge.net/p/p7zip/bugs/184/)

A memory allocation isn't checked for a failing allocation. If the file's header indicates a large data size the allocation will fail and subsequently p7zip will try to write to a null pointer. This will likely only lead to a crash and not to further security issues, however this problem seems prevalent in the 7-zip codebase - there are several memory allocations without a check for failures.

p7zip is often used in security appliances to scan inputs, because it supports a large number of archiving file formats. Vulnerabilities in it have [played a role in previous attacks on Fireeye appliances](http://de.slideshare.net/44Con/44con-london-2015-playing-with-fire-attacking-the-fireeye-mps). Therefore it's worrying that it's so easy to find crashers in it via fuzzing.

There were [also other issues in 7-Zip discovered lately](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/05/multiple-7-zip-vulnerabilities.html).

## [Out of bounds read and signed integer overflow in libarchive](/48-Out-of-bounds-read-and-signed-integer-overflow-in-libarchive.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Thursday, June 23. 2016

I recently wrote about a [large number of bugs and potential security issues in libarchive](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/47-Many-invalid-memory-access-issues-in-libarchive.html). The release 3.2.0 missed one fix for an out of bounds read in the rar parser. Also I discovered one additional signed integer overflow issue with ubsan. Both issues are now fixed in [libarchive 3.2.1](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libarchive-discuss/sui01WaM3ic).

All issues were discovered with the help of american fuzzy lop.

[CVE-2016-5844](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5844)

Also a couple of [other security issues in libarchive were found by Cisco](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/06/the-poisoned-archives.html).

With the release of version 3.2.1 I consider libarchive to be reasonably robust against fuzzing. I've tested all supported file formats and fuzzed each one with afl/asan for at least one day. Of course that doesn't mean that no security issues are left - but the easy to find ones should be wiped out.

## [ImageMagick heap overflow and out of bounds read](/45-ImageMagick-heap-overflow-and-out-of-bounds-read.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, May 11. 2016

Recently the [ImageTragick](https://imagetragick.com/) vulnerability shed some light on the security status of ImageMagick.

This made me wonder how resilient to fuzzing ImageMagick is these days. It's pretty much a posterchild example for a good fuzzing target: Lots of supported complex binary file formats.

I already did some fuzzing on ImageMagick, but as far as I remember that was before I used american fuzzy lop and was done with zzuf. I was also aware that [others did some more thorough fuzzing](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/12/24/1) on ImageMagick.

What I did now was relatively simple: I took a trivial, few pixels PNG and used ImageMagick's "convert" tool to convert it into all file formats that have both read and write support in ImageMagick. I used that to run a fuzzing job with afl and asan. By design ImageMagick will sometimes do huge memory allocations, these can be prevented by setting limits for the width, height and memory usage in the policy.xml file.

I discovered one heap buffer overflow in the PICT parser and one heap out of bounds read in the PSD parser. Given how big the attack surface is this is not terrible, but it shows that despite previous efforts there's still potential to fuzz ImageMagick.

Both issues have been fixed in the versions 6.9.4-0 and 7.0.1-2. In the meantime new versions (6.9.4-1, 7.0.1-3) came out that, as far as I understand [the ChangeLog](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/changelog.php), remove another potential vector for the ImageTragick vulnerabilities, so you should preferrably update to those.

I lately fuzzed various filesystem check tools. This uncovered a number of issues in dosfstools / fsck.fat that have now been fixed in the new version 4.0. All issues were found with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.

These bugs are not exceptionally interesting, but there is something to know when fuzzing PHP and the same applies also to a number of other applications: It uses a custom memory allocator that can sometimes mask issues from memory safety tools like Address Sanitizer. It is therefore good to know about them and disable them during fuzz testing.

With PHP this can be circumvented by setting the environment variable **USE\_ZEND\_ALLOC=0** while fuzzing. This disables the Zend allocator from PHP and uses normal libc memory allocation calls.

I started [documenting such issues and workarounds](https://fuzzing-project.org/tutorial-tips.html).

## [Bugs found with Address Sanitizer in syslog-ng, monit, cmake](/41-Bugs-found-with-Address-Sanitizer-in-syslog-ng%2C-monit%2C-cmake.html)

Lately a couple of updates have fixed issues that I discovered while testing software with Address Sanitizer (ASAN). I'll publish these combined. Once again these show that a lot of software hasn't been tested with ASAN and what kind of bugs it can uncover.

In syslog-ng a function returns an error -1 that gets stored in an unsigned variable. This cannot be stored and a subsequent check for the error value fails, this later leads to a heap out of bounds memory read. This was fixed in syslog-ng 3.7.3.

[syslog-ng 3.7.3 release notes](https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng/releases/tag/syslog-ng-3.7.3)

In the monit system monitoring tool a heap overflow was discovered. A call to sscanf would write a string of length 256 into a 256 byte long buffer. However this fails to consider the trailing zero byte of that string, therefore causing a one byte heap overflow. This was fixed in monit 5.16.

In the compilation tool cmake a use after free error was found. This happened becaused a variable was used in a comparison and was free'd during that comparison operation. This was fixed in cmake 3.5.0.

## [Heap use after free in Pidgin-OTR plugin (CVE-2015-8833)](/39-Heap-use-after-free-in-Pidgin-OTR-plugin-CVE-2015-8833.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, March 9. 2016

The pidgin-otr plugin version 4.0.2 fixes a heap use after free error. The bug is triggered when a user tries to authenticate a buddy and happens in the function create\_smp\_dialog.

The bug was discovered with Address Sanitizer. This is yet another example why all C/C++ code should be tested with Address Sanitizer enabled.

This bug was already independently discovered and reported by Stefan Sperling [in the otr bug tracker](https://bugs.otr.im/issues/88).

Independend of this bug another [more severe bug in Libotr itself was also disclosed today](https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2016-001-libotr/), please make sure you update both libotr (4.1.1) and the pidgin-otr plugin (4.0.2).

## [Miscomputations of elliptic curve scalar multiplications in Nettle](/38-Miscomputations-of-elliptic-curve-scalar-multiplications-in-Nettle.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Tuesday, February 2. 2016

The Nettle library is a library for basic cryptographic functions. Its most prominent user is GnuTLS.

Through fuzzing of elliptic curve scalar multiplications (multiplying a point on an elliptic curve with a scalar number) I discovered two carry propagation bugs that would lead the cauculations to produce wrong results. They affect the NIST P-256 and P-384 curves. The P-256 bug is in the C code and affects multiple architectures. The P-384 bug is in the assembly code and only affects 64 bit x86. Both bugs were found with the help of american fuzzy lop.

While analyzing these bugs Nettle developer Niels Möller discovered another carry propagation bug in P-256 that was fixed in the same commit ([CVE-2015-8805](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8805)). Nettle 3.2 fixes all three bugs.

The impact is currently unclear, but miscalculations in cryptographic functions should generally be considered security issues. I'd like to encourage cryptographers to try to analyze whether these bugs can lead to cryptographic breaks.

I have published a [code example on how to fuzz elliptic curve multiplications](https://github.com/hannob/bignum-fuzz/blob/master/point-fuzz.c). It can compare the output of OpenSSL with either Nettle or NSS. It currently works only with prime field curves, but it can probably be adapted to other curves.
