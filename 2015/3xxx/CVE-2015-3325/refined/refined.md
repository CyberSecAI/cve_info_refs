Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3325:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the WP Symposium WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `$_GET['show']` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the forum feature of the plugin, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `show` parameter. This is a server-side vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes, which could lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Data Modification/Manipulation:** With successful SQL injection, attackers might also be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to data integrity issues and further site compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining user credentials, attackers can gain elevated privileges and potentially take complete control of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the forum page of the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker manipulates the `show` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. It is remotely exploitable.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`show`) and its location, and understand how SQL injection works to craft the malicious queries.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `forum.php` (lines 59-62 and 95-103) and `functions.php` (lines 152-155).
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin prior to 15.4; a fixed version (15.4) was released to address this issue.
- The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of HTTP requests to demonstrate the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept for blind SQL injection.
- The exploit-db entry also includes a command to show how to use sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability and extract user login and password hashes.
- The `CVSS Base Score` for this vulnerability is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
