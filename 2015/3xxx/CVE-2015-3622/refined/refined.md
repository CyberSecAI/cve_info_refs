{
  "CVE-2015-3622": {
    "description": "The _asn1_extract_der_octet function in lib/decoding.c in GNU Libtasn1 before 4.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap read) via a crafted certificate.",
    "affected_component": "libtasn1",
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libtasn1 library decoded certain DER-encoded input.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "heap-based buffer overflow",
       "out-of-bounds heap read"
    ],
     "impact": "A specially crafted DER-encoded input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform an invalid read, causing the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service. In some cases, arbitrary code execution might be possible.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted DER-encoded input (e.g. a certificate) to a vulnerable application."
