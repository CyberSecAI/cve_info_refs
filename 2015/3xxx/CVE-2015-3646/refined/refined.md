Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `backend_argument` configuration option in OpenStack Keystone, used to set options for the caching backend, was not marked as a secret. This resulted in the content of `backend_argument`, which could contain sensitive information such as passwords, being logged in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data (passwords, connection strings, etc.) in the Keystone logs.
- **Lack of Secret Handling:** The configuration option `backend_argument` was not treated as a secret, leading to its inclusion in logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with read access to Keystone logs could obtain credentials for the cache backend.
- This could potentially allow the attacker to access and manipulate the cache data, or potentially use the credentials for lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** The attack vector is through unauthorized or compromised access to the Keystone server logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to read the Keystone server logs. This could be achieved by:
    - Compromising the server hosting keystone and accessing the local logs.
    - Unauthorized access to a centralized logging system where keystone logs are stored.
    - Insider with access to the logs.

**Affected Versions:**
- Keystone versions through 2014.1.4 and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 are affected.
- The 2015.1.0 (kilo) release is not affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not limited to the MongoDB backend; other backends that utilize arguments for authentication could also be impacted, including memcached, and potentially custom implementations.
- The fix involves marking the `backend_argument` option as a secret to prevent its logging.
- The issue was reported by Eric Brown from VMware.
- Patches were released for Icehouse, Juno, and Master branches.
