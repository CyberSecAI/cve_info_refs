### Bug Description

The keystone.conf has an option backend\_argument to set various options for the caching backend. As documented, some of the potential values can contain a password.

Snippet from <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/developing.html#dogpile-cache-based-mongodb-nosql-backend>

[cache]

# Global cache functionality toggle.

enabled = True

# Referring to specific cache backend

backend = keystone.cache.mongo

# Backend specific configuration arguments

backend\_argument = db\_hosts:localhost:27017

backend\_argument = db\_name:ks\_cache

backend\_argument = cache\_collection:cache

backend\_argument = username:test\_user

backend\_argument = password:test\_password

As a result, passwords can be leaked to the keystone logs since the config options is not marked secret.

In case we do issue an advisory, assuming only MongoDB backend is affected, here is the impact description draft:

Title: Keystone cache backend password leak in log

Reporter: Eric Brown (VMware)

Products: Keystone

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3

Description:

Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may obtain the authentication information used to access the cache backend. Only Keystone setup using a password protected MongoDB as a cache backend are impacted.

Tristan: Are you missing a "2014.1" at the beginning of the "Affects" field?

More importantly, there are other backends provided my dogpile that support authentication through "arguments" (which keystone exposes as "backend\_arguments"):

<http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#dogpile.cache.backends.memcached.BMemcachedBackend>

In addition, custom cache backend implementations could also utilize backend\_arguments. All of those would be affected as well.

Dolph: So this bug only originated in Icehouse? You're saying it should be "2014.1 versions through 2014.1.4..." because you don't believe it existed prior to the first 2014.1 release?

Title: Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log

Reporter: Eric Brown (VMware)

Products: Keystone

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3

Description:

Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The backend\_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it may contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a password for MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may therefore obtain sensitive data about certain backends, . All Keystone setups are potentially impacted.

NB: Kilo is not affected.

Release Import of Translations from Transifex

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes

    all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such

    partially translated files will not help users.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does

    not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest

    translations.

====================================================================
OSSA-2015-008: Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log
====================================================================

:Date: May 04, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3646

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: versions through 2014.1.4,
            and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The
backend_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it
may contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a
password for MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs
may therefore obtain sensitive data about certain backends. All
Keystone setups are potentially impacted.

Patches
~~~~~~~
- <https://review.openstack.org/175519> (Icehouse)
- <https://review.openstack.org/173116> (Juno)

Credits
~~~~~~~
- Eric Brown from VMware (CVE-2015-3646)

References
~~~~~~~~~~
- <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1443598>
- <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3646>

Notes
~~~~~
- This fix will be included in future 2014.1.5 (icehouse) and 2014.2.4
  (juno) releases.
- The 2015.1.0 (kilo) release is not affected.

### Bug Description

The keystone.conf has an option backend\_argument to set various options for the caching backend. As documented, some of the potential values can contain a password.

Snippet from <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/developing.html#dogpile-cache-based-mongodb-nosql-backend>

[cache]

# Global cache functionality toggle.

enabled = True

# Referring to specific cache backend

backend = keystone.cache.mongo

# Backend specific configuration arguments

backend\_argument = db\_hosts:localhost:27017

backend\_argument = db\_name:ks\_cache

backend\_argument = cache\_collection:cache

backend\_argument = username:test\_user

backend\_argument = password:test\_password

As a result, passwords can be leaked to the keystone logs since the config options is not marked secret.

In case we do issue an advisory, assuming only MongoDB backend is affected, here is the impact description draft:

Title: Keystone cache backend password leak in log

Reporter: Eric Brown (VMware)

Products: Keystone

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3

Description:

Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may obtain the authentication information used to access the cache backend. Only Keystone setup using a password protected MongoDB as a cache backend are impacted.

Tristan: Are you missing a "2014.1" at the beginning of the "Affects" field?

More importantly, there are other backends provided my dogpile that support authentication through "arguments" (which keystone exposes as "backend\_arguments"):

<http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#dogpile.cache.backends.memcached.BMemcachedBackend>

In addition, custom cache backend implementations could also utilize backend\_arguments. All of those would be affected as well.

Dolph: So this bug only originated in Icehouse? You're saying it should be "2014.1 versions through 2014.1.4..." because you don't believe it existed prior to the first 2014.1 release?

Title: Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log

Reporter: Eric Brown (VMware)

Products: Keystone

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3

Description:

Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The backend\_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it may contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a password for MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may therefore obtain sensitive data about certain backends, . All Keystone setups are potentially impacted.

NB: Kilo is not affected.

Release Import of Translations from Transifex

Manual import of Translations from Transifex. This change also removes

    all po files that are less than 66 per cent translated since such

    partially translated files will not help users.

This change needs to be done manually since the automatic import does

    not handle the proposed branches and we need to sync with latest

    translations.

Make memcache client reusable across threads

memcache.Client is inherited from threading.\_local so instances are only

    accessible from current thread or eventlet. Present workaround broke

    inheritance chain so super() call is unusable.

This patch makes artificial client class mimic inheritance from

    threading.\_local while using generic object methods allowing reusability.
