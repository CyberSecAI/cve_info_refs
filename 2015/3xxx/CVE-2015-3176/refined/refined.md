Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Moodle handles account confirmation links when self-registration is enabled. Specifically, the system discloses the full name of a registered user via the account confirmation link, even to users who are not logged in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of a user's full name to unauthorized individuals.
*   **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The system fails to adequately protect user information by exposing it through a publicly accessible confirmation link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can harvest full names of registered users simply by knowing their usernames. This constitutes a breach of user privacy.
*   **Potential for Social Engineering:** The disclosed information can be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Self-Registration Enabled:** The vulnerability is only present on sites where self-registration is enabled.
*   **Knowledge of Usernames:** The attacker must know a valid username on the system to retrieve the associated full name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need special access or privileges within the Moodle system.
*   The attacker only needs to know the username of the victim.
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.

**Technical Details:**

*   The issue is located in the `/login/confirm.php` file.
*   A partial fix involves removing one line of code in this file.
*   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 2.8 to 2.8.5, 2.7 to 2.7.7, 2.6 to 2.6.10, and earlier unsupported versions.
