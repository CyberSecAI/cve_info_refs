Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient HTML escaping within the `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode` method in Ruby on Rails when encoding a `Hash` containing user-controlled data into JSON.  Specifically, it doesn't properly escape characters, leading to potential XSS when this JSON string is inserted into HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Failure to properly escape user-controlled data when encoding to JSON format allows injection of malicious JavaScript when that JSON is rendered in the HTML page, opening the door to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Stealing sensitive information
   - Defacement of websites
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through rendering user-supplied data that's been JSON-encoded and inserted into an HTML page, using methods such as `Hash#to_json` or `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode`. The vulnerability can occur when JSON strings are directly embedded within `<script>` tags or other HTML contexts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control some data that is then:
  1. Encoded as JSON using vulnerable Rails methods.
  2. Embedded in an HTML document.
- No specific network position is required; the attacker could inject this data through a form, URL parameter, or any mechanism that feeds data into the vulnerable part of the application.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Rails versions 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x but not 4.0.x.
- Fixed versions include 4.2.2 and 4.1.11.
- A workaround is provided as an initializer code snippet.
- Patches are provided for 4.1 and 4.2 series.
- The vulnerability was reported by Francois Chagnon of Shopify.
