on 2015-05-12

### Bug Description

Image data stays in store if image is deleted after creating image using import task

Trying to delete image created using task api (import-from) image gets deleted from the database, but image data remains in the backend.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create image using task api

$ curl -i -X POST -H 'User-Agent: python-glanceclient' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress' -H 'Accept: \*/\*' -H 'X-Auth-Token: 35a9e49237b74eddbe5057eb434b3f9e' -d '{"type": "import", "input": {"import\_from": "<http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.10/ubuntu-14.10-server-i386.iso>", "import\_from\_format": "raw", "image\_properties": {"disk\_format": "raw", "container\_format": "bare", "name": "task\_image"}}}' <http://10.69.4.176:9292/v2/tasks>

2. wait until image becomes active.

3. Confirm image is in active state.

   $ glance image-list

4. Delete the image

   $ glance image-delete <image-id>

5. Verify image-list does not show deleted image

   $ glance image-list

Image gets deleted from the database but image data presents in the backend.

Note:

This issue is fixed in master by this patch <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/181345/4>

This issue will be resolved by back-porting above patch to stable/kilo.

Affected branches: stable/kilo

How is this bug different from [bug 1371118](/bugs/1371118) and [bug 1420696](/bugs/1420696) ?

I guess we better cover this by doing an ERRATA to OSSA-2015-004...

Since this issue relate to the new task flow (as opposed to import task of OSSA 2015-004), I guess it deserve its own OSSA and CVE.

Title: Glance task flow leaks image in backend

Reporter: Abhishek Kekane (NTT)

Products: Glance

Affects: 2015.1.0

Description:

Abhishek Kekane from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By creating numerous images using the import task flow API and deleting them, an authenticated attacker may accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All glance setups are affected.

For the impact description in comment #7, let's try to avoid non-vulnerability-related uses of the overloaded term "leak" to reduce confusion. How about switching the title to something like "Glance task flow may fail to delete image from backend".

How is this bug different from [bug 1371118](/bugs/1371118) and [bug 1420696](/bugs/1420696) ?

I guess we better cover this by doing an ERRATA to OSSA-2015-004...

Since this issue relate to the new task flow (as opposed to import task of OSSA 2015-004), I guess it deserve its own OSSA and CVE.

Title: Glance task flow leaks image in backend

Reporter: Abhishek Kekane (NTT)

Products: Glance

Affects: 2015.1.0

Description:

Abhishek Kekane from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By creating numerous images using the import task flow API and deleting them, an authenticated attacker may accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All glance setups are affected.

For the impact description in comment #7, let's try to avoid non-vulnerability-related uses of the overloaded term "leak" to reduce confusion. How about switching the title to something like "Glance task flow may fail to delete image from backend".
