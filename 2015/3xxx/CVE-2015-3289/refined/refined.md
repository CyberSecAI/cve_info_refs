Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly delete image data from the backend storage when an image is deleted after being created via the Glance task API's import functionality. When an image is created using the task API, and then deleted, the database record for the image is removed, but the actual image data remains in the backend storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete deletion:** The core issue is that the image deletion process does not remove the associated image data from the backend storage. This can be considered a resource management issue where the system fails to clean up after an operation.
- **Lack of synchronization:** There is a lack of proper synchronization between the database record of an image and the actual image data stored in the backend.
- **Resource Leakage:** Image data is not being removed from backend storage leading to a resource leak, where storage is being used without being tracked or freed when the image is considered deleted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating numerous images via the import task API and then deleting them. This would lead to the accumulation of untracked image data in the backend storage. This can exhaust storage resources, eventually causing a denial of service.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Continued exploitation will lead to a resource exhaustion state on the backend storage, potentially causing stability issues in the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Glance task API (specifically the "import-from" functionality)
- The attacker creates images using the task API, then deletes them through the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create and delete images via the Glance API.
- **Access to Glance API:** The attacker must have access to the Glance API endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in OpenStack Glance version 2015.1.0 (Kilo release)
- The issue is related to the new task flow introduced in Kilo.
- Patches were created to address the issue, specifically:
    -   `https://review.openstack.org/#/c/181816/` (for Kilo)
    -   `https://review.openstack.org/#/c/181345/` (for Liberty)

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
The CVE-2015-3289 is a vulnerability in OpenStack Glance where image data is not properly deleted from the backend storage when images created with the task API's import function are deleted. This can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS attacks if exploited by an authenticated user.
