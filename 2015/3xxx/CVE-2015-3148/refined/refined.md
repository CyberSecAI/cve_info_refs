Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how cURL and libcurl handle Negotiate authentication. Specifically, when a connection is established using Negotiate along with NTLM, the entire connection is incorrectly treated as authenticated rather than just the specific HTTP request. This behavior allows the connection to be reused for subsequent requests even if different credentials are provided, which effectively bypasses the authentication step.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Connection Reuse:** libcurl incorrectly reuses Negotiate-authenticated connections.
*   **Bypassed Authentication:** Subsequent requests over the reused connection do not enforce proper authentication, potentially using credentials from the initial, authenticated request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker could send HTTP requests over a connection authenticated as a different user. This could grant access to resources that should have been protected by authentication.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** By sending requests with the wrong user context, an attacker could modify data with the identity of another user.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the resources exposed, an attacker could possibly gain access to sensitive information through this unauthorized connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over a network connection.
*   **HTTP:** The attack uses HTTP requests with Negotiate and NTLM authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP requests using the vulnerable version of cURL.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know or be able to manipulate the target server to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Special Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require specific credentials for the targeted system as they exploit the improper reuse of authentication.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2014-0015, but it affects scenarios where subsequent requests do not explicitly ask for NTLM authentication.
*  While some sources mention a denial-of-service potential, the primary impact is the bypass of authentication and potential for unauthorized access.
