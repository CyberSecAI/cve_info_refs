## Updated curl packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 03 May 2015

Modification date: 03 May 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2015-3143](CVE-2015-3143.html)
,
[CVE-2015-3145](CVE-2015-3145.html)
,
[CVE-2015-3148](CVE-2015-3148.html)

## Description

```
Updated curl packages fix security vulnerabilities:

NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests without
any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent over the connection
authenticated as a different user (CVE-2015-3143).

When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's "path" element consists of a
single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an invalid heap memory
address. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) (CVE-2015-3145).

When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method along with
NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as authenticated, making it
possible to reuse it and send requests for one user over the connection
authenticated as a different user (CVE-2015-3148).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1254)

## Topic

Updated curl packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP,
FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able
to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw
to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related
issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication
of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS
option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the
application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs
with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP
proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or
construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the wrong
authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials for HTTP
Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in subsequent requests,
although a different set of credentials was specified. (CVE-2015-3143,
CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.

Bug fixes:

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was available

with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force downgrade of the
SSL version. The fallback has been removed from libcurl. Users requiring
this functionality can explicitly enable SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API.
(BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the destination

file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the file, two events
were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened only once per upload.
(BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate

unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the "--retry" option with the curl utility could cause curl to

terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding "--retry" no
longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The "curl --trace-time" command did not use the correct local time when

printing timestamps. Now, "curl --trace-time" works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks on

curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape Portable
Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer reports the memory
leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the

CURLINFO\_HEADER\_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own headers to
the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid. (BZ#1161163)

Enhancements:

* The "--tlsv1.0", "--tlsv1.1", and "--tlsv1.2" options are available for

specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated by NSS.
The "--tlsv1" option now negotiates the highest version of the TLS protocol
supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the new

AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

The function is called after the host name has been extracted from the URL libcurl has been told to act on.  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "<http://:80>" or just ":80", `fix_hostname()` will index the host name pointer with a -1 offset (as it blindly assumes a non-zero length) and both read and assign that address.  At best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have not researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this could be used for.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also be triggered with the curl command line tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3144 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.37.0 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.42.0 better verifies the input string to the affected function.  A patch for this problem is available at [URL will be updated]:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3144.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using URLs with zero-length host names!  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on April 16 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 17th.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3144 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3148

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:

CVE-2015-3143

    NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests
    without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent
    over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is
    similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.

CVE-2015-3144

    When parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as "<http://:80">;),
    libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This
    issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)
    distributions.

CVE-2015-3145

    When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's "path" element
    consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an
    invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the
    upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.

CVE-2015-3148

    When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method
    along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as
    authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for
    one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy13.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.42.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

When doing HTTP requests NTLM authenticated, the entire connnection becomes authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works. This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the code. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further authentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.  libcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for re-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to pick a connection with matching credentials only.  If a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a specific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get re-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but without having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already authenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get sent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.  This problem is very similar to the previous problem known as [CVE-2014-0015](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20140129.html>). The main difference this time is that the subsequent request that wrongly re-use a connection doesn't ask for NTLM authentication.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3143 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.42.0 makes sure that a connection that is re-used also have to have a matching set of credentials if it would re-use a connection already using NTLM.  A patch for this problem is available at:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3143.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using NTLM with libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on February 24 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 16th.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

Together with each individual cookie there are several different properties, but for this vulnerability we focus on the associated "path" element. It tells information about for which path on a given host the cookies is valid.  The internal libcurl function called `sanitize_cookie_path()` that cleans up the path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that consisted of a single double-quote, libcurl would index a newly allocated memory area with index -1 and assign a zero to it, thus destroying heap memory it wasn't supposed to.  At best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have not researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this could be used for.  Applications have to explicitly enable cookie parsing in libcurl for this problem to trigger, and if not enabled libcurl will not hit this problem.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3145 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.42.0 better verifies the input string.  A patch for this problem is available at [URL will be updated]:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3145.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using cookies with libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on April 16 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 17th.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

# USN-2591-1: curl vulnerabilities

30 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in curl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Paras Sethia discovered that curl could incorrectly re-use NTLM HTTP

credentials when subsequently connecting to the same host over HTTP.

([CVE-2015-3143](/security/CVE-2015-3143))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled zero-length host names.

If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted

host name, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3144](/security/CVE-2015-3144))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookie path elements.

If a user or automated system were tricked into parsing a specially crafted

cookie, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3145](/security/CVE-2015-3145))

Isaac Boukris discovered that when using Negotiate authenticated

connections, curl could incorrectly authenticate the entire connection and

not just specific HTTP requests. ([CVE-2015-3148](/security/CVE-2015-3148))

Yehezkel Horowitz and Oren Souroujon discovered that curl sent HTTP headers

both to servers and proxies by default, contrary to expectations. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. ([CVE-2015-3153](/security/CVE-2015-3153))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-04-20 11:10:54 UTC  ``` libcurl keeps a pool of its last few connections around after use to fascilitate easy, conventient and completely transparent connection re-use for applications.  When doing HTTP requests Negotiate authenticated, the entire connnection may become authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works, as Negotiate can basically use NTLM under the hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such requests would also be authenticated per request.  The net effect is that libcurl may end up re-using an authenticated Negotiate connection and sending subsequent requests on it using new credentials, while the connection remains authenticated with a previous initial credentials setup.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.41.0  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Isaac Boukris as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-22 07:55:29 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422B.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-22 07:57:15 UTC  ```  Created curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1214183](show_bug.cgi?id=1214183 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3148 curl: \"Negotiate\" not treated as connection-oriented [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-04-23 09:53:16 UTC  ``` Note: Upstream states that the patch for libcurl 7.42.0 is only a workaround.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-04-23 14:32:57 UTC  ```  Created mingw-curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1214795](show_bug.cgi?id=1214795 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3148 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3144 mingw-curl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1214796](show_bug.cgi?id=1214796 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3148 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3144 mingw-curl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-04-23 14:38:39 UTC  ``` Workaround patch: <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3148.patch>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1213351#c8)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=15746#c0)  David Walser    2015-04-22 16:58:58 CEST  ``` cURL 7.42.0 has been released today (April 22): <http://curl.haxx.se/changes.html#7_42_0>  There are 4 associated security advisories: <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422D.html> (CVE-2015-3144) <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422C.html> (CVE-2015-3145) <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422B.html> (CVE-2015-3148) <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422A.html> (CVE-2015-3143)  We have curl 7.34.0 in Mageia 4, which the advisory says is not affected by CVE-2015-3144.  The linked upstream patches for CVE-2015-3143 and CVE-2015-3145 apply cleanly to 7.34.0.  The CVE-2015-3148 patch does not apply, and looking at the code, I don't see how 7.34.0 is affected, even though the advisory says that it is.  Dan, do you have any insight on this?  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2015-04-22 16:59:12 CEST   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA5TOO, MGA4TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=15746#c1)  David Walser    2015-04-22 17:25:24 CEST  ``` Debian has issued an advisory for this today (April 22): <https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2015/msg00120.html>  I see in this commit for wheezy where they had to also add an intermediate commit to introduce the code that was patched in the CVE-2015-3148 patch: <http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/curl.git/commit/?h=wheezy&id=3f23fac29df7fe42fab32e32152c1f3102cab9e4>  It's not clear to me how this isn't just introducing the vulnerability and then fixing it, but I guess I'm missing something.  I'll add the additional patch. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=15746#c2)  David Walser    2015-04-22 17:39:29 CEST  ``` Patches checked into Mageia 4 and Cauldron SVN.

Frankly, I'm a bit surprised Negotiate worked at all without that patch (Negotiate is not covered by the curl test suite, unfortunately). It's the connclose() call in the CVE-3148 patch that fixes the security issue, and it could also have been applied by rediffing the patch. But, I think the current set of patches in SVN is a better solution; I'm happy with what I see there now. Thanks for taking care of this. ```  Dan Fandrich    2015-04-22 22:43:33 CEST   Assignee: dan => luigiwalser  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15746#c4)  David Walser    2015-04-24 17:05:11 CEST  ``` Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 4 and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated curl packages fix security vulnerabilities:  NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent over the connection authenticated as a different user (CVE-2015-3143).  When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's "path" element consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) (CVE-2015-3145).  When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for one user over the connection authenticated as a different user (CVE-2015-3148).

When doing HTTP requests Negotiate authenticated, the entire connnection may become authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works, as Negotiate can basically use NTLM under the hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such requests would also be authenticated per request.  The net effect is that libcurl may end up re-using an authenticated Negotiate connection and sending subsequent requests on it using new credentials, while the connection remains authenticated with a previous initial credentials setup.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3148 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE WORK-AROUND ---------------  libcurl 7.42.0 closes Negotiate connections after they're done, effectively preventing wrongful re-use. We decided to do this blunt short-term fix to avoid this current problem and then continue to work on a better fix.  A patch for this problem is available at:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3148.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using Negotiate with libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on March 31 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 18.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
