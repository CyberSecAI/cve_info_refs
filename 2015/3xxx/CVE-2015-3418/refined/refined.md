  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2015-3418": {
      "root_cause": "The length checking code in `ProcPutImage` function validates PutImage height and byte width by making sure that `byte-width >= INT32_MAX / height`. If height is zero, this generates a divide by zero exception.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Divide-by-zero vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "A zero height value in a `PutImage` request would cause a divide by zero exception leading to a crash (Denial of Service).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted PutImage request with a zero height value to the X server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker capable of sending X11 protocol requests could trigger the vulnerability."
