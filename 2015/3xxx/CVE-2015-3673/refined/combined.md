##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# About the security content of OS X Yosemite v10.10.4 and Security Update 2015-005

This document describes the security content of OS X Yosemite v10.10.4 and Security Update 2015-005.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](https://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201601).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other security updates, see [Apple security updates](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222).

## OS X Yosemite v10.10.4 and Security Update 2015-005

* **Admin Framework**

  Available for: OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.3

  Impact: A process may gain admin privileges without proper authentication

  Description: An issue existed when checking XPC entitlements. This issue was addressed through improved entitlement checking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-3671 : Emil Kvarnhammar at TrueSec

* **Admin Framework**

  Available for: OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.3

  Impact: A non-admin user may obtain admin rights

  Description: An issue existed in the handling of user authentication. This issue was addressed through improved error checking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-3672 : Emil Kvarnhammar at TrueSec

* **Admin Framework**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.3

  Impact: An attacker may abuse Directory Utility to gain root privileges

  Description: Directory Utility was able to be moved and modified to achieve code execution within an entitled process. This issue was addressed by limiting the disk location that writeconfig clients may be executed from.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-3673 : Patrick Wardle of Synack, Emil Kvarnhammar at TrueSec

* **afpserver**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.3

  Impact: A remote attacker may be able to cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue existed in the AFP server. This issue was addressed through improved memory handling.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2015-3674 : Dean Jerkovich of NCC Group

* **apache**

  Available for: OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.3

  Impact: An attacker may be able to access directories that are protected with HTTP authentication without knowing the correct credentials

  Description: The default Apache configuration did not include mod\_hfs\_apple. If Apache was manually enabled and the configuration was not changed, some files that should not be accessible might have been accessible using a specially crafted URL.
