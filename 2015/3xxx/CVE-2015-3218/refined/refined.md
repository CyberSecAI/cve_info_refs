Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-3218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `authentication_agent_new` function within `polkitbackend/polkitbackendinteractiveauthority.c`. The code doesn't properly check if an error occurred during the construction of a proxy object for an authentication agent before dereferencing a pointer to the error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference. The code attempts to access an error message via `error->message` without verifying if the `error` pointer itself is valid (non-NULL).
*  **Lack of Input Validation:**  The vulnerability arises because the `RegisterAuthenticationAgent` is called with an invalid object path. The function should validate the provided object path, but does not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user can trigger a crash of the `polkitd` daemon by calling `RegisterAuthenticationAgent` with an invalid object path. This crash leads to a denial of service for the PolicyKit system, which is crucial for managing privileges.
*   **Possible Privilege Escalation:** Although not the primary impact of CVE-2015-3218, some sources indicate that successful exploitation might result in privilege escalation due to the way the flawed code might be used in other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target system.
*   **D-Bus Interaction:** The attack involves calling the `RegisterAuthenticationAgent` function via D-Bus, which is used for inter-process communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system; no special privileges are required beyond that.
*   **Ability to Interact with D-Bus:** The attacker must be able to send D-Bus messages.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tavis Ormandy from Google Project Zero.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PolicyKit version 0.113 and later.
*  SUSE rates the vulnerability as having moderate severity
* Ubuntu states that this issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
