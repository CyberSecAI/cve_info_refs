The provided content describes a vulnerability, but it is related to **CVE-2015-2781**, not CVE-2015-3319.

**CVE-2015-2781 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HotExBilling Manager software.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Additionally, the HttpOnly flag is missing from cookies, which could allow an attacker to steal the `document.cookie` with a successful XSS attack.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser. If an attacker hijacks the admin user's cookie, they could gain control of the HotEx device, guest accounts, and payment details.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `reply` parameter in the `hotspotlogin.cgi` script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any specific prerequisites other than access to the vulnerable application. An attacker can inject malicious scripts via a crafted URL and it will execute in users browser.
