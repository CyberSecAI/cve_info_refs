- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were discovered in the "contacts" application of ownCloud.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the contacts application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the compromised data. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies or session tokens, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "contacts" application shipped with ownCloud.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the contact information, which is then stored and displayed to other users. This likely requires the attacker to be an authenticated user of the ownCloud instance.
