Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-3160

**Root Cause:**
- The Beaker application was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to improper handling of external entity references within job XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Injection:** The application's XML parser processed user-supplied job XML without properly sanitizing or disabling external entity resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could craft malicious XML payloads with external entity references (e.g., using `SYSTEM` keyword to point to local files) that would allow them to read arbitrary files from the Beaker server's file system that are accessible by the web server user (usually 'apache' user).
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including Kerberos keytabs, database passwords (located in `/etc/beaker/server.cfg`), and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Payload:** The attack vector is through the submission of crafted XML documents containing malicious external entity references when submitting a job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid Beaker user account. The vulnerability is not exploitable by anonymous users.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example XML payload demonstrates how an attacker could use the `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >` to read the contents of `/etc/passwd`. When the server processes the job XML, it would resolve this entity, include the file content in the job whiteboard, and thereby disclose it to the user through the web UI.
- The fix implemented in the patch involves using a custom XML parser (`xmltramp_parse_untrusted`) which disables external entity resolution. The `SafeSeeder` class raises a ValueError when an external entity is encountered.
- The patch includes a new test case to ensure that XML external entities are rejected.

**Patch Information:**
- The patch modifies the files `IntegrationTests/src/bkr/inttest/server/selenium/test_jobs.py`, `Server/bkr/server/jobs.py`, and `Server/bkr/server/util.py`.
- Specifically, the change in `Server/bkr/server/util.py` disables external entities by using a custom Seeder.
- The `xmltramp_parse_untrusted` function has been introduced to parse untrusted (user-supplied) XML.
- The fix was released in Beaker version 20.1.
