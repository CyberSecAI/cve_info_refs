  "CVE-2015-3649": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `open-uri-cached` gem creates a cache directory under `/tmp` based on the Process UID, and stores downloaded files there. This allows for a local privilege escalation if an attacker can create a directory with a matching UID before the application creates it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure use of /tmp directory",
        "Potential for code execution from untrusted location"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation through arbitrary code execution. An attacker may be able to overwrite files or execute malicious code",
      "attack_vector": "Local attacker can create a directory in /tmp with the same user id as the victim",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Local access and ability to predict/match the user ID of the target user"
    },
     "additional_notes": "The provided content mentions that issues related to YAML deserialization and symlink following were also considered, but determined to be out of scope for this CVE. It also highlights the use of `YAML.load` which could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if used with untrusted input."
