Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** issue.
*   The `tcp_box_path` HTTP POST parameter, when passed to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=checkout_editor_settings`, is not properly validated.
*   The plugin uses this parameter in a PHP `include()` function without sanitizing it for directory traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate the `tcp_box_path` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** While not the primary vulnerability, the exploit notes that the LFI vulnerability can be leveraged using a CSRF attack, because the vulnerable script is vulnerable to CSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** By including files such as `/etc/passwd`, an attacker can access sensitive system information.
*   **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the included files, the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `tcp_box_path` HTTP POST parameter.
*   **Web Request:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to a specific URL.
*   **CSRF:** Using a crafted form, a logged-in admin can be tricked to trigger the inclusion of the attacker's supplied file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Administrator Privileges:** To directly exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need administrator privileges on the WordPress installation. However, this requirement can be bypassed by exploiting the vulnerability via CSRF.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and use of the `tcp_box_path` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in TheCartPress WordPress plugin, version 1.3.9 and likely earlier versions.
*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to use directory traversal to read the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
*   The exploit can be triggered via a CSRF attack.
*   The plugin is no longer supported by the vendor.
