  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mContext field in OpenSSLX509Certificate was being serialized, which should not happen as it is a transient field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper serialization of transient field.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could lead to an invalid state of the OpenSSLX509Certificate object after deserialization, which can cause undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "Deserialization of a crafted serialized OpenSSLX509Certificate object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to control or manipulate the serialized data of the OpenSSLX509Certificate object that is being deserialized."
