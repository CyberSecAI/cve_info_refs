Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing include of the `<epan/wmem/wmem.h>` header file in the `epan/dissectors/packet-dec-dnart.c` dissector within Wireshark. This header is required to properly declare the `wmem_strdup()` function as returning a pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** Due to the missing header, the compiler incorrectly assumes `wmem_strdup()` returns an integer instead of a pointer, leading to the truncation of the 64-bit pointer to an int on LP64 platforms.  This corrupted pointer value is then used later, resulting in a crash. Specifically, when `strlen()` is called on an invalid address (garbled pointer value) which results from a type mismatch with the return value of the `wmem_strdup()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash in Wireshark when processing a specially crafted network capture file (`genbroad.snoop`). This crash effectively leads to a denial of service for users attempting to analyze this specific file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Capture File:** The attack vector involves providing a malicious or crafted `.snoop` network capture file, like the `genbroad.snoop` file, to Wireshark (or tshark) for analysis.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to supply or convince a Wireshark user to open the crafted `.snoop` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code exists in Wireshark versions 1.10.x (specifically x >=12) due to a backport of the `wmem_strdup()` call without including the necessary header.
*   The issue was fixed by including the missing header file (`<epan/wmem/wmem.h>`) and has been addressed in Wireshark version 1.10.15.
*   The vulnerability is specific to 64-bit systems due to the pointer truncation.
*   The provided information also indicates that Red Hat has addressed this issue in the `RHSA-2015:2393` errata.
*   Gentoo also issued an advisory (GLSA 201510-03) about this vulnerability which indicates that versions of Wireshark `< 1.12.7` are affected.
