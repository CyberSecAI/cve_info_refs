| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-07 09:20:32 UTC  ``` It was found that Wireshark crashes when processing (with "tshark -nr genbroad.snoop") a sample file from the Wireshark wiki page:  wget '<http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=genbroad.snoop>' -O genbroad.snoop  Additional details:  * crash reason: strlen() called on invalid pointer (value 0x56998680 == 1452902016) * the function set_dnet_address at packet-dec-dnart.c:355 * it is called 4 times * the 2nd time is the one when the value is set * the variable is called addr in the context of /epan/dissectors/packet-dec-dnart.c:357, function set_dnet_address * the variable is called pinfo->src->data in the upper frames * in this function, this macro modifies the value: SET_ADDRESS(paddr_tgt, AT_STRINGZ, 1, wmem_strdup(pinfo->pool, addr)); * it should set paddr_tgt->data = addr, but the value gets garbled by the ctlq instruction: .. |0x7ffff4d85522 dnet_address+50> callq 0x7ffff4b0d4b0 <wmem_strdup@plt> |0x7ffff4d85527 dnet_address+55> cltq ..  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Martin Žember of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-07 09:20:59 UTC  ```  Created wireshark tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1219410](show_bug.cgi?id=1219410 "CLOSED EOL - wireshark: crash on same file genbroad.snoop [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c3)  Guy Harris    2015-05-26 23:16:10 UTC  ``` This bug is due to a failure by the epan/dissectors/packet-dec-dnart.c dissector to include the <epan/wmem/wmem.h> header to properly declare the wmem_strdup() routine as returning a pointer, so, on LP64 platforms, its 64-bit pointer result gets shortened to an int and then widened back to a pointer.  This bug should not exist in Wireshark 1.12.x, for all values of x, as the change that introduced the call to wmem_strdup() in packet-dec-dnart.c also added an include of <epan/wmem/wmem.h>.  However, it *does* exist in 1.10.x, for at least some values of x, as, when the change in question was backported, the include was *not* added.  I have checked in a change to fix this:      <https://code.wireshark.org/review/8661>  That fix, along with      <https://code.wireshark.org/review/8660>  which is a fix for *another* problem revealed by compiling with -Werror (-Werror is your friend!), and possibly other fixes I check in as I fix more -Werror-detected problems, should be in the next 1.10.x Wireshark release, which should be 1.10.15.  It has not yet been scheduled.  If you want to pick up individual fixes, go ahead.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c4)  Guy Harris    2015-05-26 23:28:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Guy Harris from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c3)) > However, it *does* exist in 1.10.x, for at least some values of x  In particular, for x >= 12.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1219409#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-11-19 12:37:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:2393 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2393.html>   ``` |  |
