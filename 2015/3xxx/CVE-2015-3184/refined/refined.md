  "CVE-2015-3184": {
    "description": "Subversion's mod_authz_svn does not properly restrict anonymous access in some mixed anonymous/authenticated environments when using Apache httpd 2.4.  The result is that anonymous access may be possible to files for which only authenticated access should be possible. The protected files and directories will not show on directory listings.  Protected directories that do not show in their parent will return an empty directory listing rather than a 403 error.  Protected files will return the full content of the file. Specifically the conditions required for this to happen is that there needs to be a <Directory> block for the DocumentRoot allowing access to everyone (e.g. Require all granted) and \"Satisfy any\" must not be set.",
