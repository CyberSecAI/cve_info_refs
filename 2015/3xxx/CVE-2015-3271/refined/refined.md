- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache Tika server (tika-server) allows remote clients to specify a `fileUrl` header. The server fetches content from the provided URL, including local files, if allowed by file permissions.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information disclosure vulnerability: The server can be tricked into returning the content of local files if the attacker provides a `fileUrl` with a local file path.
    - Lack of proper input validation:  The server doesn't validate the `fileUrl` to prevent access to local files.
    
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can potentially read sensitive content from the server's local filesystem, such as configuration files, password files, or other private data. The impact is dependent on the server's local file permissions.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to send a PUT request to the `/tika` endpoint of the tika-server, including the vulnerable `fileUrl` header.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable tika-server instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. They do not need any prior credentials or authentication.
