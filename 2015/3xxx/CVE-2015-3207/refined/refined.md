Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2015-3207:

**Summary:**

The provided content discusses two pull requests related to cookie security in the `openshift/origin` project.  While neither directly describes a vulnerability, they provide context and fix for the issues related to the secure flags of cookies, that might relate to the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3207.

**Pull Request #2261: "Make csrf and session cookies httpOnly"**

*   **Root Cause:** This pull request addresses the need to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing CSRF and session cookies. This is achieved by setting the `HttpOnly` flag on these cookies.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability, not explicitly described in the content, would likely be related to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack that could steal session or CSRF tokens if the cookies were accessible by Javascript. By setting the `HttpOnly` flag, this attack vector is mitigated.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** If the cookies were not `HttpOnly`, a successful XSS attack could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized actions via CSRF, and potential compromise of user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows the injection of malicious Javascript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject and execute JavaScript code within the context of a user's session with the OpenShift application.

**Pull Request #2291: "Use secure csrf/session cookies when serving on HTTPS"**

*   **Root Cause:** This pull request ensures that CSRF and session cookies are marked as `Secure` when the application is served over HTTPS. The `Secure` flag restricts the cookie to be sent only over secure channels.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Without the secure flag, a man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially intercept the cookie if the user was not on HTTPS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Without the `Secure` flag, an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack could potentially intercept session cookies when users access the application via an insecure connection (HTTP).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Man-in-the-Middle attack on insecure network when the application is accessed without HTTPS.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be positioned on the network path between the user and the OpenShift application, and the user would need to be accessing the application over an insecure HTTP connection.

**Relationship to CVE-2015-3207 (Implied):**

*   The pull requests and associated discussion are related to the broader issue of secure cookie handling, which is likely connected to CVE-2015-3207.
*   The fixes implemented in these pull requests (setting `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags) are common mitigations for web application security vulnerabilities involving cookies.
*   While the provided content does not explicitly state that these changes fix CVE-2015-3207, the mentioned bugzilla link in PR #2261 suggests they are addressing the same security issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub pull requests provide more granular information about the specific changes made and the reasoning behind them than a typical CVE description.
*   The Bugzilla link is inaccessible but likely contains more detail about the specific vulnerability.

**In Summary:** The content relates to the security vulnerability CVE-2015-3207 and provides important information about the fixes implemented by setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on the affected cookies in the openshift application.
