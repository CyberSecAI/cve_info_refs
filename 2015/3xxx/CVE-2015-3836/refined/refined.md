DLS parser: fix wave pool size check.

Bug: 21132860.
Change-Id: I8ae872ea2cc2e8fec5fa0b7815f0b6b31ce744ff
(cherry picked from commit 2d7f8e1be2241e48458f5d3cab5e90be2b07c699)
```

Based on the commit message, the following information can be extracted:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The commit message indicates a fix for a "wave pool size check" in the DLS parser. This suggests that the original code did not properly validate the size of a wave pool, which could lead to an issue when parsing DLS (Downloadable Sounds) files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An improper size check when parsing DLS files may lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue. Without a proper size validation the parser could try to allocate or access memory outside the allocated boundaries.

- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the specific nature of the memory corruption.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the processing of a crafted DLS file that has a malicious wave pool size.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the vulnerable system to trigger the issue. The attacker needs to be able to get the device to parse the malicious DLS file.

**Additional Notes**: This commit message provides more detail than the typical CVE description, explaining that the vulnerability lies in the DLS parser's wave pool size check.
