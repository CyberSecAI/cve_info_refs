The provided content discusses CVE-2015-3252, a security vulnerability related to VNC authentication in Apache CloudStack.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause isn't explicitly detailed in the provided text. However, the mention of "VNC authentication" implies an issue in how CloudStack handles VNC authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a weakness in VNC authentication. The blog post describes it as having "low severity". This could suggest a bypass, or insufficient enforcement in the VNC authentication mechanism used within the Apache CloudStack. 

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not described in detail but is indicated as low severity suggesting that the impact is not critical, but may include unauthorized access to VNC console sessions.

**Attack vectors:** This is not detailed, but the attack vector would likely be via the VNC interface itself, since it relates to how the application handles VNC authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** While not explicitly stated, the attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the VNC interface of a CloudStack managed VM.
