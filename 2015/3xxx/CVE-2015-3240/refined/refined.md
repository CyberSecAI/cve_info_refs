{
  "CVE-2015-3240": {
    "Description": "The NSS library returns NULL when DiffieHellman exponentiation fails. The IKE daemon pluto verifies that the result is not NULL and triggers a passert() when it is NULL. This causes the IKE daemon pluto to restart.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check for a zero DH g^x value in a KE payload within an IKE packet when using NSS. When the DH exponentiation fails the NSS library returns NULL, which triggers a passert and causes the IKE daemon to restart.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL return from NSS during DH exponentiation",
      "Lack of input validation for DH g^x values"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by causing the IKE daemon (pluto) to crash and restart repeatedly.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted IKE packet with a zero DH g^x value.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a single crafted IKE packet. No authentication is required."
