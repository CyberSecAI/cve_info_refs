# Libreswan: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libreSwan possibly
resulting in Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/libreswan** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.15** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.15** |

### Background

Libreswan is a free software implementation of the most widely supported
and standarized VPN protocol based on (“IPsec”) and the Internet Key
Exchange (“IKE”).

### Description

The pluto IKE daemon in Libreswan, when built with NSS, allows remote
attackers to cause a Denial of Service (assertion failure and daemon
restart) via a zero DH g^x value in a KE payload in a IKE packet.
Additionally, remote attackers could cause a Denial of Service (daemon
restart) via an IKEv1 packet with (1) unassigned bits set in the IPSEC
DOI value or (2) the next payload value set to ISAKMP\_NEXT\_SAK.

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Libreswan users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/libreswan-3.15"

```
### References

* [CVE-2015-3204](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2015-3204)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
CVE-2015-3240 libreswan/openswan: denial of service via IKE daemon restart
when receiving a bad DH gx by peer
URL: http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-3240
This alert (and any possible updates) is available at the following URLs:
https://libreswan.org/security/CVE-2015-3240/
The Libreswan Project discovered that receiving a g^x value of zero from
an unauthenticated remote peer was not handled properly by the pluto IKE
daemon, causing the pluto IKE daemon to restart. The vulnerability is
present in libreswan and its predecessor openswan.
Vulnerable versions: libreswan up to version 3.14
openswan (if compiled with NSS) up to version 2.6.44
Not vulnerable : libreswan 3.15 and newer
If you cannot upgrade to libreswan 3.15, please see the above link for a
patch for this issue.
Vulnerability information
- -------------------------
The NSS library returns NULL when DiffieHellman exponentiation fails. The
IKE daemon pluto verifies that the result is not NULL and triggers a
passert() when it is NULL. This causes the IKE daemon pluto to restart.
Exploitation
- ------------
This denial of service can be launched by anyone using a single IKE packet.
No authentication credentials are required. No remote code execution is
possible through this vulnerability. Libreswan automatically restarts when
it crashes.
Workaround
- ----------
There is no workaround. Either upgrade or use the supplied patch in the
above listed resource URL.
Credits
- ---------
This vulnerability was found by The Libreswan Team.
About libreswan (https://libreswan.org/)
- ----------------------------------------
Libreswan is a free implementation of the Internet Protocol Security
(IPsec) suite and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols. It is a
descendant (fork) of openswan 2.6.38.
IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide both authentication and
encryption services. These services allow you to build secure tunnels
through untrusted networks. Everything passing through the untrusted
network is encrypted by the IPsec gateway machine, and decrypted by
the gateway at the other end of the tunnel. The resulting tunnel is a
virtual private network (VPN).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

Updated libreswan packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
add several enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Libreswan is an implementation of IPsec & IKE for Linux. IPsec is the
Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide both
authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to build
secure tunnels through untrusted networks such as virtual private network
(VPN).

A flaw was discovered in the way Libreswan's IKE daemon processed IKE KE
payloads. A remote attacker could send specially crafted IKE payload with a
KE payload of g^x=0 that, when processed, would lead to a denial of service
(daemon crash). (CVE-2015-3240)

This issue was discovered by Paul Wouters of Red Hat.

Note: Please note that when upgrading from an earlier version of Libreswan,
the existing CA certificates in the /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/ directory and the
existing certificate revocation list (CRL) files from the
/etc/ipsec.d/crls/ directory are automatically imported into the NSS
database. Once completed, these directories are no longer used by
Libreswan. To install new CA certificates or new CRLS, the certutil and
crlutil commands must be used to import these directly into the Network
Security Services (NSS) database.

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* This update adds support for RFC 7383 IKEv2 Fragmentation, RFC 7619 Auth

Null and ID Null, INVALID\_KE renegotiation, CRL and OCSP support via NSS,
AES\_CTR and AES\_GCM support for IKEv2, CAVS testing for FIPS compliance.

In addition, this update enforces FIPS algorithms restrictions in FIPS
mode, and runs Composite Application Validation System (CAVS) testing for
FIPS compliance during package build. A new Cryptographic Algorithm
Validation Program (CAVP) binary can be used to re-run the CAVS tests at
any time. Regardless of FIPS mode, the pluto daemon runs RFC test vectors
for various algorithms.

Furthermore, compiling on all architectures now enables the "-Werror" GCC
option, which enhances the security by making all warnings into errors.
(BZ#1263346)

* This update also fixes several memory leaks and introduces a sub-second

packet retransmit option. (BZ#1268773)

* This update improves migration support from Openswan to Libreswan.

Specifically, all Openswan options that can take a time value without a
suffix are now supported, and several new keywords for use in the
/etc/ipsec.conf file have been introduced. See the relevant man pages for
details. (BZ#1268775)

* With this update, loopback support via the "loopback=" option has been

deprecated. (BZ#1270673)

All Libreswan users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
