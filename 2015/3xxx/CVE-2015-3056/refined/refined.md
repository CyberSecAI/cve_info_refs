Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3056:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat Reader handles Line Annotations. A specially crafted Line Annotation can cause the reader to access memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability allows an attacker to read memory outside the bounds of an allocated object.
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds read leads to memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF files: An attacker can embed the crafted Line Annotation in a malicious PDF document.
- Malicious web pages: An attacker could potentially host a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF document or convince the victim to visit a malicious website hosting the exploit.
- User interaction is required, as the victim needs to open the malicious file or visit the malicious web page.
