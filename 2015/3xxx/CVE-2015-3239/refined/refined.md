  "cveId": "CVE-2015-3239",
  "description": "An off-by-one array indexing error was found in the libunwind API, which could cause an error when reading untrusted binaries or dwarf debug info data.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "An off-by-one error in the `dwarf_to_unw_regnum()` macro when accessing the `dwarf_to_unw_regnum_map` array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check",
      "Off-by-one error"
    ],
    "impact": "Could cause an error when reading untrusted binaries or DWARF debug information. Although, Red Hat stated that their products do not call the API in this way, and it is unlikely that any exploitable attack vector exists.",
    "attackVector": "An attacker could potentially provide specially crafted DWARF debug information or untrusted binaries that trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to supply the vulnerable application with untrusted binaries or specially crafted DWARF debug information."
