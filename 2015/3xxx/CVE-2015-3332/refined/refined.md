Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-3332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete backport of a fix related to memory charging in the TCP `connect()` function. Specifically, commit `355a901e6cf1` ("tcp: make connect() mem charging friendly") was backported into stable Linux kernel branches between 3.10.y and 3.16.7-ckt, inclusive. This backport introduced an issue in how the TCP Fast Open feature handled GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) segment counts. The backported change used an open-coded copy which did not copy `skb_shared_info::gso_segs` value, leaving it set to 0 in the new skb.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Backport:** The backported change in `tcp_send_syn_data()` did not include a necessary step of updating the GSO segment count (`skb_shared_info::gso_segs`) when copying a socket buffer (skb).
*   **Incorrect GSO Segment Count:**  The GSO segment count in the `skb_shared_info` structure was not being copied when using TCP Fast Open, leading to a zero value.
*   **Kernel BUG:** The `tcp_transmit_skb()` function incorrectly assumed that the `gso_segs` counter would always be greater than zero, and when TCP Fast Open was enabled it resulted in `tcp_skb_pcount(skb) == 0`, triggering a `BUG()` in the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS):** A local, unprivileged user could trigger a kernel panic (system crash). When TCP Fast Open is enabled, it can lead to a crash/reboot.
*   **Process context BUG():** In some cases, the BUG() could fire in the process context, killing the current process instead of crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the affected system.
*   **TCP Fast Open:** The vulnerability is triggered specifically through the use of TCP Fast Open.
*   **Enabling TCP Fast Open:** The user or an application needs to explicitly enable TCP Fast Open to exploit this vulnerability, since it was not enabled by default prior to 3.13, and it's disabled by default in many applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged local user:** A regular local user with the ability to enable TCP Fast Open, possibly through a specific application (e.g., Chrome with the correct flag enabled).
*   **No remote access needed:** The attack is local and does not require remote network access.
*   **No special privileges:** No root or administrator privileges are necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Kernel Versions:** The vulnerability affected stable branches of the Linux kernel between 3.10.y and 3.16.7-ckt. Linux kernel 3.18 and above are not affected because GSO segment count is stored and copied via the `tcp_skb_cb::tcp_gso_segs` member in newer kernel branches.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling TCP Fast Open using `sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=0` could mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Fix:**  The fix sets `skb_shared_info::gso_segs` to the correct value of `1`.
