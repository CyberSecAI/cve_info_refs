## Analysis of CVE-2015-3887

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an untrusted search path issue in ProxyChains-NG. Specifically, the `proxychains4` executable, when launching a program, sets the current working directory (`.`) as the first place to search for the `libproxychains4.so` library via `LD_PRELOAD`. This allows a malicious actor to place a crafted shared library in the same directory from which `proxychains4` is executed. This malicious library is then loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path:** The primary weakness is that `proxychains4` includes the current directory in the library search path, making it vulnerable to a malicious shared object in an attacker-controlled location.
*   **`LD_PRELOAD` Manipulation:** Proxychains uses `LD_PRELOAD` to inject its library into other processes, and this functionality is exploited to load the malicious library.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious `libproxychains4.so` in a directory and tricking a user into executing `proxychains4` from that directory. This malicious library would then be loaded into the target process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker's malicious library can contain code that executes arbitrary commands on the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** This is a local vulnerability and requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
*   **Malicious Shared Object:** The attacker crafts a malicious `libproxychains4.so` file to be loaded by the target program through `proxychains4`.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to execute `proxychains4` from a directory containing the attacker's malicious library.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where ProxyChains-NG is installed.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write files to the file system, specifically creating the malicious `libproxychains4.so` library.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into running the `proxychains4` command from the directory containing the malicious library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 4.9
*   The fix implemented in version 4.9 includes a compile-time flag `-DSUPER_SECURE` (or `--ignore-cve=no`) that removes the current working directory from the library search path, mitigating the vulnerability.
*   The github commit `9ab7dbe` specifically addresses the vulnerability by adding the SUPER_SECURE flag.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry 1147013 details the process of addressing this CVE in Fedora, with a fix included in `proxychains-ng-4.8.1-8.fc21`
*   The issue was initially reported on the oss-security mailing list and assigned CVE-2015-3887.

**In summary:** CVE-2015-3887 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in ProxyChains-NG caused by the program including the current directory in its library search path. A local attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious library in a directory and tricking a user into executing `proxychains4` from that directory, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the userâ€™s privileges. The vulnerability was addressed by removing the current working directory from the library search path by default.
