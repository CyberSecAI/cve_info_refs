 ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions in DYNAMICALLY LINKED programs via a preloaded DLL (dlsym(), LD\_PRELOAD) and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies. It supports TCP only (no UDP/ICMP etc).
 The way it works is basically a HACK; so it is possible that it doesn't work with your program, especially when it's a script, or starts  numerous processes like background daemons or uses dlopen() to load "modules" (bug in glibc dynlinker). It should work with simple compiled (C/C++) dynamically linked programs though.
 If your program doesn't work with proxychains, consider using an  iptables based solution instead; this is much more robust.
 Supported Platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* ATTENTION \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
 this program can be used to circumvent censorship. doing so can be VERY DANGEROUS in certain countries.
 ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT PROXYCHAINS WORKS AS EXPECTED BEFORE USING IT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.
 this involves both the program and the proxy that you're going to use.
 for example, you can connect to some "what is my ip" service like ifconfig.me to make sure that it's not using your real ip.
 ONLY USE PROXYCHAINS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
 THE AUTHORS AND MAINTAINERS OF PROXYCHAINS DO NOT TAKE ANY  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ABUSE OR MISUSE OF THIS SOFTWARE AND  THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES.
\*\*\* Installation \*\*\*
 # needs a working C compiler, preferably gcc ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc make [optional] sudo make install [optional] sudo make install-config (installs proxychains.conf)
 if you dont install, you can use proxychains from the build directory like this: ./proxychains4 -f src/proxychains.conf telnet google.com 80
Changelog:----------Version 4.9- fix a security issue CVE-2015-3887- add sendto hook to handle MSG\_FASTOPEN flag- replace problematic hostentdb with hostsreader- fix compilation on OpenBSD (although doesn't work there)
Version 4.8.1:- fix regression in 4.8 install-config Makefile target
Version 4.8:- fix for odd cornercase where getaddrinfo was used with AI\_NUMERICHOST to test for a numeric ip instead of resolving it (fixes nmap).- allow usage with programs that rely on LD\_PRELOAD themselves- reject wrong entries in config file- print version number on startup
Version 4.7:- new round\_robin chaintype by crass.- fix bug with lazy allocation when GCC constructor was not used.- new configure flag --fat-binary to create a "fat" binary/library on OS X- return EBADF rather than EINTR in close hook.  it's legal for a program to retry close() calls when they receive EINTR, which could cause an infinite loop, as seen in chromium.
Version 4.6:- some cosmetic fixes to Makefile, fix a bug when non-numeric ip was used as proxy server address.
Version 4.5:- hook close() to prevent OpenSSH from messing with internal infrastructure. this caused ssh client to segfault when proxified.
Version 4.4:- FreeBSD port- fixes some installation issues on Debian and Mac.
Version 4.3:- fixes programs that do dns-lookups in child processes (fork()ed), like irssi. to achieve this, support for compilation without pthreads was sacrified.- fixes thread safety for gethostent() calls.- improved DNS handling speed, since hostent db is cached.
Version 4.2:- fixes compilation issues with ubuntu 12.04 toolchain- fixes segfault in rare codepath
Version 4.1 - support for mac os x (all archs)- all internal functions are threadsafe when compiled with -DTHREAD\_SAFE  (default).
Version 4.0- replaced dnsresolver script (which required a dynamically linked "dig"  binary to be present) with remote DNS lookup. this speeds up any operation involving DNS, as the old script had to use TCP. additionally it allows to use .onion urls when used with TOR.- removed broken autoconf build system with a simple Makefile. there's a ./configure script though for convenience. it also adds support for a config file passed via command line switches/ environment variables.
Version 3.0- support for DNS resolving through proxy  supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers. Auth-types: socks - "user/pass" , http - "basic".
When to use it ?1) When the only way to get "outside" from your LAN is through proxy server.2) To get out from behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing ports.3) To use two (or more) proxies in chain: like: your\_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target\_host4) To "proxify" some program with no proxy support built-in (like telnet)5) Access intranet from outside via proxy.6) To use DNS behind proxy.7) To access hidden tor onion services.
Some cool features:
\* This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain like: your\_host <-->socks5 <--> http <--> socks4 <--> target\_host\* Different chaining options supported random order from the list ( user defined length of chain ). exact order (as they appear in the list ) dynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)\* You can use it with most TCP client applications, possibly even network  scanners, as long as they use standard libc functionality. pcap based scanning does not work.\* You can use it with servers, like squid, sendmail, or whatever.\* DNS resolving through proxy.
Configuration:--------------
proxychains looks for config file in following order:1) file listed in environment variable PROXYCHAINS\_CONF\_FILE or provided as a -f argument to proxychains script or binary.2) ./proxychains.conf3) $(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf4) $(sysconfdir)/proxychains.conf \*\*
\*\* usually /etc/proxychains.conf
Usage Example:
 $ proxychains telnet targethost.com
in this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies)specified by proxychains.conf
Usage Example:
 $ proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf targethost2.com
in this example it will use different configuration file then proxychains.conf to connect to targethost2.com host.
Usage Example:
 $ proxyresolv targethost.com
in this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies)specified by proxychains.conf

ProxyChains NG hooks network-related (TCP only) libc functions in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DSO (dynamic shared object) and redirects the connections through one or more SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies. Since Proxy Chains NG relies on the dynamic linker, statically linked binaries are not supported.

When you use fedora-review, you need to manually complete the review template, i.e. if there is a empty box like "[ ]", you need to manually evaluate whether this is not applicable, correct or not correct.

In such cases, just moving it to application-specific directory (so that such .so file is not to be used as a _library_) is enough.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1147013#c35)  Mamoru TASAKA    2015-03-16 05:47:55 UTC  ``` s/dlopen()ed/dlopen()ed or preloaded/   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1147013#c36)  Mamoru TASAKA    2015-03-16 05:51:46 UTC  ``` Well,  anyway the current version_so.patch is wrong and breaks /usr/bin/proxyresolv4 functionality because it says:  -------------------------------------------------      17 export LD_PRELOAD=libproxychains4.so      18 dig $1 @$DNS_SERVER +tcp | awk '/A.?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]/{print $5;}' -------------------------------------------------  but the module name is changed to libproxychains4.so.X, so libproxychains4.so cannot be preloaded.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1147013#c37)  Michael Schwendt    2015-03-16 12:09:46 UTC  ``` > <https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng/issues/46>  That request is difficult to understand. It doesn't explain *why* a version is requested, and it doesn't explain what "such problems" refers to. An unversioned shared lib is not a problem. Unless it changes ABI often, in which case automatic dependencies on the unversioned lib soname would be very weak.  It is also wrong to claim "unversioned so file which usually goes in -dev, -devel packages". There is no such thing as "usually" for .so files. It really depends on *how* (and when) such .so files (or symlinks) are used: [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Devel_Packages](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging%3AGuidelines#Devel_Packages)  Versioning shared libs does not solve any problem related to -devel packages. For example, imagine you had multiple versions of a library. You still could not have two non-versioned .so symlinks in the -devel packages, because they would conflict with eachother by pointing at different link targets. Another solution for that would be needed (such as hiding files from default search paths).   > move libproxychains4.so to some application-private directory > (like %_libdir/%name or so)  That would move it outside runtime linker's search path. Stuff like LD_PRELOAD=libproxychains4.so would fail and would need to be patched to add the full path. Not good if it were not done by upstream.  [...]  IMHO, there is nothing wrong with keeping libproxychains4.so in %_libdir.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1147013#c38)  Mamoru TASAKA    2015-03-16 12:20:34 UTC  ``` So what I am saying is that libproxychains4.so should be go away from %_libdir and go to application specific directory not to unneededly pollute system-wide %_libdir and patch accordingly, unless this .so is meant to be used by other application.   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=1147013#c39)  Pranav Kant    2015-03-16 13:39:37 UTC  ``` Thanks for your valuable comments.  I have removed the .so versioning now since the fedora package guidelines recommends versioning only on usable libraries, and this is not a library.
