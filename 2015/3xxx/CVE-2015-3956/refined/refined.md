- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of data authenticity. The device accepts drug libraries, firmware updates, pump commands, and unauthorized configuration changes from unauthenticated devices on the host network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device does not properly verify the authenticity of data it receives, allowing unauthenticated devices on the host network to send malicious updates or commands. The device listens on ports 20/FTP, 23/TELNET, 80/HTTP, 443/HTTPS, and 5000/UPNP, increasing the attack surface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify the device's behavior through malicious updates or commands, potentially impacting the core functions of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks from unauthenticated devices on the same host network as the vulnerable devices. The vulnerability can be exploited over various ports including FTP, TELNET, HTTP, HTTPS, and UPNP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to send malicious data.
