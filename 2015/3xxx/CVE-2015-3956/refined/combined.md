ICS Advisory
# Hospira Plum A+ and Symbiq Infusion Systems Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-161-01

## OVERVIEW

Independent researcher Billy Rios has identified vulnerabilities in Hospira’s Plum A+ Infusion System that are similar to vulnerabilities identified in Hospira’s LifeCare PCA Infusion System discussed in advisory, ICSA-15-125-01B Hospira LifeCare PCA Infusion System Vulnerabilities. Hospira identified vulnerabilities in the Symbiq Infusion System. Kyle Kamke of Ramparts, LLC has identified an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Hospira’s Symbiq Infusion System. NCCIC/ICS-CERT is reporting on these vulnerabilities to notify healthcare providers of a coordinated disclosure of vulnerability information and to provide additional defensive measures to help mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities. Hospira is releasing the Plum 360 Infusion System, a new version of Plum A+.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target some of these vulnerabilities are known to be publicly available.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Hospira products are affected:

* Plum A+ Infusion System, Version 13.4 and prior versions,
* Plum A+3 Infusion System, Version 13.6 and prior versions, and
* Symbiq Infusion System,As previously announced by Hospira in 2013, the Symbiq Infusion System was retired by Hospira on May 31, 2015 and will be fully removed from the market by December 2015. According to Hospira, during a recent service visit, the remaining Symbiq Infusion Systems have had Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET closed. Version 3.13 and prior versions.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, in a worst case scenario, may allow an attacker to impact the core functions of the device.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Hospira is a US-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world.

The affected products, the Plum A+ Infusion System (which includes Plum A+ and the Plum A+3 Infusion System), are intravenous pumps that deliver medication to patients. The affected products are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health Sector. Hospira estimates that these products are used worldwide.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

## MITIGATION

Hospira is communicating with customers to direct them to close Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET on the affected devices. In addition, Hospira is also releasing its Plum 360 Infusion System. Hospira asserts that the Plum 360 uses a different architecture than the Plum A+ Infusion System and is not vulnerable to the reported vulnerabilities.

For additional information about the vulnerabilities and compensating measures, contact Hospira’s technical support at 1-800-241-4002.

ICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners to perform a risk assessment by examining their specific clinical use of the affected products in their host environment to identify any potential impacts of the identified vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT offers the following compensating options:

* Temporarily disconnect the affected product from the wireless network until unused ports on the device are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET. Once the unused ports have been closed, reconnecting the affected device to the wireless network should be done after ensuring that the host network is isolated from the Internet. The affected product should be isolated from untrusted systems; traffic to the device should be selectively controlled and monitored for anomalous activity.
* Disconnect the affected product from the wireless network and use a wired connection to the host network. The operational concerns associated with this option are primarily associated with the initial setup of the wired connection and verifying that the host network effectively implements good design practices prior to connection of the affected product.
* If neither of the previous two options are feasible, then disconnect the affected product from the wireless network until mitigations are available. Disconnecting the affected product from the wireless network will have operational impacts. Disconnecting the device will require drug libraries to be updated manually and data normally transmitted to MedNet from the device, will not be available. Manual updates to each pump can be labor intensive and prone to entry error.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to implement the following defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. Specifically, users should:

* **Ensure that unused ports are closed, to include Port 20/FTP and Port 23/TELNET.**
* Hospira strongly recommends that healthcare providers change the default password used to access Port 8443.
* Monitor and log all network traffic attempting to reach the affected product via Port 20/FTP, Port 23/TELNET and Port 8443.
* Use good design practices that include network segmentation. Use DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems to identify anomalous activity. Use the static nature of these isolated environments to look for anomalous activities.
* Maintain layered physical and logical security to implement [defense-in-depth security practices](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) for environments operating medical devices.
* Isolate all medical devices from the Internet and untrusted systems.
* Produce an MD5 checksum of key files to identify any unauthorized changes.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
