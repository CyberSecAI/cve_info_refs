  "cveId": "CVE-2015-3259",
  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the xl command line utility in Xen 4.1.x through 4.5.x allows local guest administrators to gain privileges via a long configuration argument.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The xl command line utility mishandles long configuration values when passed as command line arguments, leading to a buffer overrun.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A semi-trusted guest administrator or controller, who is intended to be able to partially control the configuration settings for a domain, can escalate their privileges to that of the whole host.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Passing long configuration values as command-line arguments to the 'xl' utility."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a semi-trusted guest administrator or controller, who is able to provide untrusted configuration settings to the 'xl' command line.",
    "affectedSystems": "Systems built on top of xl which pass laundered or checked (but otherwise untrusted) configuration values onto xl's command line, without restricting their length, are vulnerable. The vulnerability exists on x86 and ARM and was introduced in Xen 4.1 and affects all subsequent Xen releases."
    ,
    "mitigation": "Limiting the length of untrusted configuration settings will avoid the vulnerability. (The total length of all command-line configuration settings, including some interposed newlines and trailing nul, must be less than 1024.)"
