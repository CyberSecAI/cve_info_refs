  "CVE-2015-3988": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack dashboard (horizon) handling of metadata. Potentially untrusted data was displayed from OpenStack Image service (glance) images, OpenStack Compute (nova) flavors, or host aggregates without correct sanitization. The flaw could be used by an authenticated user to conduct an XSS attack.",
    "affected_components": [
      "OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Horizon dashboard was not sanitizing metadata labels allowing malicious HTML code to be injected.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
     "impact": "An authenticated user could inject malicious javascript in metadata that, when viewed by a different (admin) user, could lead to a privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An authenticated user sets malicious metadata on Glance images, Nova flavors, or Host Aggregates which is then viewed by an admin user."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "An authenticated user account in Openstack is required.",
        "The attacker needs the ability to set metadata on Glance images, Nova flavors, or Host Aggregates.",
        "The attacker needs an administrator to view the modified metadata."
    ],
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects the update metadata page and is reproducible in versions 2014.2 through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0. The fix involves escaping HTML in metadata passed from Django."
