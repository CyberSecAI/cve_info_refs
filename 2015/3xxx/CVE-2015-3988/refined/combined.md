Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Horizon

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Persistent XSS in Horizon metadata dashboard
Reporter: Sunil Yadav (IBM)
Products: Horizon
Affects: version 2015.1.0

Description:
Sunil Yadav from IBM Security Services reported a persistent XSS in
Horizon. An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by
setting a malicious metadata to a Glance image, a Nova flavor or a Host
Aggregate and tricking an administrator to load the update metadata
page. Once executed in a legitimate context this attack may result in a
privilege escalation. All Horizon setups are affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:58:08 UTC  ``` By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability during the stack creation. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035037](attachment.cgi?id=1035037 "cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035037&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch") cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035038](attachment.cgi?id=1035038 "cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035038&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch") cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035039](attachment.cgi?id=1035039 "cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035039&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch") cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-11 04:43:01 UTC  ``` This is public now:  <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2015-010.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-11 22:31:53 UTC  ```  Created python-django-horizon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1230971](show_bug.cgi?id=1230971 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2015-3219 python-django-horizon: XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c7)  Garth Mollett    2015-06-11 22:42:39 UTC  ```  Created python-django-horizon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1230973](show_bug.cgi?id=1230973)]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c8)  Ido Ovadia    2015-06-14 14:58:02 UTC  ``` Verified ======== python-django-horizon-2015.1.0-10.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-24 20:16:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:1679 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1679.html>   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

1) Start up Horizon

2) Go to Images

3) Next to an image, pick "Update Metadata"

4) From the dropdown button, select "Update Metadata"

5) In the Custom box, enter a value with some HTML like '</script><script>alert(1)</script>//', click +

6) On the right-hand side, give it a value, like "ee"

7) Click "Save"

8) Pick "Update Metadata" for the image again, the page will fail to load, and the JavaScript console says:

SyntaxError: invalid property id

var existing\_metadata = {"

An alternative is if you change the URL to update\_metadata for the image (for example, <http://192.168.122.239/admin/images/fa62ba27-e731-4ab9-8487-f31bac355b4c/update_metadata/>), it will actually display the alert box and a bunch of junk.

I'm not sure if update\_metadata is actually a page, though... can't figure out how to get to it other than typing it in.

Looks like this same thing is possible for flavors metadata, too.

I've spent a bit of time looking at this. I can confirm the problem.

The problem is in our angular metadata widget. When item.leaf.name is used in html such as in horizon/static/angular/metadata-tree/metadata-tree-item.html it needs to be escaped. I'm not sure if that's better accomplished in the template or the js.

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/179429/> fixes the bug but introduces a new one.

With this patch, the script is not run, so this closes the vulnerability.

The field name is now displayed as "&lt;&#x2f;script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;&#x2f;script&gt;" rather than "</script><script>alert(1)</script>" as expected.

Then I tried to update the metadata with a new field "</script><script>alert(2)</script>", and the Update Image Metadata showed an error "Unable to update the image metadata.".

Thanks Brant for the detailed report!

Here is the proposed impact description, can you please confirm that only Kilo is affected and that the "update metadata" page is admin only ?

Title: Persistent XSS in Horizon image metadata dashboard

Reporter: Brant Knudson (IBM)

Products: Horizon

Affects: version 2015.1.0

Description:

Brant Knudson from IBM reported a persistent XSS in Horizon. An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by setting a malicious Glance image metadata and tricking an administrator to load the update metadata page. Once executed in a legitimate context this attack may result in a privilege escalation. All Horizon setups are affected. All Horizon setups are affected.

Thanks Brant for the detailed report!
Here is the proposed impact description, can you please confirm that only Kilo is affected and that the "update metadata" page is admin only ?

Brant Knudson from IBM reported a persistent XSS in Horizon. An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by setting a malicious Glance image metadata and tricking an administrator to load the update metadata page. Once executed in a legitimate context this attack may result in a privilege escalation. All Horizon setups are affected. All Horizon setups are affected.

For the Reporter, put "Sunil Yadav - IBM Security Services". I didn't find the problem it was a security analysis team we asked to check out Horizon.

Also, I believe that this affects not just glance metadata, but all the other things that have metadata (e.g., flavors).

I'll look into the rest of these if horizon folks don't have the time.

Thanks Brant for the feedback. So looking at \_update\_metadata.html file, it affects image, flavors and aggregates.

While playing around with the widget, something else happened.

Looks like the meta label is not properly deleted either.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Add "<script>something</script>" as meta label

2. Add "asdf" as value

3. Save

3. Go back and delete the meta data

4. Save

5. Go back, the meta data is still there

Looks like "/" character breaks the entire thing. As a result, subsequent updates to it will fail. Looking into whether this is front-end or back-end issue.

I tried recreating this on stable/juno devstack (horizon is at <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/horizon/commit/?h=stable/juno&id=db641dccb68ae3ff0bdd70dc7d60dc9605fe31c0> ) and was able to recreate with images. I wasn't able to set the metadata for a flavor to something with HTML in it, I got an error back instead. Maybe it can be done through the REST API.

It was a problem with how data was passed from Django to Angular widget. Commit above should fix this.

It's probably a good time to consider using angular modals and replacing this legacy code passing Django variables with REST endpoints.

Assuming the XSS attack risk is only to administrator accounts, that impact description looks fine. Is that page not visible to other users (perhaps to other accounts for the same tenant)?

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016

We are assigning only one CVE ID for this. Use CVE-2015-3988.

It appears that 1449260 became a public security bug on 2015-05-01 in
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/6](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1449260/comments/6) and then an
additional attack vector (Host Aggregates) was first mentioned in
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/10](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1449260/comments/10) on
2015-05-04. However, there would apparently be no reasonable way to
independently address only the attack vectors that were identified
earlier. Also, apparently the completely general description of
vectors came in from IBM (e.g., "all the other things that have
metadata" in
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/9](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1449260/comments/9) on
2015-05-04). Accordingly, it doesn't appear that an additional CVE ID
could be useful to anyone.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1679)

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix multiple security issues
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

Two security issues were discovered in the Horizon dashboard and are
addressed in this update:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Horizon Orchestration

dashboard. An attacker able to trick a Horizon user into using a malicious
template during the stack creation could use this flaw to perform an XSS
attack on that user. (CVE-2015-3219)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting the
CVE-2015-3219 issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis
as the original reporter of CVE-2015-3219.

* A flaw was discovered in the Horizon metadata dashboard whereby

potentially untrusted data was displayed from Glance images, Nova flavors,
or host aggregates without correct clean up. An attacker could use this
flaw to conduct an XSS attack.(CVE-2015-3988)

Additionally, the following non-security issues are addressed:

* It was impossible to associate a floating IP address to a port for an

instance. This occurred if the gateway router was not in the same tenant as
the instance but was attached to a network shared across tenants because
only ports within the tenant were used to find reachable gateway routers.
(BZ#1187992)

* If two or more regions were configured in Horizon, then the User, Help,

and Current Project links would no longer work and the region selector
was in the wrong location in the UI. (BZ#1189887)

* A load balancer monitor was erroneously displayed as associated with

every tenant in every pool. The load balancer monitor was not actually
associated with any tenants, but the improper display prevented users
from using the Horizon dashboard to create a tenant association.
(BZ#1196249)

* When logging into the Horizon dashboard, Horizon sends a query to Nova to

update usage statistics. One of the calls would erroneously query deleted
virtual machines; if there were thousands of deleted virtual machines, the
CPU usage for Nova would spike and the Nova process could crash.
(BZ#1243301)

* The network profile was not supported by Cisco N1KV ML2 drivers. This

profile has been removed to maintain Horizon compatibility with the Cisco
driver. (BZ#1246690)

* A neutron attribute extension was renamed from profile\_id to profile for

networks and ports. This caused create operations for networks and ports to
fail from the dashboard since the dashboard was still using the attribute
name n1kv:profile\_id rather than n1kv:profile.(BZ#1248367)

* If a virtual machine instance failed to launch, then the stale port

assignments were left in the configuration rather than being cleaned up.
(BZ#1249228)

All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
