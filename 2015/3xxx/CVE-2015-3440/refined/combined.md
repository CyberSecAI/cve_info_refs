# WordPress 4.2 stored XSS

---

*From*: Jouko Pynnonen <jouko () iki fi>

*Date*: Sun, 26 Apr 2015 23:13:31 +0300

---

```
*Overview*
Current versions of WordPress are vulnerable to a stored XSS. An
unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript in WordPress comments. The
script is triggered when the comment is viewed.

If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the
attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the
server via the plugin and theme editors.

Alternatively the attacker could change the administrator’s password,
create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently
logged-in administrator can do on the target system.

*Details*
If the comment text is long enough, it will be truncated when inserted in
the database. The MySQL TEXT type size limit is 64 kilobytes so the comment
has to be quite long.

The truncation results in malformed HTML generated on the page. The
attacker can supply any attributes in the allowed HTML tags, in the same
way as the previous stored XSS vulnerabilities affecting WordPress.

The vulnerability bears a similarity to the one reported by Cedric Van
Bockhaven in 2014 (patched this week, after 14 months). Instead of using an
invalid UTF-8 character to truncate the comment, this time an excessively
long comment text is used for the same effect.

In these two cases the injected JavaScript apparently can't be triggered in
the administrative Dashboard, so these exploits require getting around
comment moderation e.g. by posting one harmless comment first.

*Proof of Concept*
Enter the following as a comment:

<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source))
style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px
 AAAAAAAAAAAA [64 kb] ...'></a>

This was tested on WordPress 4.2, 4.1.2, and 4.1.1, MySQL versions 5.1.53
and 5.5.41.

*Solution*
Disable comments (Dashboard, Settings/Discussion, select as restrictive
options as possible). Do not approve any comments.

*Credits*
The vulnerability was discovered by Jouko Pynnönen of Klikki Oy.

# WordPress 4.2.1 Security Release

---

WordPress 4.2.1 is now available. This is a **critical security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

A few hours ago, the WordPress team was made aware of a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could enable commenters to compromise a site. The vulnerability was discovered by [Jouko Pynnönen](http://klikki.fi/).

WordPress 4.2.1 has begun to roll out as an automatic background update, for sites that [support](https://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/) those.

For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.1) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32311&stop_rev=32300).

[Download WordPress 4.2.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to **Dashboard → Updates** and simply click “Update Now”.

# WordPress 4.2 core stored XSS

### Overview

Current versions of WordPress are vulnerable to a stored XSS. An unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript in WordPress comments. The script is triggered when the comment is viewed.

If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server via the plugin and theme editors.

Alternatively the attacker could change the administrator’s password, create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently logged-in administrator can do on the target system.

### Details

If the comment text is long enough, it will be truncated when inserted in the database. The MySQL TEXT type size limit is 64 kilobytes, so the comment has to be quite long.

The truncation results in malformed HTML generated on the page. The attacker can supply any attributes in the allowed HTML tags, in the same way as with the two recently published stored XSS vulnerabilities affecting the WordPress core.

The vulnerability bears a similarity to the one reported by [Cedric Van Bockhaven](https://cedricvb.be/post/wordpress-stored-xss-vulnerability-4-1-2/) in 2014 (patched this week, after 14 months). Instead of using an invalid character to truncate the comment, this time an excessively long comment is used for the same effect.

In these two cases, the injected JavaScript apparently can’t be triggered in the administrative Dashboard so these exploits seem to require getting around comment moderation e.g. by posting one harmless comment first.

The [similar vulnerability](/adv/wordpress.html) released by [Klikki](https://klikki.fi/) in November 2014 could be exploited in the administrative Dashboard while the comment is still in the moderation queue. Some [exploit attempts](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/86766/is-email-from-my-wordpress-site-a-hack-or-just-a-normal-comment) of this have been recently reported in the wild.

### Proof of Concept

Enter as a comment text:

```
<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>

```

Confirmed vulnerable: WordPress 4.2, 4.1.2, 4.1.1, 3.9.3. Tested with MySQL versions 5.1.53 and 5.5.41.

### Demo

### Solution

WordPress has refused all communication attempts about our ongoing security vulnerability cases since November 2014. We have tried to reach them by email, via the national authority (CERT-FI), and via [HackerOne](http://hackerone.com/). No answer of any kind has been received since November 20, 2014. According to our knowledge, their security response team have also refused to respond to the Finnish communications regulatory authority who has tried to coordinate resolving the issues we have reported, and to staff of HackerOne, which has tried to clarify the status our open bug tickets.

To prevent exploitation, administrators should disable comments (Dashboard, Settings/Discussion, select as restrictive options as possible). Do not approve any comments.

Patch available: [WordPress 4.2.1](https://wordpress.org/news/).

### Credits

The vulnerability was discovered by Jouko Pynnönen of [Klikki Oy](https://klikki.fi).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
