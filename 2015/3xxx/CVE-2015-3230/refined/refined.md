Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a regression introduced in `389-ds-base-1.3.3.1-4`. The SSL socket was created before the cipher preferences were set. Consequently, the server didn't enforce the `nsSSL3Ciphers` preference and allowed connections using disabled ciphers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect SSL Socket Initialization:** The primary weakness is the incorrect order of operations during server initialization. The SSL socket was initialized before applying the configured cipher preferences.
*   **Failure to Enforce Cipher Preferences:** As a result of the incorrect initialization, the server failed to enforce the configured `nsSSL3Ciphers` setting, allowing connections using ciphers explicitly disabled in the configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Use of Weak Ciphers:** An attacker could potentially force the server to use weak or deprecated ciphers, such as RC4, even when they are explicitly disabled.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** Exploiting this vulnerability could compromise the confidentiality of the data transmitted over the network as weak ciphers are susceptible to various attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Connection:** An attacker could connect to the vulnerable server using a client that requests a disabled cipher suite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Initiate TLS Handshake:** The attacker must be able to initiate a TLS handshake and request the use of a specific cipher.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was discovered while trying to disable RC4 ciphers.
*   The problem was identified on a fully patched CentOS 7 system with `389-ds-base-1.3.3.1-16.el7_1.x86_64`.
*   The fix involves moving the SSL socket creation after setting the cipher preferences.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as bug 1230996 in Red Hat Bugzilla and as ticket 48194 upstream.
*   The fix was included in `389-ds-base-1.3.4.0-6.el7`.
*   The issue was a regression, as the setting worked correctly in earlier versions (`389-ds-base-libs-1.2.11.15-48.el6_6.x86_64`).
