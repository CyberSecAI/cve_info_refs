Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of a weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for generating session tokens in Trend Micro ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange (SMEX). The session tokens were observed to be numerical, consisting of only 4 or 5 digits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Session Tokens:** The core vulnerability is that the session tokens are easily guessable due to their limited length and the lack of a cryptographically strong PRNG. This allows an attacker to predict valid tokens.
*   **Insufficient Randomness:** The session tokens are not generated with sufficient randomness. The observed tokens were not sequentially generated, but the small number space and the simple numeric format made them easily brute-forceable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful attack allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the SMEX administrative interface by impersonating another user's session.
*   **Impersonation:** By guessing a valid session token, an attacker can effectively "hijack" an existing user session without needing their actual credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The attack is performed over the network by making HTTP requests to the SMEX web interface.
*   **Brute-force/Guessing:** The primary attack method is to brute-force or guess valid session tokens. Tools like Burp Intruder can be used to automate this process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SMEX web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker would benefit from having some knowledge of the target system to identify the session token and the target administrative page that would confirm if the token was valid.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically through a web proxy.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post mentions that the vulnerability was discovered in TrendMicro SMEX 10 SP2 but affects other versions as well.
*   The blog post uses a practical example of using Burp Intruder's number payload to generate and test session tokens, making the attack easy to implement.
*   The OWASP content on Session Prediction provides general background and context for this type of vulnerability.
