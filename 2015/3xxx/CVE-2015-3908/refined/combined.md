Package        : ansible
Version        : 1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3908 CVE-2015-6240 CVE-2018-10875 CVE-2019-10156
Debian Bug     : 930065

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system.

CVE-2015-3908

    A potential man-in-the-middle attack associated with insusfficient
    X.509 certificate verification.  Ansible did not verify that the
    server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
    (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
    valid certificate.

CVE-2015-6240

    A symlink attack that allows local users to escape a restricted
    environment (chroot or jail) via a symlink attack.

CVE-2018-10875

    A fix potential arbitrary code execution resulting from reading
    ansible.cfg from a world-writable current working directory.  This
    condition now causes ansible to emit a warning and ignore the
    ansible.cfg in the world-writable current working directory.

CVE-2019-10156

    Information disclosure through unexpected variable substitution.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

Subject: [CVE-2015-3908] Improper TLS Certificate Validation in Ansible

Versions of Ansible prior to 1.9.2 fail to adequately validate HTTPS certificates when using the get_url and uri modules, and when using the url and etcd lookup plugins. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks on those connections.

The fix for this problem has been released as part of Ansible 1.9.2.

The Ansible playbook below is a proof-of-concept that can be used to safely validate the incorrect behaviour:

  - name: a playbook demonstrating MITM in ansible
    hosts: 127.0.0.1
    connection: local
    tasks:
    - name: this should fail
      get_url: url=<https://kennethreitz.org/> dest="/tmp/shouldnotexist.html”

This playbook attempts to download a HTML file from a site presenting a certificate that is valid, but not for the site in question. Versions of Ansible from 1.9.2 onward correctly fail to validate the certificate, but earlier versions will download the file regardless and the playbook will successfully exit.

This patch contains wrong indentation (tabs instead of spaces), which break the python parsing.  When using the apt ppa module, ansible fails with  ========   File "/home/vagrant/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1439604546.72-242474222081658/apt_repository", line 2039     match_hostname(ssl_s.getpeercert(), self.hostname)     ^ IndentationError: unexpected indent ========  SR should be upcoming (if I figure out how) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=941863#c1)  Philipp Wagner   2015-08-15 10:37:01 UTC  ``` SR 323262 submitted with the fix ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=941863#c2)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-08-17 10:45:55 UTC  ``` note: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/323262> would have been auto-linked here, if you used bnc#xxx in the changelog without a space ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=941863#c3)  Philipp Wagner   2015-08-17 10:50:23 UTC  ``` Ah ok, I'll do it differently the next time. Thanks. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=941863#c4)  Benjamin Brunner   2015-08-18 15:54:10 UTC  ``` The security-team already started an update, removing needinfo.  Thanks! ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=941863#c5)  Lars Vogdt   2015-08-20 14:16:52 UTC  ``` Sorry for the fault: my vimrc is not really python friendly if the autodetection does not work :-/  Maintenance target got moved to project openSUSE:Maintenance:3974 containing your fix. So I hope we can close this once the patch is out.   Philipp: I hope it is ok for you to become the assignee of this bug. My feeling is that you are testing better for 13.2 ...

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=938161#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-07-15 08:58:37 UTC  ``` <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/106>  Versions of Ansible prior to 1.9.2 fail to adequately validate HTTPS certificates when using the get_url and uri  modules, and when using the url and etcd lookup plugins. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks on those connections.  The fix for this problem has been released as part of Ansible 1.9.2.  The Ansible playbook below is a proof-of-concept that can be used to safely validate the incorrect behaviour:    - name: a playbook demonstrating MITM in ansible     hosts: 127.0.0.1     connection: local     tasks:     - name: this should fail       get_url: url=<https://kennethreitz.org/> dest="/tmp/shouldnotexist.html”  This playbook attempts to download a HTML file from a site presenting a certificate that is valid, but not for the site in question. Versions of Ansible from 1.9.2 onward correctly fail to validate the certificate, but earlier versions will download the file regardless and the playbook will successfully exit.
