Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3243:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `rsyslogd` daemon, in some configurations, creates log files with world-readable permissions by default. This is due to the default `umask` settings used by the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** Log files containing sensitive information are created with permissions that allow any user on the system to read them.
*   **Fragile Umask Handling:** The current method of setting umasks during package installation relies on `logrotate` to preserve them during file rotation, which is fragile. If a file goes missing, the umask might revert to the service's default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information present in the log files (such as command lines including passwords, hostnames, usernames, access tokens, and other data), leading to potential compromise of the system. For example, the `/var/log/cron` file might expose command-line arguments, including passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Any local user on the system is able to read the affected log files. This vulnerability does not require a remote connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is present in versions of `rsyslog` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" security impact.
*   A workaround involves adding `create 0600 root root` to `/etc/logrotate.d/syslog` to ensure files are created with correct permissions when `logrotate` runs. It's also recommended to manually adjust existing log file permissions to restrict access.
*   The fix is classified as a "Bug Fix"
*   The recommended fix involves adjusting `logrotate` configuration and setting the correct permissions on affected log files.

**Mitigation:**

*  Add `create 0600 root root` to `/etc/logrotate.d/syslog`
* Manually set permissions on log files `chmod 600 /var/log/{messages,secure,maillog,spooler,cron}*`
