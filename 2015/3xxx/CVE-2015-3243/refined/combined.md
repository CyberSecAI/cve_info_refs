| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-17 15:04:01 UTC  ``` It was reported that rsyslogd creates log files world-readable, which might lead to an information disclosure.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c1)  Tomas Heinrich    2015-06-26 15:36:38 UTC  ``` I'm wondering how to go about fixing this one...  The base line is to change the default umask for newly created files. But that doesn't take care of already existing log files - logrotate recreates the file before rsyslog gets a chance to do it. I'm unconvinced we should hard reset files to the right umask in the updated package.  The current way of setting couple of umasks during packages install and relying on logrotate to always preserve them on file rotation is extremely fragile. If a file goes missing once for whatever reason, the umask is reset to the service default.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c2)  Robert Scheck    2015-06-27 20:22:11 UTC  ``` Can't we simply add "create 0600 root root" in /etc/logrotate.d/syslog, add the /var/log/cron to the %post of rsyslog and finally add a chmod 600 for the /var/log/{messages,secure,maillog,spooler,cron}* files in %post as well?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-14 02:33:54 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Please add:  create 0600 root root  to the /etc/logrotate.d/syslog file, this will ensure the file is created with permissions when logrotate runs. It is also recommended that users manually set the permissions on existing or newly installed log files in order to prevent access by untrusted users.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-14 02:36:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of rsyslog as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>. Additionally a workaround is available ([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c3](show_bug.cgi?id=1232826#c3 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2015-3243 rsyslog: some log files are created world-readable")).   ``` |  |

Basically +million ...
I've always been faintly horrified by how much of the Un*x system
configuration detail is readable by just about any user of the system,
though I accept that my opinion is compromised by my industrial
upbringing, and also that security-through-obscurity is, um .....

I queried this situation a long time ago for Debian [2] (locking down
hosts.allow caused problems), and asked similar questions of the
manufacturer's tech support personnel for both Digital Unix and HPUX -
 but in the fluffy world of Un*x, where by default the user was
considered non-adversarial (and in the case of workstations was
usually the owner of the system anyway), nobody was very interested.

Authorisation tokens are not the only relevant sensitive content -
this list knows that all kinds of data can be useful to an attacker,
but Back In The Day paranoia levels were low.

I'd really like to see this situation revisited (perhaps now is a
better moment), but clearly the codebase would need a lot of scrutiny
for potential consequent problems.

[1] No, not IBM mainframes - proper mainframes :-)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICL_VME>
Here, mandatory access control pervaded the whole system, and user
accounts were only ever given any access to a resource if they
absolutely needed it. This operating system actually achieved Common
Criteria certification (in the early '90s).

Subject: CVE-2015-3243 rsyslog: some log files are created world-readable

So /var/log/cron is world readable in RHEL7 which means the complete
command line is logged (so --password=, hostnames, etc.).

In line with this I have made the following proposed change for Fedora
(and by extensions Red Hat products):

<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Kurtseifried/secure_config_and_log_permissions>

Have secure by default permissions for configuration and log files

Proposed change

All configuration files (e.g. files in /etc/) and all log files (e.g.
files in /var/log/) must not be set world-readable unless there is a
functional reason to do so. By default, configuration files should be
chmod 600 or 0640 and log files should be chmod 0600. This is due to a
continuing number of security issues with world readable files that
contain sensitive information (e.g. passwords and access tokens or
logged usernames and commands for example).

Rationale

The number of security issues created by lax permissions on
configuration and log files has resulted in a number of security issues
exploitable by local users. E.g.:

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=configuration+file+permissions>

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=log+file+permissions>

Please note that the above lists are by no means a complete listing of
the security flaws that have resulted from lax permissions.

I would invite other distros/etc to also do this.
