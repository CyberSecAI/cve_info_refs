{
  "CVE-2015-3138": {
    "description": "The force printer in tcpdump before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `print-wb.c` file of tcpdump, specifically in how the whiteboard decoder handles certain crafted packets. Improper handling of these packets leads to out-of-bounds reads or writes during the processing of whiteboard data, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap overflow"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the tcpdump application or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote network attack via crafted network packets, or crafted pcap files.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send crafted network packets or supply a crafted .pcap file to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
