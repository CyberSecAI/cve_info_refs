{
  "CVE-2015-3221": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Neutron L2 agent passing an invalid address pair (specifically 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) to the ipset tool. The ipset tool rejects this input, leading to a crash of the L2 agent.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input validation in Neutron L2 agent",
	  "Failure to sanitize address pair inputs before passing them to ipset",
	  "Lack of error handling when ipset command fails"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by crashing the Neutron L2 agent. This can disrupt networking for other tenants/ports and prevent VM booting and security group updates on affected hosts.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves adding an allowed address pair with an invalid CIDR to a neutron port using the neutron API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify port configurations in OpenStack Neutron.",
	"Affected versions": "OpenStack Neutron versions 2014.2 through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0 are affected. Setups using IPTables firewall driver are vulnerable"
