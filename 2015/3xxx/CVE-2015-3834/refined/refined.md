The provided content is a git commit message. Let's break down the relevant parts:

*   **Commit Message:** "HDCP: buffer over flow check -- DO NOT MERGE"
*   **Bug:** 20222489
*   **Change-Id:** I3a64a5999d68ea243d187f12ec7717b7f26d93aa
*   **Cherry Picked:** from commit 532cd7b86a5fdc7b9a30a45d8ae2d16ef7660a72

Based on this information, here's the analysis:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) implementation. The commit message clearly states "buffer over flow check".
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The provided information doesn't specify the exact impact but buffer overflows can lead to a variety of issues, including:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the affected service or device.
    *   Arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed buffer, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   Information disclosure by reading memory beyond the allocated buffer.
*  **Attack vectors**: The commit message does not specify the exact attack vector. It is likely that the vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted HDCP message or data.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to send/influence the HDCP data stream, which would likely require a device that can interact with HDCP protected interfaces.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message indicates this is a check for a buffer overflow, which may have been a fix or an attempt to fix a pre-existing issue.
*   The "DO NOT MERGE" implies that this commit might not have been a completed fix and likely contained only the buffer overflow check.
*   The cherry-picked commit SHA suggests this fix was incorporated from another branch.

**Relevance to CVE-2015-3834**

Without the official description of CVE-2015-3834, we cannot verify if this commit is related to it. However, based on the commit message content, this is a strong indicator that the commit is related to a buffer overflow in the HDCP implementation. It's possible that CVE-2015-3834 refers to this very vulnerability, since Android was vulnerable to media server exploits at this time.
