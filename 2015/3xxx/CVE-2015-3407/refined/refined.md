Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from `Module::Signature`'s incorrect handling of files not listed in the `SIGNATURE` file during the verification of a CPAN module. It failed to account for, and thus ignored, the presence of such files within an extracted tarball.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Manifest Checking:** The core weakness is that the module did not verify all files extracted from a CPAN archive against the `SIGNATURE` file. It only checked files that were listed in the signature, implicitly trusting the presence of unlisted files.
*   **Unverified File Inclusion:** By ignoring files not in the `SIGNATURE` file, `Module::Signature` allowed for the inclusion of malicious or unexpected files in the extracted archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Specifically, the vulnerability allowed for the inclusion of files located in the `t/` directory of a CPAN module. These files would execute automatically during `make test`, thus enabling an attacker to run arbitrary code on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CPAN Module:** An attacker could craft a malicious CPAN module with a valid signature that includes a malicious test file in the `t/` directory, which is not listed in the `SIGNATURE` file. When a user installs this module and runs tests, the unlisted malicious test files would be executed.
*   **Compromised CPAN Mirror:** It's also feasible an attacker could modify a legitimate module on a CPAN mirror adding such files with a valid signature, affecting all the users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CPAN Module Creation/Modification:** Attackers need the ability to create or modify CPAN modules and generate valid PGP signatures for them, or compromise existing ones.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:**  The malicious module needs to be available on a CPAN mirror or through other means where it would be installed by a victim user.
