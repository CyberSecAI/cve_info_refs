      "Improper bounds checking during regular expression matching.",
        "Mishandling of group empty matches"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service, potentially arbitrary code execution if memory corruption is achieved.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted regular expression",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a malicious regex pattern to an application using the vulnerable PCRE library.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the subpattern calculation of a malformed regular expression. The stack memory could be overflowed via a crafted regular expression"
