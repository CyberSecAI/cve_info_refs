# CVE request: libinfinity did not correctly check certificates for validity

---

*From*: Philipp Kern <pkern () debian org>

*Date*: Tue, 12 May 2015 08:44:06 +0200

```
Hi,

Debian bug #783601[1] reported that Gobby - a collaborative text editor
- silently accepted expired certificates. The upstream bug report is
[2]. The bug is actually in libinfinity and the fix is available on [2].

libinfinity does support certificate pinning and hence contains the
ability to disable some checks like trusted issuer and hostname
verification. However the catch-all validity check was in the wrong
location.

Please assign a CVE ID for this.

Kind regards and thanks
Philipp Kern

## Description

[![@pkern](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42176?u=5b9b017bd0ca828a9c98b217d5941df73cc6cd61&v=4&size=48)](/pkern)[pkern](https://github.com/pkern)opened [on May 6, 2015](https://github.com/gobby/gobby/issues/61#issue-73750632)

[Debian bug #783601](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=783601) reported that gobby silently accepts expired certificates. The mentioned site has since been fixed and I'm unsure if that'd be due to pinning or if there's a genuine validation error. (But then the function in libinfinity doesn't seem to tolerate expiry not even with pinning AFAICS.) The report in full:

> At the moment the certificate of gobby.debian.net is expired (reported
>
> separately as Bug#783599) but Jessie's gobby happily establishes a full
>
> connection to it without any warning. This is a regression since Wheezy,

Package: gobby
Version: 0.5.0-4
Severity: serious
X-Debbugs-Cc: intrigeri@boum.org

Dear Maintainer,

At the moment the certificate of gobby.debian.net is expired (reported
separately as Bug#783599) but Jessie's gobby happily establishes a full
connection to it without any warning. This is a regression since Wheezy,
since it's not the case in gobby-0.5 (version 0.4.94-5), which shows a
warning stating that the certificate has expired with the option to
accept it any way.

It's strange (and perhaps relevant), but if one configures an empty file
as the "Trusted CAs" file in Jessie's gobby's security options, *then*
it lists the connection with a "certificate expired" error next to it in
the Document Browser pane. However, no prompt is shown, so it's not
possible to manually accept the expired certificate.

Cheers!
