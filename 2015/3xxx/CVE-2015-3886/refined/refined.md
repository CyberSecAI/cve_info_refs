Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an incorrect implementation of certificate validation in the `libinfinity` library. Specifically, the validity check (expiration) was not performed in the correct location in the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The library was not properly checking for expired certificates. Even if certificate pinning was used, the catch-all validity check was misplaced, which did not trigger the error when an expired certificate was encountered.
*   **Silent Acceptance of Expired Certificates:**  The library silently accepted expired certificates without issuing a warning or error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By accepting expired certificates, the application could be vulnerable to MitM attacks. An attacker could potentially present an expired (or otherwise invalid) certificate to intercept and manipulate the communication between the client and the server.
*   **Compromised Data Confidentiality and Integrity:**  Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the application and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker positioned on the network could intercept traffic between the client and server and replace a valid certificate with an expired one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Certificate:**  The attacker must be able to present an expired or otherwise invalid certificate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported in the `gobby` collaborative text editor application, which uses `libinfinity`.
*   The fix involved moving the expiration check to the correct location within the certificate validation process within `libinfinity`.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was released in `libinfinity` version 0.6.6.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2015-3886.
*   Certificate pinning was implemented and is supported, which allows disabling some checks, however the overall validity check was not performed correctly.

This detailed information is consistent with the official CVE description, and provides additional technical details regarding the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.
