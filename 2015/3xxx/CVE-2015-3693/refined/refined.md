Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3693:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a hardware issue known as "Rowhammer." This is a disturbance error in some DDR3 RAM devices, where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows due to electrical interactions between closely packed memory cells.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the physical design of the DRAM chips, where repeated activation of a memory row can disturb adjacent rows, leading to unintended bit flips. This violates the assumption that memory locations only change when written to. The vulnerability is present in systems using susceptible DDR3 RAM modules and can be triggered by repeatedly accessing memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit Rowhammer to cause bit flips in memory. This can be used to:
1.  **Escalate privileges:** By flipping bits in page table entries (PTEs), an attacker can gain write access to their own page tables, granting read/write access to all of physical memory and potentially gaining root access.
2.  **Escape sandboxes:** As demonstrated by the Native Client (NaCl) sandbox escape, bit flips in validated code can alter the behavior of the code, allowing an attacker to bypass sandbox restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Repeated Memory Accesses:** The primary attack vector involves repeatedly accessing specific memory locations (aggressor rows) to induce bit flips in adjacent (victim) rows. This is achieved by flushing the CPU cache using instructions like CLFLUSH to ensure the memory accesses are sent to the underlying DRAM.
2.  **Random Address Selection:** Attackers can randomly pick address pairs and hammer them, having a chance that they land on the same bank but different rows. This can be optimized further by using double-sided hammering which hammers both sides of a victim row instead of one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Unprivileged Code Execution:** The attacks can be performed from an unprivileged userland process.
2.  **Access to CLFLUSH Instruction (or Equivalent):** The initial exploit technique relied on the x86 CLFLUSH instruction to bypass CPU caches, though other methods (e.g., non-temporal memory accesses) might exist.
3.  **Knowledge of Memory Layout (Optional):** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the physical address mapping can improve the exploit's efficiency by allowing more targeted hammering. However, random address selection was also proven to be effective.
4. **Vulnerable Hardware:**  The target system must use vulnerable DDR3 RAM modules.

**Additional Details:**
*   The blog post details the technical background of the Rowhammer problem and how it can be exploited in practice.
*   The post also discusses mitigation strategies, such as targeted refreshes of adjacent rows, BIOS updates to increase refresh rates, and monitoring for row hammering using perf counters.
*   The post includes experimental results from testing various laptops, showing that a subset of them are vulnerable to Rowhammer.

The Apple security advisories confirm that this vulnerability exists in some DDR3 RAM and that it can lead to privilege escalation. Apple mitigated this by increasing memory refresh rates.
