Subject: CVE request: Module::Signature before 0.75 - multiple vulnerabilities

Hi there,

A new version of Module::Signature, was released to fix multiple
vulnerabilities. Module::Signature is used by most CPAN clients to
validate PAUSE GPG signature files on the CPAN mirrors and GPG signature
files inside individual Perl module tarballs.

The changelog for the 0.75 version is here:

<https://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Module-Signature>

This commit fixes three flaws:

<https://github.com/audreyt/module-signature/commit/8a9164596fa5952d4fbcde5aa1c7d1c7bc85372f>

- Module::Signature could be tricked into interpreting the unsigned
portion of a SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to faulty parsing
of the PGP signature boundaries.

- When verifying the contents of a CPAN module, Module::Signature
ignored some files in the extracted tarball that were not listed in the
signature file. This included some files in the t/ directory that would
execute automatically during "make test"

- When generating checksums from the signed manifest, Module::Signature
used two argument open() calls to read the files. This allowed embedding
arbitrary shell commands into the SIGNATURE file that would execute
during the signature verification process.

This commit fixes one more flaw:

<https://github.com/audreyt/module-signature/commit/c41e8885b862b9fce2719449bc9336f0bea658ef>

- Several modules were loaded at runtime inside the extracted module
directory. Modules like Text::Diff are not guaranteed to be available on
all platforms and could be added to a malicious module so that they
would load from the '.' path in @INC.

  far too many times during autoinstall.

  in addition to the original Digest::SHA1 backend.

* We now asks before importing the default keys,
  also suggested by Tels.

* Unknown cipher is made fatal, thanks to suggestion by Tels.

* Apply Dave Rolsky's patch to verify that author's pubkey
  is available on a keyserver. may need more work.

[Changes for 0.38 - 2004-01-01]

* Update to the newest Module::Install.

* Not using inc/SCRIPT/ anymore.

* Add "#defaults" and "^blibdirs$" to recommended MANIFEST.SKIP

  C compiler anyway.

* ExtUtils::Manifest 1.38 does not support good enough skips even
  for Makefile.PL, sigh.

[Changes for 0.33 - 2003-08-12]

* William Wentworth-Sheilds points out that META.yml is dynamic,
  which makes SIGNATURE incorrect for people without either "diff"

* Now fails gracefully all the time, including when incapable of
  connecting to the keyserver.

  for users without gnupg.

* "0E0" is now made into a constant, CANNOT_VERIFY.

* Do not die() when we absolutely can't verify.

* BZAJAC pointed out that we should add .svn to _default_skip.

[Changes for 0.28 - 2003-07-29]

* Remove Digest.pm dependency.

  have -version, thanks again to Alan Burlison.

[Changes for 0.27 - 2003-07-28]

* More punctuation cleanups in POD.

* Michael Schwern pointed out that successful tests shouldn't be noisy.

[Changes for 0.26 - 2003-07-17]

  argument, eliminating the "local $Module::Signautre::SIGNATURE" approach.

  Document pending.

* Bugfix for incorrect 'MALFORMED' response to signatures made from
  older versions of GnuPG, as reported by Tels.

[Changes for 0.18 - 2002-11-04]

* Binary files handling on win32 was broken. (Jos Boumans)

[Changes for 0.17 - 2002-10-30]

* Resolve bug report by Iain Truskett: cpansign -s should not complain
  manifest mismatch if SIGNATURE is lacking.

* Also, bail out gracefully when signing fails, instead of crippling the
  old SIGNATURE.

* MANIFEST.SKIP doc lifted from Test::Signature.

* Minor POD fixups.

[Changes for 0.16 - 2002-10-28]

* Adds AUTHORS file.

* Added connectivity probing for testing.

[Changes for 0.09 - 2002-10-12]

* Documented the package variables so they become part of APIs.

* Alternative (non-SHA1) ciphers in SIGNATUREs are now recognized.

* Added a new return value, CIPHER_UNKNOWN.

* Mention Test::Signature.

* Ditch Test::More from the sample script.

* Label tests.

[Changes for 0.09 - 2002-10-11]

* We're no longer alpha status; reflect in README.

* Incoporated a suggestion from Tels: undefining the $KeyServer
  package variable should disable automatic key-fetching.

* Include the tests from Iain.

* Tels: disable KeyServer fetching if it's undef'ed.

[Changes for 0.07 - 2002-10-11]

* Fixed our own signatures.

[Changes for 0.06 - 2002-10-10]

* Use many-arg system() instead of the one-arg form to prevent security breach.

* Iain Truskett: fixed export bug so SIGNATURE_OK is properly exported.

* Introduced global $KeyServer variable, default at 'pgp.mit.edu'.

* Suggestion from Aurthur Bergman: cpansign without arg should DWIM.

* Set a default keyserver for cpansign -v.

* Use by-name params for functions. sign(override => $bool).

[Changes for 0.05 - 2002-08-14]

* Typo correction and safety checking.

[Changes for 0.04 - 2002-08-14]

# USN-2607-1: Module::Signature vulnerabilities

12 May 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Module::Signature.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libmodule-signature-perl](/security/cves?package=libmodule-signature-perl) - module to manipulate CPAN SIGNATURE files

## Details

John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled PGP

signature boundaries. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick

Module::Signature into parsing the unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file

as the signed portion. ([CVE-2015-3406](/security/CVE-2015-3406))

John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled files

that were not listed in the SIGNATURE file. A remote attacker could use

this flaw to execute arbitrary code when tests were run. ([CVE-2015-3407](/security/CVE-2015-3407))

John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled

embedded shell commands in the SIGNATURE file. A remote attacker could use

this issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification.

([CVE-2015-3408](/security/CVE-2015-3408))

John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled module

loading. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code

during signature verification. ([CVE-2015-3409](/security/CVE-2015-3409))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [libmodule-signature-perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl)
  -
  [0.73-1ubuntu0.15.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl/0.73-1ubuntu0.15.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [libmodule-signature-perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl)
  -
  [0.73-1ubuntu0.14.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl/0.73-1ubuntu0.14.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libmodule-signature-perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl)
  -
  [0.73-1ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libmodule-signature-perl/0.73-1ubuntu0.14.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04
