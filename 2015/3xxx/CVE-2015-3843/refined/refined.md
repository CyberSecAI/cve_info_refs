Based on the provided content, it appears these code changes are related to a security vulnerability, specifically Bug 21697171, which seems to be addressed by protecting STK-related intents and commands.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause appears to be related to STK (SIM Toolkit) related intents and commands not being properly protected. This suggests a potential vulnerability where these commands could be accessed or manipulated by unauthorized applications or processes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Unprotected STK related intents: The commits mention making STK related intents protected, indicating they were previously vulnerable.
- Unprotected STK related commands: The commits explicitly state to make STK commands protected.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, but based on the context it could lead to:
- Unauthorized control of the SIM card and its functionalities.
- Potential for malicious activities by leveraging STK commands.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through:
- Sending malicious STK intents or commands from a compromised app.
- Intercepting or manipulating STK messages.
- Exploiting flaws in the STK implementation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to send intents/commands.
- The attacker may require the ability to install apps, intercept communications, or potentially gain further privileges.

**Summary**

The provided commits address a vulnerability where STK-related intents and commands were not properly protected. By adding permission requirements, the changes aim to prevent unauthorized access and control of SIM Toolkit functions. The commits suggest that prior to these changes, attackers could have potentially manipulated the STK to perform malicious actions, however the specific impact is not stated in the commit messages.
