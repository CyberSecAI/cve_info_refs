  "CVE-2015-3152": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "All provided content",
      "Match Score": 100
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The MySQL client library permitted, but did not require, the use of SSL/TLS when establishing a secure connection using the '--ssl' option. This option was treated as advisory rather than mandatory.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The '--ssl' client option in affected versions was treated as advisory instead of mandatory, failing to enforce SSL/TLS connections.",
        "The client would happily communicate over plaintext TCP if the server claimed not to support SSL, even if the client requested SSL via the '--ssl' option.",
        "Lack of default enforcement of SSL/TLS connections. Users have to actively enforce SSL/TLS connections by utilizing `MYSQL_OPT_SSL_ENFORCE` option or `--ssl-mode=REQUIRED` option.",
          "The fix in MySQL versions 5.5.49 and 5.6.30 was initially incorrect, allowing authentication over non-encrypted connection even when `ssl-mode=REQUIRED` was used."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server, allowing them to observe or inject database queries.",
        "Attack vectors": "A man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepts the initial handshake packet between the MySQL client and server, modifies it to indicate no SSL support, and then proxies traffic between the client (using plaintext) and the server (using a secure TLS connection).",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the MySQL client and server.",
         "The attacker must be capable of intercepting and modifying network packets"
      ]
    },
   "Affected Versions":[
        "MySQL <= 5.7.2",
        "MySQL Connector/C (libmysqlclient) < 6.1.3",
        "MariaDB, all versions prior to the fix",
        "Percona Server, all versions"
    ],
     "Fixed Versions":[
        "MySQL >= 5.7.3",
        "MySQL Connector/C (libmysqlclient) >= 6.1.3",
        "MariaDB 5.5.44, 10.0.20",
        "MySQL 5.5.49 and 5.6.30 with --ssl-mode=REQUIRED"
    ]
  }
