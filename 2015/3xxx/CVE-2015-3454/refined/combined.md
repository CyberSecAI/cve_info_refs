Subject: Re: CVE request - TelescopeJS Information Leakage: User BCrypt password hash post-authentication

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> TelescopeJS leaks the users BCrypt password hash in incoming websocket
> messages once the user has authenticated. Due to the fact that TelescopeJS
> is an expressjs web application, it uses the model of storing session
> information in the browsers localStorage.
>
> This means that if an attacker is able to find a single cross-site
> scripting flaw in MeteorJS, they would then be able to extract the users
> password hash from incoming websocket messages. This hash could then be
> cracked.
>
> The bcrypt hash is sent in incoming websocket messages every time the user
> object is needed by the application.
>
> This vulnerability affects TelescopeJS installations below version 0.15.

> A discussion about these issues can be found here:

In this case, it appears that a primary developer of TelescopeJS (the
person at the top of the GitHub contributors list) is indicating that
the previous behavior was unsafe:

  <https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/838#issuecomment-85762182>

Use CVE-2015-3454.

(In other cases, it is possible that an issue exploitable only after
"find a single cross-site scripting flaw" would not have a CVE ID
assigned.)

Also, as suggested by the
<https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/838#issuecomment-85734879>
comment, lack of the HTTPOnly flag is not relevant to this product. There
is no CVE ID for that HTTPOnly issue.

## Description

[![@infosec-au](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5241936?u=4072de3cabb736814bbeec8bbe9a01eb7e841c30&v=4&size=48)](/infosec-au)[infosec-au](https://github.com/infosec-au)opened [on Mar 21, 2015](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan/issues/838#issue-63357702)

Hey there,

Currently, any cross-site scripting attack can lead to the stealing of sessions since most cookies, and more importantly the cookie holding the session token is not marked as HTTPOnly.

Whilst XSS can simply lead to the controlling of the victim's browser to perform actions on his/her behalf, making the session cookie HTTPOnly, can prevent further exploitation by the attacker.
