- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple buffer overflow issues existed in `blued`'s handling of XPC messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker may be able to cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted XPC messages to `blued`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker
