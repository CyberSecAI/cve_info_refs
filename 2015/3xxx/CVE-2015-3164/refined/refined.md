Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The XWayland server, used for hosting X11 clients within a Wayland compositor session, had an authentication setup issue. Specifically, it would start in a non-authenticating mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing authentication: The XWayland server failed to properly restrict connections, allowing any client with access to the server's UNIX socket to connect without proper authentication.
- Permission bypass:  Local users could bypass intended permission restrictions on XWayland.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: Untrusted local users could connect to the XWayland server as if they were authorized clients.
- Data capture/manipulation: This unauthorized access enabled them to capture contents of and send input to other X11 clients running within the XWayland session, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
- Potential for sensitive data leakage from other X11 applications.
- Modification of the state of other X11 applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability was exploitable by any local user who had access to the XWayland server's UNIX socket.
- No remote exploitation was considered possible as Wayland compositors did not start XWayland with TCP access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system where XWayland was running.
- Ability to access the XWayland server's UNIX socket.
- No authentication or special privileges needed to exploit this vulnerability once the attacker had local access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected XWayland versions introduced with X.Org Server 1.16 and later before the fix.
- The issue was resolved by restricting XWayland connections to the same UID as the server itself, which is consistent with Wayland's default security practices.
