  "CVE-2015-3118": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-416",
      "Title": "Adobe Flash AS2 - textfield.filters Use-After-Free (2)"
    },
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in how TextFilter.filters array is handled in Adobe Flash Player. When setting the TextFilter.filters array with a custom object, the 'length' property of the object can be overridden to execute AS2 code. This AS2 code can free the object being processed, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of custom objects when setting TextFilter.filters array, leading to the possibility of freeing the object during processing.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution can be achieved, potentially leading to a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted SWF file"
    ],
     "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft an SWF file with malicious AS2 code and get a user to load the SWF file in an vulnerable Flash Player version.",
    "Affected software": [
      "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.302 and 14.x through 18.x before 18.0.0.203 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.481 on Linux",
      "Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.180",
      "Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.180",
      "Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.180"
    ]
