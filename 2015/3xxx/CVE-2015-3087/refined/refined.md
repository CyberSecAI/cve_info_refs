{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in Adobe Flash Player's Function.apply method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
	  "Type confusion"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to memory corruption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious SWF files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via specially crafted SWF files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create and deliver a malicious SWF file to the victim. This could be through a malicious website or other means.",
	"additional_information": "The vulnerability lies in the `BaseExecMgr::apply` function within the Flash Player's execution engine, specifically when it calculates the size of an array of arguments to pass to a function called using `Function.apply`. A large argument count can cause an integer overflow resulting in a small buffer allocation, followed by out-of-bounds write when argument values are copied into it."
