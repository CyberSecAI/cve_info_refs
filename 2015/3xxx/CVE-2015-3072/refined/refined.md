Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ADBCAnnotEnumerator` component of Adobe Reader. This component is related to handling annotations within PDF documents.
*   By crafting a PDF with specific JavaScript instructions, an attacker could bypass intended restrictions on the Javascript API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **JavaScript API Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent security mechanisms that limit JavaScript's capabilities within the Adobe Reader environment. This indicates a flaw in how Adobe Reader manages and validates JavaScript execution contexts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This means an attacker could potentially take full control of the computer, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Document:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file. The attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code into the PDF designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim has to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page. This implies the vulnerability is not automatically triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need physical access to the victim's system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs in-depth knowledge of the `ADBCAnnotEnumerator` component and the specific JavaScript code required to bypass restrictions.
*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious PDF:** The attacker must be able to generate a PDF document that includes the exploit code.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
* Adobe released a patch to correct this vulnerability.
