Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3798:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an integer signedness/overflow in the `tre_tnfa_run_parallel` function of the OS X regex engine (TRE library). Specifically, the `total_bytes` variable is calculated as an `int` and involves the product of `num_states` and `num_tags`. These values can be manipulated through a crafted regular expression such that `total_bytes` overflows and becomes negative.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to negative value. This negative value is then used to allocate a buffer using `malloc`, and the negative `total_bytes` is then sign-extended in the `memset` call, which can result in writing to a small (or potentially zero-size) buffer or potentially triggering other issues (depending on the specific implementation details of `memset`).
*   **Impact:** The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash or unpredictable behavior caused by the buffer overflow. There is a potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can leverage the overflow to overwrite critical data structures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack vector:** Crafted regular expressions. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted regular expression to the regex engine, that results in integer overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to pass a crafted regular expression to the vulnerable regex engine, which is part of the libc library, which is a core component of the operating system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is in the `tre_tnfa_run_parallel` function:
    ```c
      int tbytes;
    ...
      if (!match_tags)
        num_tags = 0;
      else
        num_tags = tnfa->num_tags;

    ...
      {
        int rbytes, pbytes, total_bytes;
        char *tmp_buf;
        /* Compute the length of the block we need. */
        tbytes = sizeof(*tmp_tags) * num_tags;
        rbytes = sizeof(*reach_next) * (tnfa->num_states + 1);
        pbytes = sizeof(*reach_pos) * tnfa->num_states;
        total_bytes =
          (sizeof(long) - 1) * 4 /* for alignment paddings */
          + (rbytes + tbytes * tnfa->num_states) * 2 + tbytes + pbytes;

        DPRINT(("tre_tnfa_run_parallel, allocate %d bytes\n", total_bytes));
        /* Allocate the memory. */
    #ifdef TRE_USE_ALLOCA
        buf = alloca(total_bytes);
    #else /* !TRE_USE_ALLOCA */
        buf = xmalloc((unsigned)total_bytes);  <-- malloc is called, not alloca
    #endif /* !TRE_USE_ALLOCA */
        if (buf == NULL)
          return REG_ESPACE;
        memset(buf, 0, (size_t)total_bytes);
    ```
*   The `total_bytes` calculation does not properly check for integer overflow.
*   `num_states` and `num_tags` are derived from the regex complexity and can be manipulated by an attacker to cause an overflow during the `total_bytes` calculation.
*  The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to generate a regular expression that exploits this flaw.
*  The issue was fixed by improved memory handling.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
*   The issue is present in iOS and OS X as the underlying regular expression engine is shared across both.
*   The provided information provides more detail than the official CVE description.

In summary, CVE-2015-3798 is an integer overflow vulnerability in the TRE library's regex engine. An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted regex that results in a negative size when calculating buffer size.
