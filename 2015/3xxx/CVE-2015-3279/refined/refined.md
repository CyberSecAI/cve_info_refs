{
  "CVE-2015-3279": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in filter/texttopdf.c in texttopdf in cups-filters before 1.0.71 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted line size in a print job, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the texttopdf utility within cups-filters. This overflow occurs when processing print jobs with specifically crafted line sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
       "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially crash the texttopdf utility or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'lp' user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the texttopdf utility processes a print job with a crafted line size.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to submit print jobs to the system running the vulnerable version of cups-filters."
