        "text": "A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.\n\n**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**\n\nThis Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).\n\nThis Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).\n\n| CVE# | Component | Protocol | Package and/or Privilege Required | Remote Exploit without Auth.? | CVSS VERSION 2.0 RISK (see [Risk Matrix Definitions](/security-alerts/advisorymatrixglossary.html)) | | | | | | | Supported Versions Affected | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Base Score | Access Vector | Access Complexity | Authen-tication | Confiden-tiality | Integrity | Avail-ability |\n| CVE-2015-4863 | Portable Clusterware | Oracle Net | None | Yes | 10.0 | Network | Low | None | Complete | Complete | Complete | 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, 12.1.0.2 |  |\n\nThe fix also addresses CVE-2015-3183.\n",
