lib: fix races in dump directory handling code

```
Florian Weimer <fweimer@redhat.com>:

    dd_opendir() should keep a file handle (opened with O_DIRECTORY) and
    use openat() and similar functions to access files in it.

    ...

    The file system manipulation functions should guard against hard
    links (check that link count is <= 1, just as in the user coredump
    code in abrt-hook-ccpp), possibly after opening the file
    with O_PATH first to avoid side effects on open/close.

Related: #1214745

Move the code from abrt-server to shared library and fix the condition
validating dump dir's path.

As of now, abrt is allowed to process only direct sub-directories of the
dump locations.

dbus: avoid race-conditions in tests for dum dir availability

```
Florian Weimer <fweimer@redhat.com>

    dump_dir_accessible_by_uid() is fundamentally insecure because it
    opens up a classic time-of-check-time-of-use race between this
    function and and dd_opendir().
