{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2015-3192",
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Spring processes inline DTD declarations. A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted XML file that would cause out-of-memory errors when parsed.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Spring Framework"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper processing of inline DTD declarations within the Spring Framework when DTD is not entirely disabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of XML DTD declarations",
      "Insufficient resource management leading to out-of-memory errors"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by submitting a specially crafted XML file. This leads to memory consumption and out-of-memory errors, potentially crashing the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack",
      "Crafted XML input"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XML file to the vulnerable application.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to Spring Framework 3.2.14+, or 4.1.7+ or disable DTD processing completely. Also recommended to use Woodstox library for StAX parsing"
