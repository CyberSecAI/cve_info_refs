- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed when checking XPC entitlements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper checking of XPC entitlements, allowing a process to potentially gain admin privileges without proper authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A process may gain admin privileges without proper authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation would likely involve a process attempting to gain privileges by bypassing XPC entitlement checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to execute a process that could attempt to leverage the vulnerability, likely a local attacker.
