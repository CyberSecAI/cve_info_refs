Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an infinite loop in the LBMR (Load Balancing Multicast Routing) dissector within the Wireshark network protocol analyzer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The LBMR dissector in Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.4 can enter an infinite loop when processing malformed LBMR packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering the infinite loop, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially rendering it unresponsive or crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker could inject a specially crafted, malformed LBMR packet onto the network to trigger the vulnerability in a Wireshark instance capturing traffic.
- **Malicious Packet Trace File:**  An attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing a vulnerable LBMR packet, leading to the same DoS effect when Wireshark attempts to analyze the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send or deliver a malformed LBMR packet to a system running a vulnerable Wireshark version (1.12.0 - 1.12.4)
- This could be achieved by network access to the target or by sending the crafted packet as a file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark version 1.12.5.
- The vulnerability affects all platforms where Wireshark is installed.
