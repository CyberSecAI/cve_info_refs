CVE-2015-3755:
  - Root cause: A malformed URL could allow a malicious website to display an arbitrary URL, potentially leading to user interface spoofing.
  - Weaknesses: Improper URL handling.
  - Impact: User interface spoofing, where a malicious site can display a deceptive URL.
  - Attack vectors: Visiting a maliciously crafted website that uses a malformed URL.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious website.

CVE-2015-3754:
  - Root cause: The private-browsing implementation in WebKit does not prevent caching of HTTP authentication credentials.
  - Weaknesses: Improper caching of HTTP authentication credentials in private browsing mode.
  - Impact: Remote attackers could track users by revealing parts of the user's private browsing history.
  - Attack vectors: Visiting a crafted website that exploits the caching of authentication credentials.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a crafted website.

CVE-2015-3751:
  - Root cause: WebKit incorrectly handles Content Security Policy (CSP) when video controls are used with IMG elements within OBJECT elements.
  - Weaknesses:  Bypass of CSP protection mechanisms by using a video control in conjunction with an IMG element within an OBJECT element.
  - Impact: Remote attackers could bypass CSP and load images in violation of website's policies.
  - Attack vectors:  Visiting a malicious website using video controls and nested IMG/OBJECT elements.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious website.

CVE-2015-3750:
  - Root cause: WebKit does not enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for Content Security Policy (CSP) report requests.
  - Weaknesses: Lack of HSTS enforcement for CSP report requests.
  - Impact: Man-in-the-middle attackers can obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic or spoof a report.
  - Attack vectors:  Man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepts and modifies network traffic.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:  Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

CVE-2015-5804:
  - Root cause: Memory corruption in WebKit due to a crafted web site.
  - Weaknesses: Memory corruption vulnerabilities.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution or denial of service (application crash).
  - Attack vectors: Visiting a maliciously crafted web site.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious website.
