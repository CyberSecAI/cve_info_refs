**CVE-2015-3716**

*   **Root Cause:** A command injection vulnerability existed in the way Spotlight handled filenames of photos added to the local photo library.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation when processing filenames in Spotlight's photo library indexing.
*   **Impact:** Searching for a malicious file with Spotlight could lead to command injection, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
*  **Attack Vector:** A user adds a malicious file to the local photo library, then searches for it using Spotlight.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to add a specially crafted photo file to the local photo library. The attacker would need knowledge of the command injection vulnerability to craft a filename with embedded command sequences that could be executed during the Spotlight index.
