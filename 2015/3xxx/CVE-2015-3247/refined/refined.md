  "CVE-2015-3247": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the `worker_update_monitors_config` function within the spice-server.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The race condition leads to a heap-based memory corruption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious guest user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the SPICE protocol when a guest interacts with the host's monitor configuration.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a malicious user within a guest virtual machine."
