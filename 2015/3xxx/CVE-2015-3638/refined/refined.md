Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-provided values for configuration variables. Specifically, the application allows users to inject arbitrary PHP code instead of an integer value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data that is used to build a PHP configuration file, allowing for the injection of arbitrary PHP code within configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code into a configuration variable, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server when the configuration file is included by the application. This could lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of phpMyBackupPro, specifically by manipulating configuration settings.
- **Configuration Variable Injection:** The attacker injects malicious PHP code into a user configuration variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of phpMyBackupPro to modify the vulnerable configuration variables.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must identify the specific configuration variable that is vulnerable to this injection and inject malicious code into that variable.
- **Web Access:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of phpMyBackupPro to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
- In phpMyBackupPro versions prior to 2.5, users can set a configuration variable (e.g., "delete local backups after x days") to a value that is later used in a PHP include.
- The application fails to sanitize or escape the value, allowing the injection of arbitrary code.
- For instance, setting the variable to `${`touch /tmp/xyz`}` results in the execution of the `touch /tmp/xyz` shell command when the configuration file is included.
- In version 2.5, PHP variable variables are blocked but code injection is still possible by breaking out of string literals. E.g. `\');\`touch /tmp/xyz\`;//`

The provided information gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and includes specific examples. It highlights the lack of input sanitization as the core issue leading to arbitrary code execution.
