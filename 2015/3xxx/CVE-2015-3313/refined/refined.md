Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the "Community Events" WordPress plugin's search function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the plugin's search functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, including user credentials (usernames and password hashes).
*   **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided content, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often be leveraged for data modification or deletion if the database user has the necessary permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the Community Events full schedule page. Specifically, the `eventyear` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The exploit can be triggered by manipulating the `eventyear` parameter in the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   No specific authentication is required, as this is a blind SQL injection vulnerability, and the attacker can exploit it without a valid user account.
*   The target site needs to have at least one event planned in the calendar for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*   The attacker needs to be able to analyze the responses to confirm whether the injected SQL queries are true or false.

**Technical Details and Proof of Concept:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `eventyear`.
*   A sample vulnerable request to the Community Events full schedule page is provided:
    `http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&eventyear=2015 AND 1=1 )--&dateset=on&eventday=1`
*   A request that confirms the blind SQL injection:
    `http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&eventyear=2015 AND 1=0 )--&dateset=on&eventday=1` (This will likely return a blank page due to the logic of the SQL query)
*   The `sqlmap` command is provided as an example of how to automate the exploit:
    ```sql
    sqlmap -u "http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&eventyear=2015&dateset=on&eventday=1" -p "eventyear" --technique=B --dbms=mysql --suffix=")--" --string="Test" --sql-query="select user_login,user_pass from wp_users"
    ```
*   The parameter `--string="Test"` is used so the tool can differentiate between true and false statements, and this string should match a part of an existing event's name.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Community Events plugin versions 1.3.5 and earlier are affected.

**Fixed Version:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4 of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that the CVSS Base Score is 7.5, further emphasizing the severity of this vulnerability.
