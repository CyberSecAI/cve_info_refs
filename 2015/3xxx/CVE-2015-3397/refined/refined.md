{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper HTML encoding of JSON data when used within HTML contexts. Specifically, using `Json::encode()` directly within `<script>` tags can expose IE6/IE7 users to XSS attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities, affecting users of IE6/IE7 browsers.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves injecting malicious javascript code within JSON data rendered in HTML pages. This is specifically exploitable in older browsers like IE6/IE7 because of their way of interpreting the HTML.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or inject data that is later rendered as JSON within a script tag on a webpage."
