- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path element within Schneider Electric's Wonderware System Platform applications (Wonderware InTouch, Application Server, Historian, and SuiteLink). The applications use a fixed search path to load DLLs at runtime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of a fixed, uncontrolled search path. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it, thus enabling arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. This could have a wide range of impacts, such as data theft, system disruption, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a local user being tricked into loading and executing a malicious DLL by placing it in the fixed search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to place the malicious DLL in the appropriate location. Social engineering may be needed to convince a local user to run a vulnerable application.
