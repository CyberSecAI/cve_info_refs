# RHSA-2017:3115 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R5 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that ResourceServlet in Spring Framework does not sanitize the paths that have been provided properly. An attacker can utilize this flaw to conduct directory traversal attacks. (CVE-2016-9878)
* A vulnerability was discovered in Apache Thrift client libraries that allows remote, authenticated attackers to cause an infinite recursion via vectors involving the skip function, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. (CVE-2015-3254)
* A vulnerability was discovered in JSch that allows a malicious sftp server to force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get. An attacker could leverage this to write files outside the client's download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client process. (CVE-2016-5725)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

Installation instructions are located in the download section of the customer portal.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

RHSA-2017:2477 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2017:2477 - Security Advisory

* [概述](#overview)

## 概述

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 7 security update

## 类型/严重性

Security Advisory: Important

## 标题

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 7 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)
* A vulnerability was discovered in Apache Thrift client libraries that allows remote, authenticated attackers to cause an infinite recursion via vectors involving the skip function; resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. (CVE-2015-3254)
* A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in ZooKeeper which allows an attacker to dramatically increase CPU utilization by abusing "wchp/wchc" commands, leading to the server being unable to serve legitimate requests. (CVE-2017-5637)

Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525.

## 解决方案

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).
