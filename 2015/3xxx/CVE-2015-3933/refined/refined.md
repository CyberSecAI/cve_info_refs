Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `register.php` file within the GeniXCMS application. Specifically, the `email` and `userid` parameters are directly inserted into SQL queries without sufficient validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be injected via the `email` and `userid` parameters within the registration process. The `is_email` and `is_exist` functions in `\inc\lib\User.class.php` are vulnerable because they directly embed user-supplied input into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Data modification: Altering or deleting existing data.
    *   Privilege escalation: Possibly gaining administrative access to the system, depending on the database user's privileges.
    *   Denial of service: Disrupting the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `register.php` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code into the `email` or `userid` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required as this vulnerability is in the user registration process.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of payloads, demonstrating how an attacker could extract database information.
*   The Github commit message indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in the `v0.0.3-patch` release. The commit message also credits `cfreer` for reporting the vulnerability.
