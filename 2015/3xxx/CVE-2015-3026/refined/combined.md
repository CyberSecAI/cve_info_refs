Subject: icecast2: icecast can be remotely killed by anyone if using
<authentication type="url"> and stream\_auth option
Date: Wed, 8 Apr 2015 07:59:15 +0200
```
Package: icecast2
Version: 2.4.0-1.1
Severity: important

icecast can be killed by anyone with a simple HTTP request when
<authentication type="url"> is used and a stream_auth handler is
defined.

Example configuration:

<mount>
  <mount-name>/test</mount-name>
  <authentication type="url">
    <option name="stream_auth" value="[http://127.0.0.1/bla"/](http://127.0.0.1/bla%22/)>
  </authentication>
</mount>

(Note: It does not matter where the URL for stream_auth points to,
if it is reachable or not. Actually icecast dies before even
accessing that URL.)

Given the above configuration anyone can now easily kill icecast
by this command:

wget <http://<servername>:8000/admin/killsource?mount=/test>

This only happens when making a request WITHOUT login credentials.

I'm marking this bug important but it might justify a higher
severity. With this security problem the package appears unfit
for release.

Rücker <thomas@ruecker.fi> Reply-To:     oss-security@lists.openwall.com To:     oss-security@lists.openwall.com   A new version of Icecast was released, following the discovery of a remote denial of service vulnerability by Juliane Holzt earlier today.  Affected Icecast versions: 2.3.3(first release with stream_auth) 2.4.0 2.4.1  Fix released in: 2.4.2  We do not release fixes for: 2.3.3: EOL 2.4.0: not necessary, as 2.4.1 was a bugfix release for 2.4.0.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

[Resending, as Thunderbird/Enigmail broke the GPG signature]
Today we became aware of a bug in the Icecast code handling source
client URL-authentication and are releasing a security fix.
The bug was discovered by Juliane Holzt, who we'd like to thank for
bringing this to our attention and providing us with further details.

Affected Icecast versions:
2.3.3(first release with stream_auth)
2.4.0
2.4.1

Fix released in:
2.4.2

We do not release fixes for:
2.3.3: EOL
2.4.0: as 2.4.1 was a bugfix release for 2.4.0.

The bug can only be triggered if "stream_auth" is being used, for example:
<mount>
  <mount-name>/test.ogg</mount-name>
  <authentication type="url">
    <option name="stream_auth" value="[http://localhost/auth"/](http://localhost/auth%22/)>
  </authentication>
</mount>

This means, that all installations that use a default configuration are
NOT affected.The default configuration only uses <source-password>.
Neither are simple mountpoints affected that use <password>.

A workaround, if installing an updated package is not possible, is to
disable "stream_auth"and use <password> instead.

As far as we understand the bug only leads to a simple remote denial of
service. The underlying issue is a null pointer dereference. For
clarity: No remote code execution should be possible, server just segfaults.

Proof of concept:
curl "<http://example.org:8000/admin/killsource?mount=/test.ogg">
If the server is configured as above, then it will segfault.A source
client does not need to be connected to that mount point.
As Juliane points out: "This only happens when making a request WITHOUT
login credentials."
This means, that sadly exploiting this does not require any
authentication, just the knowledge of a mount point configured with
stream_auth.

As usual there are up to date packages available for most mainstream
distributions. We've moved from my personal project to an official
Xiph.org project on openSUSE OBS:
[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/multimedia:xiph/icecast](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/multimedia%3Axiph/icecast)
Individual repositories are here:

A copy of the openSUSE OBS multimedia signing key is here:
<http://icecast.org/multimedia-obs.key>

The Windows version will be updated later today.

Known issues (as in 2.4.1)
    * status-json.xsl format differs if one source client is
      connected and if more than one client is connected.
      Workaround: e.g. connect dummy source(s).
    * HTTP PUT implementation currently doesnâsupport
      chunked encoding yet.
    * HTTP PUT with âpect: 100-Continueâeceives first a â0ând
      soon after a â0âinstead of the â0ât end of transmission.
    * Caution should be exercised when using <on-connect> or
      <on-disconnect>, as there is a small chance of stream file
      descriptors being mixed up with script file descriptors, if the
      FD numbers go above 1024. This will be further addressed in the
      next Icecast release.
    * Donâuse comments inside <http-headers> as it will prevent
      processing of further <header> tags.
    * Web interface shows Login when using just stream_auth.

We are requesting a CVE ID through oss-security and I will update the
ticket once we have received it.

PS: The OBS package builds are somewhat slow today, so it might still
take a while until the last updated packages have been published to the
repositories. I didn't want to delay the release announcement further.

Subject: CVE Request for Icecast 2.3.3, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, fixed in 2.4.2

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

A new version of Icecast was released, following the discovery of a
remote denial of service vulnerability by Juliane Holzt earlier today.

Affected Icecast versions:
2.3.3(first release with stream_auth)
2.4.0
2.4.1

Fix released in:
2.4.2

We do not release fixes for:
2.3.3: EOL
2.4.0: not necessary, as 2.4.1 was a bugfix release for 2.4.0.

# Icecast: Denial of service — GLSA **201508-03**

A bug in the Icecast code handling source client URL authentication
causes a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/icecast** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.2** |

### Background

Icecast is an open source alternative to shoutcast that supports mp3,
ogg (vorbis/theora) and aac streaming.

### Description

When stream\_auth handler is defined for URL authentication and a request
is sent without login credentials, a Denial of Service condition can
occur.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

Users of affected versions can change stream\_auth mountpoints to use
password authentication instead.

### Resolution

All icecast users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/icecast-2.4.2"

```

Package        : icecast2
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3026
Debian Bug     : 782120

Juliane Holzt discovered that Icecast2, a streaming media server, could
dereference a NULL pointer when URL authentication is configured and the
stream_auth URL is trigged by a client without setting any credentials.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.0-1.1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icecast2 packages.
