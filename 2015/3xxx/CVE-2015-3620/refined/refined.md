Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer & FortiManager web application. Specifically, the `name` and `query` parameters within the "Reports > Advanced > Dataset > View Dataset" module do not properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Non-Persistent XSS:** The vulnerability is non-persistent, meaning the malicious script is injected via the URL and executed when a user loads the crafted URL, but not stored on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly filter or encode user-supplied input in the `name` and `query` parameters.
*   **Filter Bypass:** The application's filter attempts to block script tags but can be bypassed by using `img`, `embed`, and `iframe` tags with `onload` attributes. The filter does not properly handle the context with correct encoding, allowing the code to execute in the DOM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially steal a user's session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious page.
*   **External Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to other malicious sites.
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary client-side scripts within the user's browser.
*   **Web Module Context Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially alter the behavior or appearance of web modules within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **GET Request:** The vulnerable parameters are accessible via GET requests.
*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers construct specially crafted URLs containing malicious scripts injected into the vulnerable parameters (`name` and `query`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Fortinet appliance web interface.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious crafted URL.
*   **No Privileged Account Required:** Exploitation does not require a high-privileged account to exploit.

**Affected Products & Versions**
*   FortiManager 5.2.0 GA, 5.2.1 GA
*   FortiManager 5.0.3 GA to 5.0.10 GA release
*   FortiAnalyzer 5.0.0 GA to 5.2.1 GA release
*   Affected Version(s): 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.0.3 to 5.0.10 & 5.0.0 to 5.21 (GA)

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) exploit, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be triggered using `iframe` and `img` tags.
* The fix involves secure parsing and encoding of vulnerable input fields, restricting special characters and encoding the output to prevent script execution.
*   The security risk is assessed as medium with a CVSS score of 3.5.
