- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA GPU kernel-level driver for FreeBSD does not properly sanitize pointers from user space before dereferencing them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary memory read/write in kernel space, leading to denial of service, data leaks, data corruption, privilege escalation, and arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker must influence the value of pointers passed to the NVIDIA kernel module via /dev/nvidia\* device nodes. Requires local user access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires permission to access the /dev/nvidia\* device nodes and the ability to run code as a local user.
