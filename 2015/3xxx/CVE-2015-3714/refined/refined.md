- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Apps using custom resource rules may have been susceptible to tampering that would not invalidate the signature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource validation allowed tampered applications to bypass signature checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Tampered applications could be launched without detection.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious modification of application resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify application resources before the signature is validated.
