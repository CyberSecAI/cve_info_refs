Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-3884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation and sanitization in the qdPM application, specifically within file upload functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper restrictions on file types. This means an attacker can upload malicious files, including PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and then accessing a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full compromise of the system.
- **Data Breach:** Once the attacker gains control of the system, they can access sensitive information, modify data or even bring the system down.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the application's web interface, specifically through the following:
    - User avatar upload section on http://website.com/qdPM/index.php/myAccount
    - Any of the attachment upload sections on various pages such as projects, tasks, tickets, discussions, reports, and scheduler.
- The file names of uploaded files will have a random number prepended to them e.g., http://website.com/qdPM/uploads/users/248743-shell.php, and attachments will be located at http://website.com/qdPM/uploads/attachments/

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be a user with the ability to upload files to the system either using the avatar upload or an attachment option in any of the vulnerable pages.

**Additional details:**
- The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including the specific paths vulnerable, the rand number generation for prepended file names, and the affected application qdPM version 8.3.
