Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `external_format_text()` function in Moodle's web services. This function is responsible for cleaning and formatting text before it's displayed. The issue is that it doesn't properly sanitize text when it's being returned to external applications via web services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a potential XSS risk. If a user inputs text containing malicious JavaScript (XSS payload), this text is correctly cleaned when displayed within the Moodle website. However, when this same text is passed to external applications via web services, it might be displayed *without* proper sanitization, leading to XSS execution in the external app.
- **Incorrect Text Formatting:** The `external_format_text()` function is cited as cleaning and formatting text incorrectly

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS in External Applications:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within external applications that consume data from Moodle web services. This could potentially lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities in the context of the external application.
- **Data Corruption:** The incorrectly sanitized or formatted text could corrupt data within the external application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Services:** The primary attack vector is through Moodle's web services. An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into a text field within Moodle that is then accessed via the web services.
- **Input Text:** Attackers would insert the XSS payloads as part of input text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Moodle Account:** An attacker needs a Moodle account that allows them to input text.
- **XSS-UnTrusted User:**  The attack is focused on users who are not considered 'XSS-trusted'.
- **External Application Access:**  The attacker must understand how data is consumed from the web services by the external application.
