Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3155:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly references "CVE-2015-3155 - The \_session\_id cookie is issued without the Secure flag". This confirms its relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is the absence of the "Secure" flag in the `_session_id` cookie issued by the Foreman application.
   - The `_session_id` cookie is generated when a user accesses the application over HTTPS.
   -  The issue was also present on "timezone" and "_ForemanSelectedhosts" cookies

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Missing Secure Flag:** The `_session_id` cookie lacks the "Secure" flag.
   - This flag prevents the browser from sending the cookie over unencrypted HTTP connections
   - Other cookies (`timezone`, `_ForemanSelectedhosts`) also lacked the secure flag, although they had negligible impact from a leak.
 
**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Session Hijacking:** Without the "Secure" flag, the `_session_id` cookie can be intercepted by an attacker if the user accesses the application through an unencrypted HTTP connection.
   - The attacker could then use this stolen session ID to impersonate the victim, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the Foreman system.
  - For the 'timezone' and 'ForemanSelectedhosts' cookies, the impact was deemed "negligible" for a leak. However, an attacker intercepting a HTTP response and setting different values for them could cause minor inconvenience.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept the user's network traffic when the user accesses an HTTP URL within the scope of the cookie.
   -  **HTTP Link Induction:** An attacker might induce the user to visit a non-secure HTTP link, causing the session cookie to be transmitted over an insecure connection. This can be done directly or by embedding the link on another website.
   -  Since Foreman redirects from HTTP to HTTPS an attacker might need to try and trick a user to visit the HTTP site after a successful authenticated HTTPS session.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Monitoring:** The attacker must have the ability to monitor or intercept network traffic between the user and the Foreman server.
   - **Induce User Action:** The attacker needs to induce the user to visit an HTTP url.
