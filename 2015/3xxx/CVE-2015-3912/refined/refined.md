Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Huawei E355s Mobile WiFi device has an information disclosure vulnerability where an attacker can obtain configuration and user information without logging in. This is due to the lack of proper access control on the device's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Information Disclosure:** The device leaks sensitive information such as configuration and user details.
* **Missing Authentication:** Attackers do not need to authenticate to the web interface to access this information.
* **Insecure command execution:** The vulnerability allows grafting attack commands without login, indicating a lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** An attacker can obtain configuration details and user information. This may include credentials for accessing the device, network settings, and potentially other sensitive data.
* **Device Compromise:** By obtaining configuration information, an attacker can further compromise the device and potentially gain unauthorized access to the network the device is connected to.
* **Network Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the network the device is connected to and/or intercept network communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the E355s device is present.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the device's web interface by grafting attack commands and analyzing the response, or capturing the network data packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable E355s device. This could be a local network or a network with public accessibility of the web interface.
*   **Technical Skill:** The attacker needs the ability to use tools to craft attack commands and analyze network traffic.
