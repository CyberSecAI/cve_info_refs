## Description

[![@gnilrets](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2371577?v=4&size=48)](/gnilrets)[gnilrets](https://github.com/gnilrets)opened [on Jan 12, 2015](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/issues/349#issue-54124268)

I was wondering if there was a good way to hide the login password from the log? Alternatively, could we disable logging for certain actions (like log in)?
