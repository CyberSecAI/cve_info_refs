Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3008:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Asterisk handles null bytes within the Common Name (CN) field of X.509 certificates during TLS connections. Specifically, Asterisk does not properly validate the length of the common name, allowing a crafted certificate to bypass validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** Asterisk fails to verify that the length of the certificate's common name matches what it actually reads.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of a null byte (`\x00`) within the CN field, allowing a malicious actor to include an arbitrary string after the expected domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** This vulnerability allows a MitM attacker to impersonate a legitimate SSL server. By crafting a malicious certificate with a null byte, an attacker can make Asterisk connect to their server while believing it is communicating with the intended destination.
*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can effectively spoof arbitrary SSL servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack occurs over the network when Asterisk attempts to establish a TLS connection to a SIP server. The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate the TLS handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MitM Position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the Asterisk server and the legitimate SIP TLS server.
*   **Certificate Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious X.509 certificate that contains a null byte in the CN field after the expected domain name, and have it signed by a legitimate certificate authority (CA).

**More Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability occurs during the registration of a SIP TLS device where the asterisk server verifies the identity of the connecting server using the CN field of the presented X.509 certificate.
* If the presented certificate's CN field contains a null byte after the expected domain, asterisk will accept the certificate as valid.
* For example, if asterisk expects to connect to `www.domain.com` a certificate with a CN field of `www.domain.com\x00www.someotherdomain.com` will be accepted.

**Affected Versions:**

*   **Asterisk Open Source:** Versions 1.8.x, 11.x, 12.x, and 13.x before the corrected versions.
*   **Certified Asterisk:** Versions 1.8.28, 11.6, and 13.1 before the corrected versions.

**Patched Versions:**

*   **Asterisk Open Source:** 1.8.32.3, 11.17.1, 12.8.2 and 13.3.2
*   **Certified Asterisk:** 1.8.28-cert5, 11.6-cert11, and 13.1-cert2

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is resolved by patching asterisk to check that the length of the CN field in the certificate matches what asterisk is actually expecting. The fix disallows certificates that contain null bytes in the CN field.
