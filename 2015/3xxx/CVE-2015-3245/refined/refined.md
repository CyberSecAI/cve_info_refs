```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- CVE-2015-3245: The `chfn` function of the `userhelper` utility did not properly filter out newline characters, allowing injection into `/etc/passwd`.
- CVE-2015-3246: The `libuser` library directly modified `/etc/passwd` instead of using a temporary copy, leading to potential inconsistencies if modifications failed.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- CVE-2015-3245: Insufficient input validation, specifically not filtering newline characters in GECOS fields.
- CVE-2015-3246: Insecure direct modification of the `/etc/passwd` file.

Impact of exploitation:
- CVE-2015-3245: Local denial of service by corrupting the `/etc/passwd` file.
- CVE-2015-3246: Local denial of service due to an inconsistent `/etc/passwd` and potential privilege escalation to root when combined with CVE-2015-3245.

Attack vectors:
- CVE-2015-3245: A local attacker with shell access could use the `chfn` function of the `userhelper` utility to inject newline characters into the `/etc/passwd` file.
- CVE-2015-3246: A local attacker with shell access could use applications linked with `libuser` (such as `userhelper`) to trigger inconsistent states while modifying the `/etc/passwd` file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user with shell access and the ability to execute programs like `userhelper` or `chfn` and a valid account listed in /etc/passwd, along with its password.

Additional details:
- The Qualys advisory outlines a sophisticated exploit using RLIMIT_FSIZE to interrupt `write()` calls to the `/etc/passwd` file, along with race conditions and other techniques, to leverage CVE-2015-3246.
- The Metasploit module implements this exploit by inserting a new user with UID=0 in /etc/passwd.
- Mitigation steps include restricting access to `chfn` and `chsh` via PAM configurations or updating the libuser package.
