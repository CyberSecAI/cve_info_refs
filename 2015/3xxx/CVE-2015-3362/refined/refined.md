The provided content is a mailing list thread discussing CVE requests for multiple Drupal contributed modules, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities discovered in January 2015. CVE-2015-3362 is not mentioned in the email thread. However, based on the email, SA-CONTRIB-2015-032, Node Invite, had an open redirect vulnerability, and this was the replacement for SA-CONTRIB-2015-031, GD Infinite Scroll, which had an open redirect vulnerability.

- Users can be redirected to a malicious website that may attempt to steal credentials, install malware, or engage in phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URLs with malicious redirect targets within the Node Invite module.
