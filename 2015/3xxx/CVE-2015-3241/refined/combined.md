Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1898)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute instance
migration process. Because the migration process does not terminate
when an instance is deleted, an authenticated user could bypass
user quota and deplete all available disk space by repeatedly re-sizing
and deleting an instance. (CVE-2015-3241)

A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute handled the resize
state. If an authenticated user deleted an instance while it was in the
resize state, it could cause the original instance to not be deleted from
the compute node it was running on, allowing the user to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2015-3280)

Note: CVE-2015-3241 was already addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 7.0 in a previous release.

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin of Webzilla LTD as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-3241, and George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD
and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc. as the original reporters of
CVE-2015-3280.

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1723)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) instance
migration process. Because the migration process does not terminate when an
instance is deleted, an authenticated user could bypass user quota and
deplete all available disk space by repeatedly re-sizing and deleting an
instance. (CVE-2015-3241)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin of Webzilla LTD as the
original reporter.

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

Before installing an update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to the system have been applied.

To access updates when using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, launch the graphical update tool through **Applications** and then **Software** which is visible in the Favorites dock (by default).

```
# gnome-software

```

Within the graphical interface, select **Updates**.

For a command line interface, use the following command to update the operating system:

```
# dnf upgrade

```

To install a specific package, such as vsftpd, use the following command:

```
# dnf install vsftpd

```

To update a specific package, such as bind, use the following command:

```
# dnf upgrade bind

```

To find more information about the command line options available for `yum`, use the following command:

```
# man dnf

### Bug Description

If user create instance, and resize it to larger flavor and than delete that instance, migration process does not stop. This allow user to repeat operation many times, causing overload to affected compute nodes over user quota.

Affected installation: most drastic effect happens on 'raw-disk' instances without live migration. Whole raw disk (full size of the flavor) is copied during migration.

If user delete instance it does not terminate rsync/scp keeping disk backing file opened regardless of removal by nova compute.

Because rsync/scp of large disks is rather slow, it gives malicious user enough time to repeat that operation few hundred times, causing disk space depletion on compute nodes, huge impact on management network and so on.

Proposed solution: abort migration (kill rsync/scp) as soon, as instance is deleted.

Affected installation: Havana, Icehouse, probably Juno (not tested).

Thanks for the report! The OSSA tasks is set to incomplete pending project core security review.

At first glance, it's seems a valid DoS avenue...

Yes, we might want to issue a single OSSA for both, if a patch can be logged for this one soon enough.

Looks like a real issue. Priority set to high just to show it's behind existing issues.

Is the proposed solution (abort migration (kill rsync/scp) as soon as instance is deleted) somethign that works for everyone ? Anyone up for proposing a patch that would do that ?

For me it works in manual mode (go to node and kill all scp/rsyncs in sight). Because this bugreport is private, most of the tenants do not know about this and that happens mostly with my own machines in lab.

There is no patch up to now. Sorry, I'm operator, it's too deep and complicated for me.

Fix in the <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1392527> is working on destination host (as far as I understand), but scp or rsync should be killed on the source host.

In the resize operation, during copying files from source to destination compute node scp/rsync processes are not aborted after the instance is deleted because linux kernel doesn't delete instance files physically until all processes using the file handle is closed completely. Hence rsync/scp process keeps on running until it transfers 100% of file data.

One way to abort rsync/scp process is to call truncate command and set the size of the file to 0 bytes before deleting the instance files in the delete operation. We have added code to truncate files to 0 bytes and found out that it aborts rsync/scp process and doesn't copy the file to the destination node.

Previously rsync/scp copies 100% of file data but after adding truncate command, if the instance is deleted during copying files using rsync process it raises following ProcessExecutionError

ProcessExecutionError: Unexpected error while running command.

Also timing wise, we have observed rsync/scp processes are aborted early as compared to copying 100% of file but unfortunately the difference is not that big, it's merely 10-15% gain in time.

Hello. Seems cool, but is this documented feature of rsync? If this a random bug/undocumented behaviour, relying on it to close CVE is too fragile.

And one more, please check the codepath with scp too. I just tried to truncate file on the source (and destination) hosts and this does not terminate scp. It actually hangs it.

Steps:

fallocate big -l 10G

scp big remote\_server: &

truncate big --size 0

ssh remote\_server truncate big --size 0

and scp fall down to '-stalled-' mode.

Hi,

Attached is the Truncate patch which Tushar Patil has referred in comment #8.

@George,

We have tried with scp process as well. In case of SCP with this attached patch processing time of copying file is less but it copies the disk file to destination node where as in case of rsync it does not copies the disk file to destination node.

It does not work with scp. I've rechecked it twice on different systems: if you truncate source file for scp, it still continue to copy data. It displays '-stalled-' state, but network activity is very high for very long time after the file was truncated.

Try yourself:

fallocate big -l 10G

scp big remote\_server: &

truncate big --size 0

Check network interface load (atop utility, for example) right after that script. It will be very high until copy is not finished.

In our installation we specifically disable rsync to force nova to use scp, because scp with proper crypto settings is much faster than rsync for raw disk (they should be copied as is at full size and rsync smart tricks with scanning just makes thinks slower).

I really like to see fix for scp.

In my opinion it should just send SIGHUP to scp (or rsync).

Proper solution would be to store PID of the process during call in nova/common/processutils.py, but it would be a very serious change (not the best idea for bugfix).

For very dirty trick (but not more dirty than utils.exec('truncate')) one can use 'fuser -k /path/to/file'. It will terminate \_ANY\_ process accessing file. And I think it is right behavior, because no one should access file during instance termination.

P.S. And there should be fallback from 'fuser' to 'truncate' in case if fuser is not installed on the host.

I have confirmed there is an issue with scp. Also I agree with the solution you have mentioned in comment #13, it would fix this issue for both scp and rsync. We will submit a patch with this proposed solution soon.

I opened question on stackoverflow: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29494852/force-application-to-close-fd-or-cause-eio-linux>

Right now there is one concern: If we are sending kill -9 to all application accessing file ('fuser -k' sends kill -9), can we by some chance to send it to nova-compute or libvirtd?

Some scenarios:

1) Concurrent calls 'create snapshot' and 'delete' from user

2) libvirtd performing scheduled tasks on image

May be we should not call fuser, but do the same (search in /proc/PID/fd) and try to narrow application list to 'scp' and 'rsync'?

I know it sounds paranoid, but I don't want to see random kill -9 on production on unspecified process list.

Hi,

I have attached patches which will kill the rsync/scp processes if instance is deleted while resizing.

1. oslo\_concurrency patch, to store the pid of the process - 0001-Store-pid-of-processes.patch

2. nova patch, to pass a callback handler to store/remove the pid and kill the process - 0001-Kill-rsync-scp-processes-before-deleting-instance.patch

To run this patch successfully on master you need to apply following patches to avoid the nova-compute startup issue:

1. <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/173794/1>

2. <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/173897/>

Note:

1. In attached nova patch I have used os.kill() to kill the process, this can also be done by using process\_utils execute call.

2. If rsync/scp process is killed while deleting the instance, instance folder remains on destination node.

   If you apply periodic patch [1] mentioned in security bug [2] the above orphan instance folder gets deleted on nova-compute startup

Current state of play:

173794 is merged, 173897 is abandoned in favour of the merged 174288.

0001-Store-pid-of-processes.patch looks good to me, but should probably be a gerrit review with a more generic commit message. We need to release oslo.concurrency before we can use this in nova. This presents a problem as well, as I don't think we bump the dependancies for stable releases?

0001-Kill-rsync-scp-processes-before-deleting-instance.patch looks reasonable to me too.

In theory oslo.concurrency has a corresponding stable branch where they would backport the necessary functionality, and then tag a corresponding stable point release which either matches the current caps in stable requirements or in such a way that we can adjust that requirement to only cover the new stable release of the library.

We proposed to issue a single advisory for this issue and #1392527 which are similar in term of impact. However, in case this bug couldn't be fixed at the same time, we might want to issue a different advisory (in order to not block one because of the other). Here is the impact description draft:

Title: Nova instance migration process does not stop when instance is deleted

Reporter: George Shuklin (Webzilla LTD)

Products: Nova

Affects: versions through 2014.1.4, and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and version 2015.1.0

Description:

George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD reported a vulnerability in Nova migration process. By resizing and deleting an instance repeatedly an authenticated user may overcome his quota and overload Nova computes node resulting in a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

Hi All,

For stable/kilo oslo.concurrency required version is >=1.8.0,<1.9.0, so is it possible to release a new version 1.8.1 with the required changes in oslo.concurrency to fix this security issue.

For stable/juno oslo.concurrency is not used, instead changes need to be done in processutils module of oslo-incubator.

Is it possible to propose a separate patch for stable/juno by making changes in oslo-incubator processutils module?

Please let me know your opinion for the same.

Yes, in theory we could update nova stable/juno from a fix on the stable/juno branch of oslo-incubator.

I subscribed Dims as the oslo PTL to get his advice on the oslo portions.

I've uploaded: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190472/>

Once that lands in master I'll follow the appropriate process to get that added to kilo and juno. as outlined in comments 22 and 23

Hi,

Oslo concurrency patch is merged <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/190472> today and I have made changes in nova patches for handling 2 callbacks.

Should I attach the patch to bug or submit it to gerrit as this bug is already marked as public.

Please suggest.

libvirt: Kill rsync/scp processes before deleting instance

In the resize operation, during copying files from source to

    destination compute node scp/rsync processes are not aborted after

    the instance is deleted because linux kernel doesn't delete instance

    files physically until all processes using the file handle is closed

    completely. Hence rsync/scp process keeps on running until it

    transfers 100% of file data.

Added new module instancejobtracker to libvirt driver which will add,

    remove or terminate the processes running against particular instances.

    Added callback methods to execute call which will store the pid of

    scp/rsync process in cache as a key: value pair and to remove the

    pid from the cache after process completion. Process id will be used to

    kill the process if it is running while deleting the instance. Instance

    uuid is used as a key in the cache and pid will be the value.

To sum-up:

1/ Required Oslo changes:

\* Ifc23325eddb523f6449ba06a2deb0885a8a7009d: "Add 2 callbacks to processutils.execute()"

-> [oslo.concurrency] merged in master/kilo/juno

-> [oslo.incubator] \*in progress\* in juno

\* I22b2d7bde8797276f7670bc289d915dab5122481: "processutils: ensure on\_completion callback is always called"

-> [oslo.concurrency] merged in master/kilo/juno

\* Ica74dd6c35e6bd17eac285e2dc2900c1ff23073f: "Sync process utils from oslo for execute callbacks"

-> [nova] \*in progress\* for juno

2/ Requirements bump:

\* I08693891b2b4c1d4c166e41b38adc6776e25d8e5: "Nova requires concurrency 2.1.0 or better"

-> [nova] merged in master, \*patch needed\* for kilo

3/ Actual Nova fix:

\* Ie03acc00a7c904aec13c90ae6a53938d08e5e0c9: "libvirt: Kill rsync/scp processes before deleting instance"

-> [nova] merged in master, \*in progress\* for kilo, \*patch needed\* for juno

4/ What is missing:

\* The priority is the oslo.incubator change ( <https://review.openstack.org/208876> ).

\* Once this gets in, we can update the sync ( <https://review.openstack.org/209791> ).

\* Seems like the nova requirements.txt olso bump needs to be adjusted, 2.1.0 does not have the "ensure on\_completion is called" fix...

\* The kilo fix ( <https://review.openstack.org/209856> )

\* The juno fix ( should depend on the sync )

Am I missing something here ?

Hi Tristan,

Thank you for summary,

We also need \* I22b2d7bde8797276f7670bc289d915dab5122481: "processutils: ensure on\_completion callback is always called" in oslo-incubator stable/juno and then we can sync oslo-incubator stable/juno to nova stable/juno.

libvirt: Kill rsync/scp processes before deleting instance

In the resize operation, during copying files from source to

    destination compute node scp/rsync processes are not aborted after

    the instance is deleted because linux kernel doesn't delete instance

    files physically until all processes using the file handle is closed

    completely. Hence rsync/scp process keeps on running until it

    transfers 100% of file data.

Added new module instancejobtracker to libvirt driver which will add,

    remove or terminate the processes running against particular instances.

    Added callback methods to execute call which will store the pid of

    scp/rsync process in cache as a key: value pair and to remove the

    pid from the cache after process completion. Process id will be used to

    kill the process if it is running while deleting the instance. Instance

    uuid is used as a key in the cache and pid will be the value.

Conflicts:

Great, seems like all required changes are now merged.

In the upcoming OSSA ( <https://review.openstack.org/216422> ), I've only referenced the relevant bits (requirements bump and actual fix).

Thanks everyone :)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-28 12:34:54 UTC  ``` It was reported from upstream that a vulnerability was found in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.  Affected versions: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c6)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-14 23:18:16 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1263019](show_bug.cgi?id=1263019)]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c7)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-14 23:18:52 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1263020](show_bug.cgi?id=1263020 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-3280 openstack-nova: Deleting instances in resize state fails [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c10)  Matthew Booth    2015-09-18 13:53:13 UTC  ``` Please see upstream commits rather than patches attached to this bz.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c11)  Summer Long    2015-10-15 00:30:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack upstream project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc. as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-15 12:31:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 7 For RHEL 7   OpenStack 5 for RHEL 6   OpenStack 5 for RHEL 7   OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:1898 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1898.html>   ``` |  |
