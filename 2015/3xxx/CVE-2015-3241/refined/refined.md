{
  "CVE-2015-3241": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenStack Compute (nova) instance migration process does not terminate when an instance is deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service vulnerability due to the migration process not stopping when an instance is deleted."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can bypass user quota and deplete all available disk space by repeatedly re-sizing and deleting an instance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the resize and delete operations of OpenStack Compute instances."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated access to OpenStack Compute."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs during the migration process of OpenStack Compute instances. When a user resizes an instance to a larger flavor and then deletes it, the migration process does not stop. This allows a malicious user to repeatedly perform this action, leading to a denial of service by depleting disk space on the compute node. The rsync/scp processes continue to operate, keeping disk files open even after instance deletion. The issue is more severe with raw-disk instances where entire disks are copied during migration."
