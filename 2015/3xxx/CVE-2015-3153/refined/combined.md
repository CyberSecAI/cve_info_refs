# USN-2591-1: curl vulnerabilities

30 April 2015

Several security issues were fixed in curl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Paras Sethia discovered that curl could incorrectly re-use NTLM HTTP

credentials when subsequently connecting to the same host over HTTP.

([CVE-2015-3143](/security/CVE-2015-3143))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled zero-length host names.

If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted

host name, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3144](/security/CVE-2015-3144))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookie path elements.

If a user or automated system were tricked into parsing a specially crafted

cookie, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3145](/security/CVE-2015-3145))

Isaac Boukris discovered that when using Negotiate authenticated

connections, curl could incorrectly authenticate the entire connection and

not just specific HTTP requests. ([CVE-2015-3148](/security/CVE-2015-3148))

Yehezkel Horowitz and Oren Souroujon discovered that curl sent HTTP headers

both to servers and proxies by default, contrary to expectations. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. ([CVE-2015-3153](/security/CVE-2015-3153))

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3153
Debian Bug     :

It was discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, if configured to
use a proxy server with the HTTPS protocol, by default could send to the
proxy the same HTTP headers it sends to the destination server, possibly
leaking sensitive information.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed in
version 7.42.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.42.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
