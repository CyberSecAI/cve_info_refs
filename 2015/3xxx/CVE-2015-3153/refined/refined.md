Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the default behavior of `curl` and `libcurl` when using a proxy server with the HTTPS protocol.
- By default, `curl` sends all HTTP headers, including custom ones, to both the proxy server and the destination server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage**: Sending HTTP headers to the proxy server can expose sensitive information contained within those headers.
- The vulnerability exists when using a proxy with the HTTPS protocol

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious proxy server could intercept and read sensitive data present in HTTP headers intended only for the destination server.
- This could lead to the compromise of confidential user information, such as authentication tokens, API keys, or other sensitive data that may be present in headers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, as it requires a client to connect to a malicious proxy server via HTTPS.
- An attacker would need to control or have compromised a proxy server that is used by the `curl` client.
- The `curl` client does not need to be tricked to use a specific proxy, as this is the default behaviour of `curl`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a network position that allows them to intercept the HTTP traffic between a client and a destination server.
- The attacker needs to control or have compromised an HTTPS proxy server used by the `curl` client.
- No specific client-side action is needed by the victim for exploitation other than using curl with the default settings for a proxy.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was resolved in `curl` version 7.42.1.
- Several Linux distributions released security updates to address this issue, including Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE.
- Apple also addressed this vulnerability in their security update for OS X Yosemite.
- The vulnerability is considered a moderate severity issue due to the potential for information disclosure.
