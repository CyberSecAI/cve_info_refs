Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that Apache Ambari allows authenticated cluster operator users to input arbitrary text as a note when saving configuration changes. This note field is then rendered without proper HTML escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. Because the note field is rendered as-is, a malicious user can inject JavaScript code within the note field that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the note.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the user interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Ambari UI where authenticated users can add notes.
- The attacker would need to be an authenticated cluster operator user to be able to add configuration notes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within Apache Ambari, with permissions to save configuration changes and input notes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Ambari version 2.1.0 by properly HTML-escaping the note field.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Important".
