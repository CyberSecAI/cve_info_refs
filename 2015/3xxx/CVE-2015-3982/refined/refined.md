- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the `cached_db` session backend in Django 1.8. When `session.flush()` was called, it mistakenly set the session key to an empty string (`''`) instead of `None`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The empty string was treated as a valid session key, leading to all users with an empty session cookie using the same session store.
- **Impact of exploitation:** When a user logged into a different account without logging out, the session was flushed (setting the key to `''`). The new account details were then set on this shared session. This meant any other user with an empty session cookie would now be logged into that account, leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** This is a server-side vulnerability where an attacker doesn't require direct network access to exploit, but rather needs a user to log in to a different account without logging out, after having previously logged into the application. The attacker would only need to have an empty session cookie value for the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have visited the application at least once and have an empty string as the value of their session cookie. Once this condition is met, and another user logs in to a different account without logging out, the attacker will gain access to the new user's session.
