  "CVE-2015-3092": {
    "Description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172 do not properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3091.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper restriction of memory address discovery.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper restriction of memory address discovery leading to ASLR bypass"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Bypass of ASLR protection mechanism, potentially leading to easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Unspecified vectors"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted SWF file. No authentication is required."
