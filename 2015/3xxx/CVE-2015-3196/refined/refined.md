{
  "CVE-2015-3196": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in OpenSSL when handling Pre-Shared Key (PSK) identity hints in a multi-threaded client. The PSK identity hints are incorrectly updated in the parent SSL_CTX structure leading to a double free.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Race condition",
      "Double free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing a multi-threaded SSL/TLS client using OpenSSL.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker by sending malicious requests to a multi-threaded SSL/TLS client using OpenSSL that trigger the vulnerable code path.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted ServerKeyExchange message containing PSK identity hints to a vulnerable multi-threaded OpenSSL client."
