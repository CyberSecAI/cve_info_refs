Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-3256:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from memory corruption issues within the JavaScript interpreter used by polkit, specifically during the evaluation of JavaScript rules. The code did not properly manage JavaScript objects, leading to various memory corruption issues.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of JavaScript objects in memory, leading to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution. Specifically, there were issues with unrooted `jsval` storage on the heap, which resulted in a use-after-free condition
*   **Uninitialized Parameters:** Passing uninitialized parameters to JavaScript functions caused memory corruption issues.
*   **Memory Leaks:** Multiple memory leaks were identified and resolved, including a per-authorization leak and a leak during authentication agent registration.
*   **Use of potentially outdated SpiderMonkey:** Code was not build to properly prevent builds against older SpiderMonkey engines, that did not have the necessary code to prevent issues, which leads to memory corruption.
*   **Improper GC Handling**: The code was not properly handling garbage collection (GC) in combination with usage of the JavaScript Interpreter, leading to memory corruption and race conditions.
*  **Missing callback clearing**: The JS operation callback was not cleared, causing crashes during javascript execution.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A local, unprivileged attacker can cause polkitd to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  Memory corruption could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the `polkitd` daemon. Exploitation could also allow an attacker to bypass polkit policies and gain root access to the machine.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to send D-Bus messages.
*   **D-Bus Messages:**  The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious D-Bus requests to polkitd. This can be done by unprivileged users as the D-Bus is accessible. 

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **D-Bus Access:** The attacker needs the capability to send D-Bus messages. The attacker does not need special polkit status.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The documents mention multiple patches to address this vulnerability, including those related to uninitialized parameters, object rooting on the heap, and wrapping JavaScript usage within requests.
*   The fix for CVE-2015-3256 was part of a larger update that also addressed other vulnerabilities and bugs in polkit.
*   SUSE considers this issue to have a "moderate" severity.

The provided content highlights several key issues, which can be summarized as memory corruption and DoS via the improper use of Javascript in the polkit daemon.
