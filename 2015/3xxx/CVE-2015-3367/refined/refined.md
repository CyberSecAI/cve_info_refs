The provided content is a request for CVE IDs for multiple vulnerabilities in Drupal contributed modules. Specifically, it mentions that "SA-CONTRIB-2015-031 - GD Infinite Scroll - Open Redirect" should be discarded in favor of "SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - Open Redirect". 

However, since the CVE ID in question is CVE-2015-3367 and the content refers to "SA-CONTRIB-2015-032 - Node Invite - Open Redirect", it's likely that the content is related to a different CVE. There is no mention of the actual CVE ID (CVE-2015-3367) in the text.

Therefore, the correct response would be:

**UNRELATED**
