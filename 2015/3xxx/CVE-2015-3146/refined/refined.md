{
  "CVE-2015-3146": {
    "Root cause": "A logical error in the handling of SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY packets. A detected error did not set the session into the error state correctly and further processed the packet, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect state validation in packet handlers for SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS and SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY. Specifically, the code failed to set the session into an error state when an error was detected during processing of these packets.",
      "The state validation logic did not properly prevent further processing of the packet after an error was detected"
    ],
    "Impact": "A null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash of the server or client, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS or SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY packet sent by a MITM attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and server (MITM attack) to inject malicious packets. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability, as it occurs before the authentication phase."
