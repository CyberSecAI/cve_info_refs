## strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2015-3991)

Jun 01, 2015

A denial-of-service and potential remote code execution vulnerability triggered by crafted IKE messages was discovered in strongSwan. Versions 5.2.2 and 5.3.0 are affected.

[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)[5.3.x](/blog/tags/5.3.x)[5.2.x](/blog/tags/5.2.x)

An independent researcher privately reported a denial-of-service and possible remote code execution vulnerability in strongSwan. Affected are strongSwan versions 5.2.2 and 5.3.0.

[CVE-2015-3991](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-3991) has been assigned for this vulnerability.

The bug can be triggered by an IKEv1 or IKEv2 message that contains payloads that are only defined for the respective other IKE version. For instance, sending an IKEv1 Main Mode message containing a payload with type 41 (IKEv2 Notify) will crash the daemon when a short summary of the contents of the message is logged ("parsed ID\_PROT request 0 [... ]"). Other payload types may trigger crashes in other places.

The message/payload parser in the IKE daemon charon is shared by both IKE versions and payloads for the respective other IKE version initially were fully parsed even if they were later not used. With 5.2.2 we added a check to avoid this so that only payloads valid for the current IKE version are parsed. For invalid payloads an object of type unknown\_payload\_t is created, which previously was mainly used for IKEv2 to reject messages if the critical bit is set on payloads of unknown type.

Unfortunately, the original numeric type of the payload was retained, so when the daemon worked with received payloads later, such objects could
be treated as objects of the original type, not as instances of unknown\_payload\_t. In the example above, when the payloads in the message are logged, the type is checked and the generic pointer is casted to the expected type to get more information. In this particular case the unknown\_payload\_t object with type 41 is casted to a notify\_payload\_t object, and an attempt is made to call methods defined on that struct, causing a dereference of uninitialized memory, which might lead to remote code execution. Actually, because the unknown\_payload\_t struct is smaller than some of the structs of other payload types and a pointer to the contents of the original payload (after the generic IKE payload header) is stored in the unknown\_payload\_t object it is possible that an attacker may even directly control the code that is executed if the offset of the called function happens to align with the pointer to that content. It may also align with pointers in neighboring payloads, which, too, may point to data controlled by an attacker.

Thanks to Javantea for reporting the issue responsibly. He found it using his own [IKEv1 fuzzer](https://www.altsci.com/ipsec/ikev1_fuzzer.html).

Fix

The just released [strongSwan 5.3.1](/blog/2015/06/01/strongswan-5.3.1-released.html) fixes this vulnerability. For older releases we [provide a patch](http://download.strongswan.org/security/CVE-2015-3991/) that fixes the vulnerability and should apply with appropriate hunk offsets.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1222815#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-19 08:49:54 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the strongSwan payload handling code. This flaw can be triggered by an IKEv1 or IKEv2 message that contains payloads that are only defined for the respective other IKE version. For instance, sending an IKEv1 Main Mode message containing a payload with type 41 (IKEv2 Notify) will crash the daemon or, potentially allow for remote code execution, when a short summary of the contents of the message is logged ("parsed ID_PROT request 0 [ ... ]").   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1222815#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-19 08:52:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1027039](attachment.cgi?id=1027039 "strongswan-5.2.2-5.3.0_unknown_payload.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1027039&action=edit "strongswan-5.2.2-5.3.0_unknown_payload.patch") strongswan-5.2.2-5.3.0_unknown_payload.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1222815#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-05 20:20:40 UTC  ``` This is public:   <https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2015/06/01/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2015-3991%29.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1222815#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-05 20:21:50 UTC  ```  Created strongswan tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1228819](show_bug.cgi?id=1228819 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3991 strongswan: incorrect payload processing for different IKE versions [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1228820](show_bug.cgi?id=1228820 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3991 strongswan: incorrect payload processing for different IKE versions [epel-6]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1228821](show_bug.cgi?id=1228821 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3991 strongswan: incorrect payload processing for different IKE versions [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1222815#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-05 20:22:27 UTC  ``` Closing as this doesn't affect RHEL.   ``` |  |
