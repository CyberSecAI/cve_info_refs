    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability occurs when the fpadInfo property of a NetConnection object, if it is a SharedObject, is deleted.",

      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code.",

        "Unspecified vectors, likely via a malicious SWF file",
        "Network"

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to cause a Flash object to be created and manipulated in a specific way. This is usually done by convincing a victim to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious document.",
        "additional_information":"The vulnerability is triggered by deleting a SharedObject used in the fpadInfo property of a NetConnection object after the NetConnection is used.  Heap setup is necessary for exploitation, and PoC works on 64-bit systems."
