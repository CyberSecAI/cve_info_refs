CVE-2015-3750:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: WebKit does not enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for Content Security Policy (CSP) report requests.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of HSTS enforcement for CSP report requests, allowing potential interception of sensitive information.
  - Impact of exploitation: A man-in-the-middle attacker can obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic or spoof a report by modifying the data stream.
  - Attack vectors: Network-based man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and server.

CVE-2015-3751:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: WebKit improperly loads images within object elements when video controls are present, violating Content Security Policy (CSP).
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate CSP enforcement, allowing unauthorized loading of images.
  - Impact of exploitation: Image loading may violate a website's intended Content Security Policy directive.
  - Attack vectors: Malicious websites containing crafted video controls and nested object elements with images.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to create and host malicious websites.

CVE-2015-3742:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Memory corruption issue in WebKit.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption
  - Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution or denial of service (application crash)
  - Attack vectors: Crafted website
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker

CVE-2015-3744:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Memory corruption issue in WebKit.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption
  - Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution or denial of service (application crash)
  - Attack vectors: Crafted website
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker

CVE-2015-3754:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: WebKit's private-browsing implementation does not prevent caching of HTTP authentication credentials.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper caching of authentication credentials in private browsing mode.
  - Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can track users via crafted websites due to cached credentials.
  - Attack vectors: Crafted websites.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:  Remote attacker able to craft and host malicious web sites.

CVE-2015-3755:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: WebKit improperly handles malformed URLs
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Improper URL handling.
  - Impact of exploitation: User interface spoofing
  - Attack vectors: Malicious website with a malformed URL.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker able to craft and host malicious web sites.
