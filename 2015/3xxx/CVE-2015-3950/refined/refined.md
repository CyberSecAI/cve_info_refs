- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The XZERES 442SR Wind Turbine OS recognizes both POST and GET methods for data input. By using the GET method, an attacker can retrieve the ID from the browser and change the default user ID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The system does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests using the GET method.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve the user ID from the browser and change the default user ID, which has admin rights, potentially leading to loss of power for all attached systems.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation through a web-based interface. An attacker could craft a malicious link or website that, when accessed by a logged-in user, would execute the forged request without the user's awareness.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious link or webpage. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target device.
