{
  "CVE-2015-3167": {
    "description": "In contrib/pgcrypto, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report other error message texts. Fix by using a one-size-fits-all message.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The pgcrypto extension was not reporting a uniform error message when decryption failed due to an incorrect key.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information leakage via varied error messages during decryption attempts."
      ],
      "impact": "The variance in error reports during decryption could potentially be exploited to aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.",
       "attack_vectors": "Attacker attempts to decrypt data with an incorrect key, observes the error messages, and uses the variation in messages to learn more information about the encryption key." ,
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to invoke the pgcrypto decryption function with an incorrect key."
    }
