Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader handles the `WDAnnotEnumerator` object. By crafting a malicious PDF with specific JavaScript instructions, it's possible to bypass the JavaScript API restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- JavaScript API restriction bypass: The core issue is the ability to circumvent intended restrictions on the execution of JavaScript APIs within Adobe Reader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker can create a specially crafted PDF file containing the malicious JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious Web page: An attacker can host a malicious page that either triggers the vulnerability through JavaScript calls or includes a malicious PDF that, when opened, will exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need physical access to the target's system.
- User Interaction Required: The user must either visit a malicious website or open a specially crafted malicious PDF file for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Reader updates.
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned this vulnerability the identifier ZDI-15-195.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a Digital Vaccine filter.
