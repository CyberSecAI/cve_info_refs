# Janitza UMG Power Quality Measuring Products Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-265-03

## OVERVIEW

This advisory was originally posted to the US-CERT secure Portal library on September 22, 2015, and is being released to the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Mattijs van Ommeren of Applied Risk has identified several vulnerabilities in the Janitza UMG power quality measuring products. Janitza has produced new firmware and new documentation to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Janitza reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products:

* UMG 508,
* UMG 509,
* UMG 511,
* UMG 604, and
* UMG 605.

## IMPACT

An unauthenticated attacker can take full control of the device by leveraging the built-in script language. An attacker can adjust system parameters; manipulate measurement values and change the function of the device; and compromise availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the device and dependent systems.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Janitza is a company based in Germany that sells its products through worldwide partners.

The UMG line of devices is energy and power quality measurement products. According to Janitza, UMG products are deployed in the Energy sector. Janitza estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

## MITIGATION

Janitza has created new firmware to address these vulnerabilities. Users can download the new firmware at the following location:

<http://www.janitza.com/experimental-downloads.html>

Users may also download a manual telling how to secure a TCP/IP connection for UMG 604, UMG 605, UMG 508, UMG 509, UMG 511 and UMG 512 at the following location:

<http://www.janitza.com/download-manuals-current-devices.html>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Block outside access to Ports 1239/TCP, 1234/UDP, and 1235/UDP at the firewall. Use an intrusion detection system (IDS) or an intrusion prevention system (IPS) to monitor access to those ports.
* Shield the device from any publicly accessible networks by implementing proper network segregation and by filtering the exposed network services using a network firewall.
* Manage devices from a well secured management PC only, and users should not visit untrusted web sites.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
