Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-3270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control on the user resource endpoint in Apache Ambari. This allowed an authenticated non-administrative user to modify their own privileges and escalate to administrative level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is that the user resource endpoint didn't properly restrict access based on user roles. This allowed modification of user privileges by non-admin users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user could leverage this lack of control to elevate their own privileges to administrative level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** A non-administrative user could gain full administrative control over the Ambari system, which includes both API access and UI access.
- **Data Breaches:** This administrative access could be used to perform malicious activities such as data breaches or system manipulation within the Ambari system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability was exploitable remotely.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for the Ambari system.
- **API/UI Access:** The escalation of privileges can be achieved via API or the UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have an existing account with basic user privileges within the affected Ambari instance.
- The attacker must be able to access the network where the Ambari server is running.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text mentions that in the patched versions, access to the user resource endpoint is restricted to administrative users for escalating privileges of other users. However, regular users can still access it to change their own passwords.
- This vulnerability was discovered by security analysts at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
