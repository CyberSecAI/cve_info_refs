Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3081:

**Summary:** The provided documents describe CVE-2015-3081 as a race condition vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that allows attackers to bypass Internet Explorer's Protected Mode.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `BrokerMoveFileEx` method of Adobe Flash Player's FlashBroker component.
*   **NTFS Junction Attack:** This race condition can be exploited by using an NTFS junction point.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use):**  The `BrokerMoveFileEx` method opens a file, and then moves or copies it. The time gap between opening the file (checking) and moving it (using it) creates a window where a junction can be created.
*   **Inadequate Synchronization:** Lack of proper synchronization allows the attacker to manipulate the file system during a critical operation, bypassing the intended security measures.
* **IE Protected Mode Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the restrictions imposed by Internet Explorer's Protected Mode sandbox

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write an arbitrary file to the file system under user permissions.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete escape from the Internet Explorer Protected Mode sandbox, thereby gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As seen from the example where `calc.bat` was written to the startup folder, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely and the flash player component is usually invoked by a browser from a network source.
*   **NTFS Junction:** The attacker uses an NTFS junction to redirect file operations to attacker-controlled locations.
*   **OpLocks:** The exploit leverages oplocks to synchronize its actions with the FlashBroker operations, making use of the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker needs to achieve remote code execution within the context of a vulnerable Flash Player and IE process.
*   **Low Integrity Level IE Process:**  Exploitation requires the attack to be launched within a low-integrity level Internet Explorer process.
* **Timing Control:** Precise timing control is needed to win the race condition to replace the target file path with a junction.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit was tested by injecting a malicious DLL into a 32-bit low integrity level IE process.
* The vulnerability is patched in Adobe Flash Player versions 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172
* The content mentions that the exploit does not work in IE11 EPM, because it needs write access to the temporary folder to setup the junction.
