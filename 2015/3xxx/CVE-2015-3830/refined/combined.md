# Your recent fiddles

## Recentry created fiddles, including ones created while logged out

# JSFiddle changelog

## A log of all the changes made to JSFiddle â€“ big and small.

* ### **New** Your recent fiddles when logged out

  Saving a fiddle, even when you're logged out, will put it under the
  **Your recent fiddles** modal in the sidebar. They will eventually disappear (since they're anonymous),
  but now you'll have time to save them under your user after logging in.
* ### **New** Tailwind CSS

  Added **Tailwind CSS** to the list of precompilers - even though it's really HTML,
  you can activate it from the dropdown in the CSS panel. Tailwind CSS would be best used
  with **HTML Hot-reload** enabled.
* ### **Update** Code linting and formatting

  We've replaced the dated code linter and formatted with more modern ones: Stylelint and Prettier.
* ### **New** JSFiddle 3.0

  The 3.0 updates brings a lot of changes, most notably a modern UI refresh.

  There was an increadible amount of under-the-hood changes for the front-end,
  we've mostly moved away from pre-processors. The light/dark themes are using a modern `light-dark()` approach.
  The refactoring allows for more changes to be made in a spedier manner.

  + In the new sidebar you can find our mini-apps (right now the Color Palette Generator)
  + **System theme** follows your OS settings
  + **CSS Hot-reload** - styles update immidietly as you type
  + **HTML Hot-reload (experimental)** - update HTML immidietly as you type
  + **Results panel** color follows the selected theme
  + **Title and description** are now a single field
  + **Public Profile** page is completelty redesigned and can be easily used as your code showcase
  + **Groups are now Collections** and we have big plans for them
  + **Collections** are completely redesigned
  + Users can now add groups straight from the editor
* ### **New** Import fiddles as modules

  Import fiddle code into other fiddles with Modules and Imports.

  **JS Modules:** `import [name] from '@jsfiddle/[username]/[fiddle].js'`

  **CSS Import:** `@import url('@jsfiddle/[username]/[fiddle].css')`

  See how this works [in this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/rxwyeo73/).
* ### **Change** Fiddle listing shows latest version

  The fiddle listings (Public, Private, Titled, etc) will now display latest versions instead
  of the ones saved as Base versions - this was causing more confusion than good, so we decided
  to change this long-standing behavior.
* ### **Change** Evaluate code into the console

  Custom Console beta is getting more stable and feature-rich. Just added the ability to evaluate code in the console.
* ### **New** Console in the editor

  Introducing the first beta of the editor console - it's going to show you logs, warnings, errors without the need of opening full devtools.

  Console is avaialble for all users during beta, after that it'll be available for JSFiddle supporters.
* ### **New** More user's social links (Dev.to, Stack Overflow, Medium)

  You can add more of your social links `Settings / Social Media`, for Dev.to, Stack Overflow and Medium.
  These will be displayed on the profile section in Editor's sidebar and your public profile.
* ### **Change** Refactored Unsaved Drafts feature

  Unsaved drafts feature is completely rewritten with 100% fewer bugs and 10x more maintainable codebase â€“ as the author of the previous one, I had hard times figuring out what it does ðŸ¥´
