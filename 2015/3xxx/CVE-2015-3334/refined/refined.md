{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The browser/ui/website_settings/website_settings.cc in Google Chrome does not always display 'Media: Allowed by you' in a Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent display of camera permissions in the browser's settings, potentially leading to user confusion and unexpected camera access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user-assisted remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment by crafting a website that activates the camera when the user believes it to be disabled.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted website that exploits the inconsistency in permission display to gain unauthorized camera access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to create a malicious web page, and the user needs to have previously granted camera permission to the site and be under the false impression that camera access is not active."
