## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3334.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3336.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3335 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3335)

#### Description

The NaClSandbox::InitializeLayerTwoSandbox function in components/nacl/loader/sandbox\_linux/nacl\_sandbox\_linux.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not have RLIMIT\_AS and RLIMIT\_DATA limits for Native Client (aka NaCl) processes, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct row-hammer attacks or have unspecified other impact by leveraging the ability to run a crafted program in the NaCl sandbox.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/04/stable-channel-update_14.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, April 14, 2015

The Chrome team is overjoyed to announce the promotion of Chrome 42 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 42.0.2311.90 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps, extension and Web Platform APIs (including the [Push API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/push/raw-file/tip/index.html)!)
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance
* The answer to [life, the universe and everything](https://www.google.com/search?&q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything&gws_rd=ssl)

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/41.0.2272.0..42.0.2311.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [45 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M42&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[476786](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476786)] CVE-2015-1249: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.2 branch (currently 4.2.77.14).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

# CVE-2015-3334

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3333.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3335.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3334 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3334)

#### Description

browser/ui/website\_settings/website\_settings.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always display "Media: Allowed by you" in a Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission to a web site, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that turns on the camera at a time when the user believes that camera access is prohibited.
