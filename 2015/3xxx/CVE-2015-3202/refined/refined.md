Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3202:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `fusermount` binary in FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) not properly sanitizing the environment variables before invoking the `/bin/mount` or `/bin/umount` commands as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Environment Handling:** The `fusermount` binary does not clear or sanitize environment variables before executing `mount` or `umount` with elevated privileges.
- **Debugging Feature Abuse:** The `mount` command, when run with root privileges, allows access to debugging features controlled via environment variables (specifically `LIBMOUNT_MTAB`) that would normally be restricted for unprivileged users.
- **`setuid` usage:** The `fusermount` binary uses `setuid(geteuid())` to reset the RUID before invoking mount, however, it fails to sanitize environment variables leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By setting the `LIBMOUNT_MTAB` environment variable, an attacker can redirect mount's output to an arbitrary file, thus overwriting its content. This can be used to modify critical system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Environment Variable Manipulation:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `LIBMOUNT_MTAB` environment variable before calling the `fusermount` utility

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the target system.
- **Execution of `fusermount`:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable `fusermount` binary.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Environment Variable:** The attacker needs knowledge of `LIBMOUNT_MTAB` and how it can be used to redirect the output of `mount`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in FUSE versions prior to 2.9.4.
- Both FUSE and NTFS-3G were affected due to the use of an embedded fuse-lite implementation in ntfs-3g.
- The vulnerability was demonstrated by overwriting `/etc/bash.bashrc` or `/etc/default/locale` files, leading to root shell access on subsequent logins or cron job executions.
- A tweeted one-liner exploit for this vulnerability is available.
- The fix involves using `execle` to run external helpers instead of `execl`.

**Affected Software:**
- FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
- NTFS-3G when using the bundled fuse-lite implementation
- Multiple Linux Distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE and SUSE were affected
