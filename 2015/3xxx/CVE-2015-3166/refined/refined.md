{
  "CVE-2015-3166": {
    "Root cause": "The replacement implementation of `snprintf()` failed to check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls, specifically out-of-memory situations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate error handling",
      "Information Exposure"
    ],
    "Impact": "In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to information exposure due to the code assuming a buffer was overwritten when it was not.",
    "Attack vectors": "Unspecified. However, the vulnerability stems from system calls, so an attacker would likely need to induce out-of-memory conditions or similar system-level issues.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to trigger conditions where the system calls made by the `snprintf` implementation would fail."
