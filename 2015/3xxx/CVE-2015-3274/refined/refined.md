Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3274:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that several web services returning user information did not properly sanitize text within custom text profile fields (specifically textareas).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is that custom profile fields (textareas) were not passed through the `external_format_text` function when returned by web services. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into these fields.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system failed to properly sanitize user-provided input before outputting it in a web service context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attacks:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the user profile fields. This code could then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the profile information.
- **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
- **Malware Distribution:** Injected JavaScript could potentially redirect users to malicious websites for malware distribution.
- **Defacement:** Malicious code could also be used to deface pages or display unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Services:** The primary attack vector is through the web services that return user information, particularly those including custom profile fields.
- **User Profile Input:** An attacker could insert malicious script into their own custom text profile fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:**  The attacker needs a user account on the affected Moodle instance to modify their own profile information and inject malicious code into the custom profile fields.
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript to craft malicious payloads.

**Affected versions:**
- 2.9, 2.8 to 2.8.6, 2.7 to 2.7.8 and earlier unsupported versions

**Fixed versions:**
- 2.9.1, 2.8.7 and 2.7.9

**Additional Notes:**
- The severity of this issue is considered "Minor."
- The issue was reported by Marina Glancy.
- The issue is tracked internally as MDL-50130.
