A quick update on the abrt situation.

Most of these issues center around file ownership and contents under
so-called problem directories (subdirectories of /var/tmp/abrt or
/var/spool/abrt).  Problem directories are owned by root and have mode
750 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, which suggest that with this older
abrt version, exploits are only possible if uploads are enabled in some
way (see below).

abrt writes coredumps to existing world-writable files owned by other
users, disclosing coredump contents across user boundaries.  This
affects a default configuration, but requires an application to crash
while its current directory is world-writable, so exploiting it seems
difficult.  We have assigned CVE-2015-3142.
<<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1212818>>

===

Root cause of vulnerability: The abrt service writes core dumps to existing files owned by other users.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Information disclosure. Writing core dump files to world-writable locations can disclose sensitive information.
Impact of exploitation: Disclosure of core dump information across user boundaries.
Attack vectors: An application crash while its current directory is world-writable.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs an application to crash while its current directory is world-writable.
