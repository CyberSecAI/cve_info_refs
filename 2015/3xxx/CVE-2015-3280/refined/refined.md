  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2015-3280",
    "root_cause": "A flaw exists in OpenStack Compute (nova) when handling resize operations. If a user deletes an instance while it is in the resize state, the original instance is not always properly removed from the compute node it was running on.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition between resize and delete operations.",
      "Lack of proper cleanup of instance files after a delete during resize."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) by repeatedly resizing and deleting instances, leading to disk space exhaustion on compute nodes. This can prevent the scheduler from selecting those nodes for new VMs, effectively rendering them unusable.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user can initiate the attack by using the resize and delete APIs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires valid credentials to authenticate against the OpenStack API. No specific network position is required, as the attack relies on the ability to send requests to the API."
