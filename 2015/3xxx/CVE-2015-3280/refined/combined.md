## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1898)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute instance
migration process. Because the migration process does not terminate
when an instance is deleted, an authenticated user could bypass
user quota and deplete all available disk space by repeatedly re-sizing
and deleting an instance. (CVE-2015-3241)

A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute handled the resize
state. If an authenticated user deleted an instance while it was in the
resize state, it could cause the original instance to not be deleted from
the compute node it was running on, allowing the user to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2015-3280)

Note: CVE-2015-3241 was already addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 7.0 in a previous release.

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin of Webzilla LTD as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-3241, and George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD
and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc. as the original reporters of
CVE-2015-3280.

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

### Bug Description

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create a new instance,waiting until it’s status goes to ACTIVE state

2) Call resize API

3) Delete the instance immediately after the task\_state is “resize\_migrated” or vm\_state is “resized”

4) Repeat 1 through 3 in a loop

I have kept attached program running for 4 hours, all instances created are deleted (nova list returns empty list) but I noticed instances directories with the name “<instance\_uuid>\_resize> are not deleted from the instance path of the compute nodes (mainly from the source compute nodes where the instance was running before resize). If I keep this program running for couple of more hours (depending on the number of compute nodes), then it completely uses the entire disk of the compute nodes (based on the disk\_allocation\_ratio parameter value). Later, nova scheduler doesn’t select these compute nodes for launching new vms and starts reporting error "No valid hosts found".

Note: Even the periodic tasks doesn't cleanup these orphan instance directories from the instance path.

This sounds like a potential denial of service vector, so I've added an incomplete security advisory task and subscribed Nova's core security reviewers to comment.

This is a valid issue. But it should be limited to issuing a delete before the instance.vm\_state is 'resized' since there is code to cleanup a resized instance if vm\_state is 'resized'.

It's going to take a little bit of thought to get the coordination between delete and resize correct for this.

@Tushar Do you want to acknowledge a company along with your name or is this reported independently ?

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Nova instance delete in resize state may leak

Reporter: Tushar Patil

Products: Nova

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2

Description:

Tushar Patil reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

George: our vulnerability managers and software developers work in parallel documenting and fixing security bugs. Hopefully a backportable (at least as far as stable/icehouse which is our oldest supported branch) fix will be along soon from one of the Nova developers since Andrew has triaged it at High importance.

Tristan: your latest impact description in comment #11 looks accurate--thanks!

@nova-coresec: this have been reported almost 2 month ago... Any progress on the fix ?

Updating affected version line:

Title: Nova instance delete in resize state may leak

Reporter: George Shuklin (Webzilla LTD) and Tushar Patil (NTT DATA, Inc)

Products: Nova

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1

Description:

George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

Hi,

The attached fix addresses all the issues mentioned in the attached excel sheet. Please have a look at it.

The migration db interface code is already submitted by me in patch [1] but since it is not merged yet I have included it here.

As of now lot of unit tests are failing because of proposed changes. I will fix broken unit tests once my patch is approved by the security team.

Please review the code.

Firstly I want to admit upfront:

1) I'm new to reviewing code in LP. I'm sorry if there is an established protocol I'm breaking. Just tell me the right thing to do.

2) I could be off base here. I'll clearly continue to dig into this.

While there is no doubt that the get\_latest\_by\_instance() API changes are neat. They represent an (IIUC) RPC bump, which would be great to avoid for backports to stable/\*. Can't we get the same result using MigrationList.get\_by\_filters() and then open code the lookup for latest?

Based on the scenarios you logged it looks like catching the InstanceNotFound exception should be enough but I have a vauge nagging fear that we're missing something. No doubt what you've done is a long way to a solution.

Thanks for putting up a patch!

Reviewing the patch has caused me to dig into this issue deeply once again so I want to record some thoughts here.

This issue is exacerbated by not having locks during the resize process. The terminate process would wait for the completion of the resize at which point the delete would be handled fine. Adding locking is not trivial because the resize executes on both source and dest hosts.

There is no good way to interrupt a resize. If a delete comes in during a resize operation with no way to interrupt the resize or grab a lock then it's always possible that the resize disk could be created after any cleanup that's done. The traditional way to interrupt a task is to delete the instance db record which will cause an exception to be raised on the next instance.save(), but the delete process doesn't know when the resize code will hit that.

As far as cleaning up the \_resize disks, the poll\_unconfirmed \_resizes task should eventually handle it but it typically has a long window before it will clean up an uncomfirmed resize and the task is turned off by default.

Looking at the patch specifically it doesn't appear to fully address the issue I raised above. Since the resize is not interrupted it's possible that the cleanup code will run before the \_resize disk is created. It will reduce the timewindow for the race condition but not eliminate it. It's also libvirt specific and this vulnerability could exist for any driver that creates a separate disk for resize. The RPC bump is also an issue for backporting the change. And finally the use of utils.execute to ssh and rm -rf a directory is concerning.

Thinking simply, just ensuring that virt driver destroy() methods look for and clean up resize disks would do a lot to alleviate this.

I'm not the developer, just operator.

From my point of view (and original report) the problem is with scp/rsync, which keeps copying files after instance is deleted. It keeps file opened even if you remove them, and eats network and cpu.

My naiive approach (like if I would be developer) would be:

1. Save pid of scp/rsync process in migration record.

2. If instance is terminated during migration, mark is as 'aborting' in migration record.

3. On source host for each migration in aborting state (related to 'own' host):

a) Kill scp/rsync (by pid)

b) Delete local files

4. On destination:

a) Delete local files

To keep track of the files on all systems, they all should be saved in migration record.

Again, I'm not the developer, I don't know all aspects of RPC around nova-api/compute, but as operator I really don't want to see stray scp/rsync processes on compute, operating on deleted disks.

George: that seems to be to be a slightly different issue that what's reported here, unless I've missed the subtlety of what's reported here. I was under the impression that the \_resize disks were being left around indefinitely, vs your concern that they're not cleaned up immediately.

There has been talk for quite a while about getting to a point where tasks are cancel-able within Nova, but at this point there's very little to work with to make that happen. The solution you've proposed would involve a db migration and multiple RPC changes while being primarily libvirt specific. Making that work generally across hypervisors will take a bit more abstraction and effort, and doing that in a backwards compatible way may end up being a challenge as well.

For the issue reported here I would propose starting with a simple solution that cleans up any resize disks during the virt driver destroy() call. The xenapi driver already does a similiar thing for rescue disks.

For the issue George is discussion I would look at adding a small store of instance->task mappings to each driver that it can use to clean up tasks during the destroy() process.

Yes, seems fine. One important notice: there is few methods of copy disk (rsync via rsyncd, rsync via ssh, scp) - and all them should be terminated properly.

Btw: If you have problems with reproducing setup, I can give access to realservers laboratory installation with few compute hosts and scp as migration method (juno).

Hi,

Please review the attached patch.

In this patch I have added periodic tasks to cleanup instance files left out either on the source or destination compute node when the instance is deleted during resizing.

This is a much cleaner approach than the previous attached patch as it doesn't involve adding new interface to the virt driver and compute rpcapi.

The attached patch and the patch [1] which is currently under review, will resolve all the issues mentioned in 'resize\_scenarios.xlsx ' (refer comment #19).

Hi George:

This patch doesn't address killing orphan rsync/scp processes left out in the migrate\_disk\_and\_power\_off method. I think this fix is outside the scope of the problem we are trying to solve.

This is not a full review but after some review and testing the patch is looking good to me.

It doesn't eliminate the bug but it does reduce the severity and allow operators to mitigate.

I'll do a more in depth review tomorrow and continue to test.

+2 on the current patch. I didn't examine the tests closely, but if they pass, agree that we can fix them post-merge.

The backport to Kilo is trivial, the Juno one is a little more complex.

Juno backport. This isn't a simple cherry-pick but the changes aren;t complex and are due

1) tests moving in kilo

2) in kilo nova/objects/base.py has "obj\_as\_admin()" that's not in Juno

Passes (nova) tox -epy27,pep8

Tempest didn't pass. It failed differently on 3 runs so I'm confused.

I'll try to build a Juno multi-compute stack early next week to perform additional checks.

@nova-coresec, please review proposed patch.

Here is the updated impact description (removing Icehouse from affected releases):

Title: Nova instance delete in resize state may leak

Reporter: George Shuklin (Webzilla LTD) and Tushar Patil (NTT DATA, Inc)

Products: Nova

Affects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and version 2015.1.0

Description:

George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

For the impact description in comment #77, let's try to avoid non-vulnerability-related uses of the overloaded term "leak" to reduce confusion. How about switching the title to something like "Nova may fail to delete images in resize state".

The backports look okay to me, as best I can tell without seeing test runs (which is not very well). Sounds like tony is still seeing tempest failures on the kilo one. Not sure what to say about that.

Hi Tony,

In this case, following 7 tempest test were failing.

1) tempest.api.network.test\_metering\_extensions.MeteringIpV6TestJSON

2) tempest.api.network.test\_metering\_extensions.MeteringTestJSON

3) tempest.thirdparty.boto.test\_ec2\_instance\_run.InstanceRunTest

5) tempest.thirdparty.boto.test\_s3\_buckets.S3BucketsTest

6) tempest.thirdparty.boto.test\_s3\_ec2\_images.S3ImagesTest

7) tempest.thirdparty.boto.test\_s3\_objects.S3BucketsTest.test\_create\_get\_delete\_object[id-4eea567a-b46a-405b-a475-6097e1faebde]

B) When I ran tempest tests after applying security patch (attached in comment # 76) on stable/kilo, in that case also above mentioned tests were failing.

Could you please share which tempest tests were failing in your stable/kilo environment, so that I can analyze whether these tests are failing because of proposed changes or not ?

Hi all,

 I did some testing yesterday on the juno and kilo backports and for both branches I see a similar (though not identical) set of failures

I get either 7 or 11 failures of these I'm ignoring the tempest.thirdparty.boto.\* tests. In both cases I don't see a change in the failure rates with the appropriate patch applied.

However that's all done with an all-in-one devstack setup. I think It's important to test with a multi-node setup. (which I'm doing now)

Once I've completed those tests I'll post a rebased set of patches.

Tony.

Here is the updated impact description (fixing affected version and including comment #83 suggestions):

Title: Nova may fail to delete images in resize state

Reporter: George Shuklin (Webzilla LTD) and Tushar Patil (NTT DATA, Inc)

Products: Nova

Affects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1

Description:

George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

commit 18d6b5cc79973fc553daf7a92f22cce4dc0ca013

Author: Rajesh Tailor <email address hidden>

Date: Wed Mar 4 05:05:19 2015 -0800

Delete orphaned instance files from compute nodes

While resizing/revert-resizing instance, if instance gets deleted

    in between, then instance files remains either on the source or

    destination compute node.

To address this issue, added a new periodic task

    '\_cleanup\_incomplete\_migrations' which takes care of deleting

    instance files from source/destination compute nodes and then

    mark migration record as failed so that it doesn't appear again

    in the next periodic task run.

A fix for this issue has been released, but I don't believe it addresses the CVE. The essence of the CVE is that by manipulating a race condition a malicious authenticated user can cause a compute host to run out of disk space. The fix is to periodically clean up the disk space. This fix means that a malicious authenticated user can still waste disk space during the interval of the periodic task. With automation, this is still likely to be a lot.

Contrast this with change Ie03acc00a7c904aec13c90ae6a53938d08e5e0c9 . In this instance, we decided that the ability for a malicious authenticated user to waste disk space for any period of time was a security bug, which we closed. The fix for this CVE is not consistent.

I note that although this race condition is somewhat complicated, it is not described anywhere in either the commit message or code comments of the accepted fix. I will describe it here:

RESIZE:

On src compute:

1. Copy instance files from src to dest

2. Set instance.host == dest

3. Cast finish\_resize on dest

On dest compute:

4. Set instance.vm\_state = RESIZED

DELETE, on api:

1. If instance.vm\_state == RESIZED: confirm\_resized()

2. Call terminate\_instance on instance.host

If delete is called between resize steps 1 and 2, delete will be called on src because instance.host has not yet been updated. As vm\_state != RESIZED, confirm\_resized will not be called, and files will be left on dest.

If delete is called between resize steps 2 and 4, delete will be called on dest, because instance.host has been updated. As vm\_state != RESIZED, confirm\_resized will not be called, and files will be left on src.

It should be possible to fix this properly by closing the race condition. The periodic task might remain, but would be redundant in normal operation. The outline of the fix is:

\* Remove the confirm\_resized call from nova api delete.

\* Add a synchronized(instance.uuid) block around RESIZE steps 2 and 3 above (yes, including the cast).

\* Add a synchronized(instance.uuid) block around finish\_resize

\* Add check inside the synchronized blocks in finish\_resize for deleted. Fail if deleted.

\* Add check inside do\_terminate\_instance for current migration. If current migration, also cleanup other node following current periodic task.

Thanks Matthew for digging that out!

Your scenario seems correct in theory, but is it a race someone can win in practice ?

Is there a reason why the Nova bug report is still New ?

It looks like Matthew has changed the status of the bug from fix released to new in an attempt to solicit further input from nova developers, but ultimately this should I think be opened as a separate bug report. If the described scenario can be confirmed exploitable then the VMT would end up requesting a new CVE for an incomplete/partial fix instead.

Delete orphaned instance files from compute nodes

While resizing/revert-resizing instance, if instance gets deleted

    in between, then instance files remains either on the source or

    destination compute node.

To address this issue, added a new periodic task

    '\_cleanup\_incomplete\_migrations' which takes care of deleting

    instance files from source/destination compute nodes and then

    mark migration record as failed so that it doesn't appear again

    in the next periodic task run.

Hi, I changed the status because I wanted it documented somewhere. I felt that it made more sense to re-open the existing bug than open a new one because the original bug still exists. It was quite a lot of work to first determine what the problem was that the original patch was trying to fix[1], and then convince myself that it was not fixed, and I wanted to ensure that was recorded somewhere. I am not, however, immediately about to work on this myself.

[1] Better commit messages, please!

# OSSA-2015-017: Nova may fail to delete images in resize state

# OSSA-2015-017: Nova may fail to delete images in resize state[Â¶](#ossa-2015-017-nova-may-fail-to-delete-images-in-resize-state "Link to this heading")

Date:

September 01, 2015

CVE:

CVE-2015-3280

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Nova: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

## Patches[Â¶](#patches "Link to this heading")

* <https://review.openstack.org/219301> (Juno)
* <https://review.openstack.org/219300> (Kilo)
* <https://review.openstack.org/219299> (Liberty)

## Credits[Â¶](#credits "Link to this heading")

* George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD (CVE-2015-3280)
* Tushar Patil from NTT Data (CVE-2015-3280)

## References[Â¶](#references "Link to this heading")

* <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1392527>
* <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3280>

## Notes[Â¶](#notes "Link to this heading")

* This fix will be included in future 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.2
  (kilo) releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-28 12:34:54 UTC  ``` It was reported from upstream that a vulnerability was found in Nova resize state. If an authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.  Affected versions: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c6)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-14 23:18:16 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1263019](show_bug.cgi?id=1263019)]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c7)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-14 23:18:52 UTC  ```  Created openstack-nova tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1263020](show_bug.cgi?id=1263020 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-3280 openstack-nova: Deleting instances in resize state fails [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c10)  Matthew Booth    2015-09-18 13:53:13 UTC  ``` Please see upstream commits rather than patches attached to this bz.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1257942#c11)  Summer Long    2015-10-15 00:30:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack upstream project for reporting this issue.
