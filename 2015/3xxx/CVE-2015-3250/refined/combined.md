# Apache Directory LDAP API™

## The modern Java LDAP API

The Apache Directory LDAP API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a "schema aware" API with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP servers, not only ApacheDS but any LDAP server.

The API is OSGI ready and extensible. New controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future.

# News

## Apache Directory LDAP API 2.1.7 released *posted on August 08th, 2024*

The Apache Directory Team is proud to announce the availability of version 2.1.7 of the Apache Directory LDAP API.

The Apache Directory LDAP API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server, but should work pristine with any LDAP server.

It’s also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future. It’s also OSGi capable.

This release is fixing a few issues and add a new control:

* [DIRAPI-394](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-394) Add support for control 1.3.6.1.4.1.30221.2.5.44 (Naming Entries With entryUUID)
* [DIRAPI-398](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-398) Release Pooled LDAP Connections when closed
* [DIRAPI-400](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-400) Hang in LDAP URL parser
* [DIRAPI-401](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-401) Unhandled Exception (NegativeArraySizeException) in Asn1Decoder
* [DIRAPI-402](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-402) unhandled exception (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) in LDAP URL parser
* [DIRAPI-403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-403) OutOfMemory error in Asn1Decoder for LDAP messages
* [DIRAPI-404](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-404) An inefficient constructor
* [DIRAPI-405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-405) A possible handle leak

Downloads are available [here](downloads-2.html) and the User’s Guide is [there](user-guide.html)

The Apache LDAP API 1.0.2 that has just been released fix a [critical security issue](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-1337): A bug in the way the SSL Filter was setup made it possible for another thread to use the connection before the TLS layer has been established, if the connection has already been used and put back in a pool of connections, leading to leaking any information contained in this request (including the credentials when sending a BIND request)

## Apache Directory LDAP API 1.0.0-M19 released *posted on July 1st, 2013*

The Apache Directory Team is proud to announce the availability of version 1.0.0-M19 of the Apache Directory LDAP API.

The Apache Directory LDAP API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server, but should work pristine with any LDAP server.

It’s also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future. It’s also OSGi capable.

Here are the release note for Apache Directory LDAP API 1.0.0-M19:

* [DIRAPI-148](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRAPI-148) We can’t inject entries with attributes containing a null value

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

That's probably a typo, CVE-2015-3250 being the assigned one.

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Directory LDAP API 1.0.0-M31 released

The Apache Directory Team is proud to announce the availability of the
1.0.0-M31 version of the Apache Directory LDAP API.

The Apache Directory LDAP client API is an ongoing effort to provide
an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing
LDAPAPI (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP
server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server,
but should work pristine with any LDAP server.

It's also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and
network layer could be added or used in the near future. It's also
OSGi capable.

This release is fixing a security vulnerability : CVE-2015-3050, a
Timing Attack vulnerability.
