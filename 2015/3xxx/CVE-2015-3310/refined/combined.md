Package        : ppp
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3310
Debian Bug     : 782450

Emanuele Rocca discovered that ppp, a daemon implementing the
Point-to-Point Protocol, was subject to a buffer overflow when
communicating with a RADIUS server. This would allow unauthenticated
users to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the daemon.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.7-r3** |

### Background

PPP is a Unix implementation of the Point-to-Point Protocol

### Description

A buffer overflow was discovered in the rc\_mksid function in
plugins/radius/util.c in PPP when the PID for pppd is greater than 65535.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PPP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/ppp-2.4.7-r3"

```

Subject: ppp: Buffer overflow in radius plugin
Date: Sun, 12 Apr 2015 14:20:02 +0200
```
Package: ppp
Version: 2.4.6-3
Severity: important
Tags: patch

On systems with more than 65535 processes running, pppd aborts when
sending a "start" accounting message to the RADIUS server because of a
buffer overflow in rc_mksid.

The process id is used in rc_mksid to generate a pseudo-unique string,
assuming that the hex representation of the pid will be at most 4
characters (FFFF). __sprintf_chk(), used when compiling with
optimization levels greater than 0 and FORTIFY_SOURCE, detects the
buffer overflow and makes pppd crash.

The following patch fixes the problem.

Source: ppp
Binary: ppp ppp-udeb ppp-dev
Architecture: source amd64 all
Version: 2.4.6-3.1
Distribution: unstable
Urgency: high
Maintainer: Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it>
Changed-By: Emanuele Rocca <ema@debian.org>
Description:
 ppp        - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) - daemon
 ppp-dev    - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) - development files
 ppp-udeb   - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) - package for Debian Installer (udeb)
Closes: [782450](bugreport.cgi?bug=782450)
Changes:
 ppp (2.4.6-3.1) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * Urgency high due to fix for DoS vulnerability.
   * Fix buffer overflow in rc_mksid().
     The function converts the PID of pppd to hex to generate a pseudo-unique
     string. If the process id is bigger than 65535 (FFFF), its hex
     representation will be longer than 4 characters, resulting in a buffer
     overflow. This bug can be exploited to cause a remote DoS.

Shouldn't this be 65536? If you're trying to limit to 0xFFFF then 65535  too
small. "getpid () & 0xFFFF" might be clearer than using the modulus operator
and should have exactly the same effect.

Good catch! You are right, the patch limits to 0xFFFE instead of 0xFFFF.

However it does fix the vulnerability, so I don't think a new upload is
required.

Subject: squeeze update of ppp?

Hello Marco & Emanuele,

the Debian LTS team would like to fix the security issues which are
currently open in the Squeeze version of ppp:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/ppp>

Would you like to take care of this yourself? We are still understaffed so
any help is always highly appreciated.

If yes, please follow the workflow we have defined here:
<http://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development>

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org
(via a debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the the source package,
or even with a pointer to your packaging repository), and the members
of the LTS team will take care of the rest. Indicate clearly whether you
have tested the updated package or not.

If you don't want to take care of this update, it's not a problem, we
will do our best with your package. Just let us know whether you would
like to review and/or test the updated package before it gets released.

Thank you very much.

Raphaël Hertzog,
  on behalf of the Debian LTS team.

PS: A member of the LTS team might start working on this update at
any point in time. You can verify whether someone is registered

Hi Emanuele,

Did you send your patch upstream? If not, would you mind if I did so?
Would you be able to provide a "Signed-off-by" line as required by upstream?

Thanks,
Chris

Package        : ppp
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3310
Debian Bug     : 782450

Emanuele Rocca discovered that ppp, a daemon implementing the
Point-to-Point Protocol, was subject to a buffer overflow when
communicating with a RADIUS server. This would allow unauthenticated
users to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the daemon.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
