Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3310:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A buffer overflow exists in the `rc_mksid` function within the `plugins/radius/util.c` file of the `ppp` package. This function generates a session ID string for RADIUS accounting messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The `rc_mksid` function uses `sprintf` to format a string. It includes the process ID (PID) of the `pppd` daemon, formatting it as a 4-character hexadecimal string (`%04X`). If the PID is greater than 65535 (0xFFFF), the resulting hexadecimal representation will be longer than 4 characters, causing a buffer overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate or restrict the size of the PID before using it in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash the `pppd` daemon. By sending specially crafted RADIUS start accounting messages, they can force a buffer overflow, leading to a daemon crash and a DoS condition.
- **Remote code execution:** While not explicitly mentioned in all sources, the possibility of more severe impacts such as RCE can't be ruled out due to the nature of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The attacker sends specially crafted RADIUS start accounting messages to the vulnerable `pppd` daemon.
- **Remote:** The attacker doesn't require local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send RADIUS messages to the server running the vulnerable `pppd` daemon.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when the PID of the `pppd` process is greater than 65535. This can be caused by repeated connections, each spawning a new process and incrementing the PID.
- The issue is present in versions of `ppp` up to and including 2.4.6.
- When compiled with GCC's Object Size Checking, the `sprintf` call is replaced with `__sprintf_chk`, which can detect the buffer overflow and causes the daemon to crash with a `SIGABRT`.
