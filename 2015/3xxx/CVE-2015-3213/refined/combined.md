# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1227098#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-01 22:52:37 UTC  ``` Ray Strode of Red Hat reports:  Clutter contains APIs for recognizing finger and mouse movement based gestures. GNOME Shell uses these APIs to recognize when the user lifts the "screen shield" to initiate the screen unlock process (where a password would normally be  entered).   A bug in clutter's gesture handling code leads to a crash in some cases when  the user performs gestures. This crash can lead to screen lock bypass. The bug  was fixed upstream in clutter 1.16.2  External reference: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749847>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1227098#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-27 22:27:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:1510 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1510.html>   ``` |  |

## Background

For a long time, GNOME has been using cgit for code hosting and Bugzilla for issue tracking. Over the years, these tools have become increasingly antiquated: the user experience hasn't significantly improved and new competitors make them feel old, in tools and features provided, integration, workflows and look.

GNOME needs to improve its development infrastructure. It needs to provide its developers with a more efficient, integrated, featureful and enjoyable set of tools. It also needs to provide a developer experience that does not act as a barrier to new contributors, to ensure the future of the GNOME project.

Nowadays, GitHub is used by most new Free Software projects and sets the expectations of new contributors. GitHub is not Free Software, of course, which makes it unacceptable to many in the GNOME community.

## Available Solutions

Available alternatives to cgit and Bugzilla include GOGS, gitea and Pagure. However, these were rejected early on in this evaluation, due to their contributor levels and sustainability.

This evaluation therefore focuses on two main solutions: GitLab and Phabricator. If you are unfamiliar with these, please see the [introduction to these two technologies](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29GitLabAndPhabricator.html). Be aware that GitLab isn't simply a GitHub clone!

**Either of these options would be hosted on GNOME infrastructure.**

## Migration Possibilities

GNOME has an established Bugzilla instance with many thousands of issues stored in it. Migration is therefore a critical issue when discussing switching to a different solution.

Our contention is that copying/moving every existing GNOME issue to a new issue tracker is impractical and, in many situations, undesirable. Instead, we propose the following migration plan:

* Shortly after the new solution is setup, disable issue reporting in Bugzilla (as well as new accounts, milestones, etc).
* Provide tooling to allow maintainers to do a "shallow" migration of their module's issues to the new solution (copying the content of the issue over as well as a copy of its comments, but not reproducing CCs, accounts, detailed history).
* After a length of time (to be decided), potentially switch Bugzilla into read-only mode (no new comments, attachments, etc)

This is just a sketch and the team behind this proposal are committed to listening to the GNOME community and creating a migration plan based on their concerns.

## Methodology

This review has been conducted by a small group of GNOME contributors who have a range of experience within the project, including module maintenance, newcomer experience, code review and design.

An effort has been made to consult with relevant parties, including the Translation Team, Sysadmin Team, Release Team and Bug Squad. We have also reached out to both GitLab and Phabricator and people using them in a daily basis.

Other steps that have been taken as a part of the review:

* Studied existing GNOME workflows and requirements
* Setup of test installations, along with some stress testing for issue database size
* Detailed feature review
* Consultation with users of each of the options under consideration

Despite all these steps, we are not claiming to be experts or to have complete knowledge. We therefore welcome any input, particularly from the GNOME community.

## Background Information

* [Issues with GNOME's existing development infrastructure](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29ExistingState.html)
* [GNOME's development infrastructure requirements](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29Requirements.html)
* [Introduction to GitLab and Phabricator](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29GitLabAndPhabricator.html)
* [Feature comparison between GitLab and Phabricator](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29FeatureMatrix.html)

## Evaluation

Phabricator and GitLab are both excellent tools. However, it is important to realise that they are quite different in their priorities and how they are structured. This in turn requires that their respective strengths and weaknesses be recognized and considered alongside GNOME's priorities and requirements.

### Sysadmin deployment/maintenance

GitLab is available as RPMs, which makes it trivial to deploy and update - our experience is that it is very quick to set up. Phabricator isn't difficult to set up, but it does involve a bit more work.

### Usability/user friendliness for newcomers

GitLab provides a UI for common code hosting operations, including forking, merging, editing files and committing (useful for documentation more than code). It also provides an experience which is similar to GitHub, which has advantages when attracting developers who are familiar with that platform.

GitLab is quite easy to navigate, and shows the key resources for each module at a glance.

Phabricator doesn't provide a web UI for common code tasks. Its modular approach means that the UI is less integrated as a whole: while different Phabricator "applications" can use common links to data objects, the site navigation as a whole doesn't always provide a clear hierarchy or overview.

### Code hosting

Phabricator's code hosting features are somewhat rudimentary by today's standards. As already mentioned, it doesn't provide UI for repository management. It doesn't allow grouping repositories by teams or area (something GNOME does currently for infrastructure, different types of module).

Phabricator is designed to work with a variety of version control systems - it isn't Git-focused.

GitLab provides a more modern code hosting experience, which is obviously Git-focused.

### Issue tracking

Phabricator is primarily a project management tool. It has comprehensive capabilities for tracking and managing issues over the various stages they go through in the development process. It allows management of team workflows and workloads, and is highly milestone and release-focused. It is highly customisable.

GitLab's issue tracking is primarily organized around repositories. However, it does also allow a global project-wide view of issues. Freeform tags allow organizing issues (tags can be for the whole of GNOME or per-repository). It also has a kanban-style task management feature, called the [Issue Board](https://about.gitlab.com/features/issueboard/).

### Code review

Code review in Phabricator is very good and people seem to like it a lot. However, it is also patch-based - it requires that the developer generates patch files locally and uploads them through the browser, or use the [arcanist](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist_diff/) tool.

GitLab's code review is also good. The standard workflow is to review a branch as part of a merge request.

### Other features

Phabricator and GitLab provide a range of additional tools that could be beneficial for the GNOME project. This section only covers some of them.

Continuous integration:

* GitLab has a CI runner that can be used to run jobs for every commit. This is interesting to GNOME, particularly in relation to Flatpak.
* Phab doesn't really have CI.

Task management/kanban:

* Both Phabricator and GitLab have task management boards. Phabricator's is probably more advanced and operates at a project level. GitLab's task management boards can be created for groups of repositories, and so could be used by the Release Team.

Design review:

* Phabricator has a design review module which allows commenting on mockups, tracking changes to mockups and linking of issues to designs. Its project management features also allow explicit design review steps as a part of the development process.

CLI tool:

* With GitLab, a number of operations that currently require git-bz can be done using Git only (for example: fetching the changes for a bug fix). There is a CLI tool which allows a wide range of actions to be done from the command line, although it isn't particularly user friendly.
* Phabricator
  + Collabora has a git-phab tool which is very similar to git-bz but better
  + [Arcanist](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/) is a cli interface to Phabricator

### Long-term sustainability

Both GitLab and Phabricator have companies behind them. GitLab is a larger organization, but both have a excellent development rate. Both of the solutions we are considering are open source, and so could be picked up by communities should the companies behind them fail.

Phabricator does have relatively high adoption in the FOSS world and so could be said to have more community buy-in.

## Conclusion

GNOME's requirement is for a complete solution that provides integrated code hosting and issue tracking. Key requirements include a modern code hosting solution, easy adoption and navigation by newcomers (who might already be familiar with GitHub) and a relatively simple set of issue tracking features.

While Phabricator provides some excellent features and has first-class project management capabilities, its code hosting provision is not at the level being sought by GNOME.

It is the recommendation of this evaluation that, due to its rounded feature set, modern code-hosting and integrated UI, GitLab is the best choice for the GNOME project.

As a final part of this evaluation, we have documented the [expected GNOME contributor workflows when using GitLab](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29GitLabWorkflows.html).

You have a [GitLab test instance](https://gitlab-test.gnome.org/GNOME) in our infrastructure to play with. Note that the projects in this instance are artificially fill with issues reports and other testing use cases, and doesn't represent accurately a real use case. You can find more realistic cases in projects hosted in [gitlab.com itself](https://gitlab.com/explore).

## Consultation and Comments

A consultation will be held with the GNOME community before a final decision is made about future infrastructure choices. In the mean time, feel free to leave comments on the [comments page](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29Comments.html).

## Feedback and Comments

In this page we will put the community input the initiative received and the points we need to take into consideration. Please don't edit this page, rather add a comment in the [comments page](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29Comments.html) or through the email or IRC.

See [community feedback](./Initiatives%282f%29DevelopmentInfrastructure%282f%29CommunityInput.html) for a summary of the responses we've had to the migration proposal.

ZoomAction and RotateAction should both use the NONE trigger edge.  TapAction is already using the BEFORE trigger edge, so it should not be changed.  PanAction and SwipeAction are a bit of a toss up; I can see them both taking into account the drag threshold, so they could use the AFTER trigger edge like they currently do.  *then* we can change the default trigger edge value in GestureAction to be NONE - even if, to be fair, the intended default when I wrote it was to take into account the drag threshold unless explicitly overridden, which would make the AFTER trigger edge the correct default. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=710227#c6)  Emmanuele Bassi (:ebassi)    2013-12-05 11:41:18 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 263575](attachment.cgi?id=263575 "gesture-action: fix memory corruption") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=263575&action=edit "gesture-action: fix memory corruption") [[review]](review?bug=710227&attachment=263575):  okay. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=710227#c7)  Emmanuele Bassi (:ebassi)    2013-12-05 11:54:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 263580](attachment.cgi?id=263580 "gesture: Clean up trigger edge accessors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=263580&action=edit "gesture: Clean up trigger edge accessors") [[review]](review?bug=710227&attachment=263580) gesture: Clean up trigger edge accessors  Use G_GNUC_INTERNAL instead of the leading underscore, as we may make the accessor functions public at some point.

I can definitely accept a patch to make it public - in fact, [attachment 263580](attachment.cgi?id=263580 "gesture: Clean up trigger edge accessors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=263580&action=edit "gesture: Clean up trigger edge accessors") [[review]](review?bug=710227&attachment=263580) facilitates it.  again, we can discuss changing the default to NONE before making the threshold-edge-trigger property public; but what I don't want is a change in defaults that breaks some action with respect to others, just because ZoomAction and RotateAction are the ones you care about. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=710227#c11)  Emmanuele Bassi (:ebassi)    2013-12-05 14:08:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 263590](attachment.cgi?id=263590 "gesture: Make threshold-trigger-edge public") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=263590&action=edit "gesture: Make threshold-trigger-edge public") [[review]](review?bug=710227&attachment=263590) gesture: Make threshold-trigger-edge public  When the threshold-trigger-edge property was introduced in GestureAction, it was late in the cycle and I elected to keep it private, given the fact that nobody was subclassing GestureAction outside of Clutter itself.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c0)  ben    2015-05-25 15:34:01 UTC  ``` I gained access to locked session without password.  How to reproduce:   Login to your desktop with whatever user. Lock the session. Left click and hold the upward arrows that are displayed, and quickly move the mouse slightly up (don't let it to go fully up). Release the mouse. Repeat this procedure several more times, quickly.  This will result in a screen freeze for about 30 seconds.  Than you'll be granted full access to the session without entering the password.  It happened on both RHEL 7 and CentOS 7.  when entering the session in the RHEL, there is an error about a problem in the gnome-shell-3.8.4-31.el7 package, and in its details its saying that gnome-shell was crashed due to SIGSEGV ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c1)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-26 12:34:54 UTC  ``` Hi Ben,  I'm having trouble reproducing the crash. Can you tell me a few more things:  1) about how many times do you need to do it for the crash to happen? 2) do you wait for the arrows animation to be on screen before starting? 3) if you open a terminal and run abrt-cli list do you see a crash that mentions gnome-shell? 4) if so, can you go to the directory mentioned in that entry and grab the file sosreport.tar.xz and upload it here? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c2)  ben    2015-05-26 17:17:39 UTC  ``` Hi Ray,  1) Not many, about 2-4 times. 2) Yes I see the arrows and than "grab" them. 3) Yes I see gnome-shell crashes in abrt-cli 4) File is here: <http://www.filedropper.com/sosreporttar> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c3)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-26 20:07:58 UTC  ``` Hey Ben,  Thanks for the quick turnaround, it's very helpful.  From that same directory there are two other files:  1) coredump 2) core_backtrace  can you post those as well? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c4)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-26 20:12:32 UTC  ``` it may be a gnome-desktop idle monitor crasher ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c5)  ben    2015-05-26 20:54:23 UTC  ``` Hi Ray,  Both files are here: <http://www.filedropper.com/coredumpcorebacktrace>  Thanks! ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c6)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-27 19:59:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 304102](attachment.cgi?id=304102 "stack trace from core file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=304102&action=edit "stack trace from core file") stack trace from core file ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c7)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-27 20:06:26 UTC  ``` might be fixed by   <https://git.gnome.org/browse/clutter/commit/?h=clutter-1.18&id=97724939c8de004d7fa230f3ff64862d957f93a9>  Ben, are you using a physical mouse or a touch device? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c8)  ben    2015-05-28 11:47:49 UTC  ``` The RHEL is a VM which I'm using with a physical wireless mouse.  Now, thanks a lot for the fix, but how exactly do I use it? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c9)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-05-28 13:28:43 UTC  ``` Hi,  I don't actually know that [comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c7) is a fix, it's just a possibility. The backtrace is "after the fact", showing heap corruption, so it doesn't pinpoint the cause.  I also can't reproduce, despite spending some time trying.  I've built packages here with the above fix:  <https://people.gnome.org/~halfline/0f66bc5e62efc067e35d7d4f3b22b137/clutter-1.14.4-9.test.1/>  Mind giving them a try?  Also, what virtual machine software are you using? what platform is the host? Does the host have a touch screen? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c10)  ben    2015-05-31 17:36:26 UTC  ``` Ray it worked!! :-)  After installing the patched RPM I tried to reproduce the problem. I did get a 15 seconds freeze, but after that it went back to show the arrows animation and I couldn't get access to the session.  If you still want to know, I am using ESXi 5.5 on a white box server, managing it via the desktop vSphere client, and accessing the VMs via the console window in the vSphere client.  So big thanks to you for all your help, it is really appreciated :-) Ben ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c11)  ben    2015-05-31 17:37:52 UTC  ``` And there was no touch screen involved at any point. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c12)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-06-01 14:28:06 UTC  ``` Hi Ben,  Thanks for testing. This seems like a fairly serious issue and your help has been indispensable.  The reason I kept asking if there was somehow a touch device involved, is because the crasher that was fixed happens in touch event handling code, which left me a little puzzled at first.  Upon looking at the code closer, though, I see an explanation:      case CLUTTER_MOTION:â¢ ...     /* Follow same code path as a touch event update */â¢ â¢     case CLUTTER_TOUCH_UPDATE:â¢  The lack of a "break;" statement between the two case statements, means the problematic code is expected to run for normal mouse motion events as well.  This issue is already fixed in recent upstream versions of clutter, but I'm going to file a downstream bug report at bugzilla.redhat.com to track the issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c13)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-06-01 14:43:33 UTC  ``` I've filed <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1226965> to track this issue downstream. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c14)  ben    2015-06-01 16:27:42 UTC  ``` Thanks a lot again Ray, it was a really good experience working with you :) ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c15)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-06-02 16:30:30 UTC  ``` This bug has been assigned CVE-2015-3213 .  Opening bug up at the request of the Red Hat Security Response team ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=749847#c16)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2015-06-02 16:31:17 UTC  ``` Since this bug is already fixed in a stable version of clutter, closing ``` |  |
