  "cve": "CVE-2015-3213",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way clutter processed certain mouse and touch gestures. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the screen lock.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in Clutter's gesture handling code leads to a crash in some cases when the user performs gestures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of mouse and touch gestures in the Clutter library."
    ],
    "impact": "Screen lock bypass. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the screen lock, gaining unauthorized access to the user's session.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Performing specific mouse gestures on a locked screen."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the machine with a locked screen. The ability to manipulate a mouse or touch device to perform specific gestures."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was triggered due to a missing 'break' statement in the handling of touch events. This caused mouse events to trigger code intended for touch events, ultimately causing a crash due to memory corruption, which bypassed the screen lock. This was fixed upstream in clutter 1.16.2."
