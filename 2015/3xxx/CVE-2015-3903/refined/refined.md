  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2015-3903",
    "description": "libraries/Config.class.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.10, 4.2.x before 4.2.13.3, 4.3.x before 4.3.13.1, and 4.4.x before 4.4.6.1 disables X.509 certificate verification for GitHub API calls over SSL, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.",
    "affectedVersions": [
      "4.0.x before 4.0.10.10",
      "4.2.x before 4.2.13.3",
      "4.3.x before 4.3.13.1",
      "4.4.x before 4.4.6.1"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the phpMyAdmin code that handles API calls to GitHub. Specifically, it disables X.509 certificate verification for these calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Disabling X.509 certificate verification"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can exploit this vulnerability to spoof GitHub servers, potentially obtaining sensitive information transmitted during the API call.",
    "attackVector": "Network. A MITM attacker intercepts the communication between the phpMyAdmin server and the GitHub API.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the phpMyAdmin server and GitHub to perform a MITM attack. The attacker would also need to craft a malicious X.509 certificate.",

      "integrityImpact": "Partial",
      "availabilityImpact": "None"
    },
    "patch": "The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring proper X.509 certificate verification is enabled when calling the GitHub API. This involves removing the lines responsible for disabling SSL verification in `libraries/Config.class.php`.",
     "additionalInformation": [
        "The vulnerability is present in the `checkHTTP` function within `libraries/Config.class.php` where `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` are set to 0, effectively disabling SSL certificate verification.",
        "The fix involves removing these lines to ensure that SSL certificate verification is performed when making API calls to GitHub.",
        "The vulnerability was reported by Maksymilian Arciemowicz of cxsecurity.com.",
        "SUSE rates this vulnerability as having a moderate severity and states it does not affect SUSE products.",
         "Debian Security Advisory DSA-3382-1 also includes this fix in version 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u1 for jessie",
        "The fix is included in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.10.10, 4.2.13.3, 4.3.13.1, and 4.4.6.1 and later.",
        "The openSUSE-SU-2015:1191-1 security update addresses this CVE, along with CVE-2015-2206 and CVE-2015-3902."
