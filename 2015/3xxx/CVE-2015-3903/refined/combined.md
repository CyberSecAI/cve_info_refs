## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-2192.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-2221.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-2206 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2206)

#### Description

libraries/select\_lang.lib.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.9, 4.2.x before 4.2.13.2, and 4.3.x before 4.3.11.1 includes invalid language values in unknown-language error responses that contain a CSRF token and may be sent with HTTP compression, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct a BREACH attack and determine this token via a series of crafted requests.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=920773#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-03-05 06:21:11 UTC  ``` from package maintainer  <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2015-1.php>   PMASA-2015-1  Announcement-ID: PMASA-2015-1  Date: 2015-03-04 Summary  Risk of BREACH attack due to reflected parameter. Description  With a large number of crafted requests it was possible to infer the CSRF token by a BREACH attack. Severity  We consider this vulnerability to be non critical. Mitigation factor  This vulnerability can only be exploited in the presence of another vulnerability that allows the attacker to inject JavaScript into victim's browser.  Affected Versions  Versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.9), 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.13.2) and 4.3.x (prior to 4.3.11.1) are affected. Solution  Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.9 or newer, or 4.2.13.2 or newer, or 4.3.11.1 or newer, or apply the patch listed below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=930992#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-05-15 08:14:18 UTC  ``` <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2015-2.php>  Announcement-ID: PMASA-2015-2 Date: 2015-05-13 Summary: XSRF/CSRF vulnerability in phpMyAdmin setup. Description: By deceiving a user to click on a crafted URL, it is possible to alter the configuration file being generated with phpMyAdmin setup.  Severity: We consider this vulnerability to be non critical.  Mitigation factor: This vulnerability only affects the configuration file generation process and does not affect the effective configuration file. Moreover, the configuration file being generated is at risk only during the period when it's writable.  Affected Versions: Versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.10), 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.13.3), 4.3.x (prior to 4.3.13.1) and 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.6.1) are affected.  Solution: Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.10 or newer, or 4.2.13.3 or newer, or 4.3.13.1 or newer, or 4.4.6.1 or newer, or apply the patch listed below.
