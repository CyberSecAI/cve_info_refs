Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WebKit handles Content Security Policy (CSP) directives in conjunction with video controls and nested `IMG` elements within `OBJECT` elements. Specifically, the browser fails to properly enforce CSP rules when loading images within the described HTML structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Content Security Policy Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended protection of CSP. CSP is designed to prevent the browser from loading resources that are not explicitly whitelisted by a website, thus mitigating XSS and data injection attacks. This vulnerability allows for violation of this policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Violation:** An attacker can inject and load arbitrary images from an untrusted origin despite the CSP of the page which is an integrity violation of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Site:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted malicious website containing the vulnerable HTML structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require any special access or authentication, only the ability to host a malicious website or inject the malicious content into a web page.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to visit the malicious website using a vulnerable version of Safari or another application using the vulnerable version of WebKit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before 8.0.8. It also affects iOS before 8.4.1 and other products that use WebKit.
- The SUSE information indicates that this issue does not affect SUSE products, however they did provide a security update which included this fix in their webkit2gtk3 package, which is used in various openSUSE products.
- The Apple security advisory for Safari 8.0.8, 7.1.8, and 6.2.8 confirms the vulnerability and describes the fix as "improved Content Security Policy enforcement."
