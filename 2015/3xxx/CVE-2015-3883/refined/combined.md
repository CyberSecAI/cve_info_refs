### Challenge Coin 01

After attending Defcon 26 I got really hooked with the electronic badge challenge (I didn't get very far) and it was a great way of meeting and chatting to other people also excited about it and hacking in general. People there were trading trinkets and electronics there was a sense of community and gifting economy. I also received a DC801 challenge coin, and still think it's an awesome thing. So I decided to give it a go my self. It's just a little coin with a puzzle / challenge on it, but has my URL and email on it so can use as a kind of business card type thing. Really it's just a fun trinket. If you have one: good luck solving it. The best way to get one is to meet me IRL.
