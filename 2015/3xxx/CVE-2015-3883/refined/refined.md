Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-3883:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple Reflected & Persistent XSS

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding in various user-controlled fields within the qdPM 8.3 application.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Reflected XSS:**  User-supplied input in the search parameter and skin setting is directly reflected in the response without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Persistent XSS:** User-supplied input in fields like "Name of application", project names, task names, ticket names, discussion names, report names, and scheduler event names is stored in the database and displayed to other users without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows for persistent XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application. When a user clicks a malicious link or submits a crafted form, the injected script is executed in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
*   **Persistent XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be stored in the application's database. These scripts will be executed whenever another user views the affected page. This can lead to the attacker gaining persistent access to the user's session or account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** Through crafted URLs or form submissions.
*   **Persistent XSS:** By injecting malicious scripts via application forms, which are then stored and displayed to other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or use application forms to inject malicious scripts.
*   No special privileges are required; a regular user account is sufficient to exploit most of these XSS vulnerabilities.

**Specific attack examples (from the content):**

*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   `http://website.com/qdPM/index.php/users` POST with `search[keywords]=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
    *   `GET: /qdPM/index.php/skins?setSkin="><script>alert("XSS")</script>`
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   "Name of application" field within the configuration settings.
    *   Project, Task, Ticket, Discussion, Report, and Scheduler event names using `![](x)` or `"><script>alert("XSS")</script>` to inject scripts.
