Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-3799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a state management issue within password authentication for users who log in to OS X using their iCloud account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper State Management:** A flaw in how OS X manages authentication states allows for password changes without requiring the previous password.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the typical authentication process when changing a user's password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker with shell access (including Guest access) can change the password of a user without knowing the original password.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By changing the user's password, an attacker can then log in as the compromised user and execute arbitrary commands with that user's permissions.
*   **Root Access:** If the compromised user is an administrator, the attacker can gain root privileges, leading to complete system control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires shell access to the vulnerable system, which can be achieved through guest access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Shell Access:** The attacker needs shell access, which, according to ZDI, includes guest access, on the target OS X system.
*   **No Previous Password Required**: The attacker does not need to know the existing password of the target user.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Apple addressed the issue in OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 and Security Update 2015-006.
*   The CVSS score is 7.2, reflecting a high severity rating.
