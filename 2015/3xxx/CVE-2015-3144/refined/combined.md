## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Paras Sethia discovered that curl could incorrectly re-use NTLM HTTP

credentials when subsequently connecting to the same host over HTTP.

([CVE-2015-3143](/security/CVE-2015-3143))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled zero-length host names.

If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted

host name, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3144](/security/CVE-2015-3144))

Hanno Böck discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookie path elements.

If a user or automated system were tricked into parsing a specially crafted

cookie, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04.

([CVE-2015-3145](/security/CVE-2015-3145))

Isaac Boukris discovered that when using Negotiate authenticated

connections, curl could incorrectly authenticate the entire connection and

not just specific HTTP requests. ([CVE-2015-3148](/security/CVE-2015-3148))

Yehezkel Horowitz and Oren Souroujon discovered that curl sent HTTP headers

both to servers and proxies by default, contrary to expectations. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. ([CVE-2015-3153](/security/CVE-2015-3153))

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Alessandro Ghedini

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3144 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3148

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:

CVE-2015-3143

    NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests
    without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent
    over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is
    similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.

CVE-2015-3144

    When parsing URLs with a zero-length hostname (such as "<http://:80">;),
    libcurl would try to read from an invalid memory address. This could
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This
    issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid)
    distributions.

CVE-2015-3145

    When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's "path" element
    consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an
    invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the
    upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.

CVE-2015-3148

    When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method
    along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as
    authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for
    one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy13.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.42.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html) .

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2037108.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2037108.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 301 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2456979.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 16 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (October 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2445688.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2445688.1).

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 4 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite. 3 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2433477.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2433477.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

When doing HTTP requests NTLM authenticated, the entire connnection becomes authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works. This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the code. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further authentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.  libcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for re-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to pick a connection with matching credentials only.  If a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a specific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get re-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but without having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already authenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get sent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.  This problem is very similar to the previous problem known as [CVE-2014-0015](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20140129.html>). The main difference this time is that the subsequent request that wrongly re-use a connection doesn't ask for NTLM authentication.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3143 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.42.0 makes sure that a connection that is re-used also have to have a matching set of credentials if it would re-use a connection already using NTLM.  A patch for this problem is available at:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3143.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using NTLM with libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on February 24 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 16th.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

Together with each individual cookie there are several different properties, but for this vulnerability we focus on the associated "path" element. It tells information about for which path on a given host the cookies is valid.  The internal libcurl function called `sanitize_cookie_path()` that cleans up the path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that consisted of a single double-quote, libcurl would index a newly allocated memory area with index -1 and assign a zero to it, thus destroying heap memory it wasn't supposed to.  At best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have not researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this could be used for.  Applications have to explicitly enable cookie parsing in libcurl for this problem to trigger, and if not enabled libcurl will not hit this problem.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3145 to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.41.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.42.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.42.0 better verifies the input string.  A patch for this problem is available at [URL will be updated]:      <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3145.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.42.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using cookies with libcurl  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on April 16 2015. We contacted distros@openwall on April 17th.  libcurl 7.42.0 was released on April 22nd 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.
