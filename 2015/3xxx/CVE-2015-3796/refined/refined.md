Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2015-3796:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TRE regular expression engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when handling arbitrary-width hex literals within the TRE regex engine when the `REG_ENHANCED` flag is enabled. Specifically, a loop copies hex characters from the regex into a fixed-size (32 byte) stack buffer without verifying the length of the hex literal, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution due to stack corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted regular expression to an application using the vulnerable TRE library with the `REG_ENHANCED` flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the regular expression processed by the vulnerable application and be in a context that uses the `REG_ENHANCED` flag to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be local.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit-db content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) using grep as an example application.
- The vulnerability is present in OS X and iOS, affecting multiple components.
- The fix involves improved memory handling in the TRE library.

This vulnerability is addressed in OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 and Security Update 2015-006 as well as in iOS 8.4.1.
