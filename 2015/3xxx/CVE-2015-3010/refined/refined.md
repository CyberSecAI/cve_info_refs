{
  "CVE-2015-3010": {
    "Description": "The ceph-deploy utility, versions before 1.5.23, creates keyring files with world-readable permissions. When ceph-deploy is run as a dedicated non-root admin user, these keys become readable to other non-admin users on the system, leading to the disclosure of authentication credentials.",
    "Root cause": "The ceph-deploy utility did not explicitly set file permissions when creating keyring files, resulting in default permissions that made the files world-readable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default file permissions"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of Ceph authentication credentials to local users.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the affected system.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user who is not the designated administrator can read the keyring file and obtain authentication credentials."
  }
