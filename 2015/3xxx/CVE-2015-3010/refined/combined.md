| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-05 17:30:47 UTC  ``` After execution of ceph-deploy, ~ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring has mode 644 owned by ceph:users. The Key is a pre-shared key matching the one in /etc/ceph/ceph.clkient.admin.keyring on each non-admin node.  The attack scenario here is obviously if the user follows the documented ceph-deploy procedure by creating a dedicated admin user, he will create keys readable to all other (non-admin) users as well, thus leaking authentication credentials.  Could you check if this is an issue? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c4)  Owen Synge   2015-03-17 09:13:10 UTC  ``` I have made a simple patch for us.  Sadly patch does not cleanly apply to upstream but the code logic is unchanged. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c5)  Owen Synge   2015-03-17 13:24:51 UTC  ``` Made upstream pull request.  <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/pull/266>  Also resolved in storage 1:0 release. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c6)  Owen Synge   2015-03-18 12:11:05 UTC  ``` Done ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c8)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-24 14:05:48 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/commit/eee56770393bf19ed2dd5389226c6190c08dee3f> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c9)  Owen Synge   2015-04-08 11:15:18 UTC  ``` Closed ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c11)  Andreas Stieger   2015-06-01 08:25:23 UTC  ``` [bug 933028](show_bug.cgi?id=933028 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2015-4053: ceph-deploy admin command copies keyring file to /etc/ceph which is world readable") (CVE-2015-4053) came up and should be added to this update. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c12)  Nathan Cutler   2015-06-01 11:14:35 UTC  ``` Upstream merged Owen's patch in <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/pull/272> ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=920926#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-06-23 14:01:38 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:1102-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has 12 fixes is now available.

Before thsi fix to umask for keyring handling, After execution

of ceph-deploy, all keyrings have mode 644.

The documented ceph-deploy procedure by creating a dedicated

admin user, and keys will be readable to all other (non-admin)

users as well, thus leaking authentication credentials.

The fix uses umask to resolve the writing of keyfiles.

## Topic

An updated ceph-deploy package that fixes two security issues is now
available for Red Hat Ceph Storage.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
storage platform that combines the most stable version of Ceph with a Ceph
management platform, deployment tools, and support services.

It was discovered that ceph-deploy, a utility for deploying Red Hat Ceph
Storage, would create the keyring file with world readable permissions,
which could possibly allow a local user to obtain authentication
credentials from the keyring file. (CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)

All ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Message-ID: <55269CFA.1090406@suse.de>
Date: Thu, 09 Apr 2015 17:38:34 +0200
From: Andreas Stieger <astieger@...e.de>

Subject: CVE Request for ceph-deploy world-readable keyring permissions

Hello,

ceph-deploy 1.5.23 fixes an issue with world-readable permissions on a
keyring containing private key material.

The 1.5.23 changelog states:
"Fix an issue where keyring permissions were world readable"

The problem was that the keyring file would be created with 644 mode. If
ceph-deploy was run as a dedicated non-root admin user, the keys would
be readable to all other (non-admin) users of the same group, thus
leaking authentication credentials.

The upstream pull request and commits are:
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/pull/272>
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/commit/eee56770393bf19ed2dd5389226c6190c08dee3f>

References:

<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=920926>

Could I get a CVE ID assigned please?

Thanks
Andreas Stieger

Subject: Re: CVE Request for ceph-deploy world-readable keyring permissions

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> The 1.5.23 changelog states:
> "Fix an issue where keyring permissions were world readable"

> The problem was that the keyring file would be created with 644 mode. If
> ceph-deploy was run as a dedicated non-root admin user, the keys would
> be readable to all other (non-admin) users of the same group, thus
> leaking authentication credentials.

> <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/commit/eee56770393bf19ed2dd5389226c6190c08dee3f>

We were initially puzzled by "644 mode" in combination with "readable
to ... the same group." Possibly the unstated expectation is that user
home directories have 0750 permissions.

The security issue, in general, is that the file permissions are 644,
and the directory permissions (whatever they might be) do not
necessarily prevent read access to the file. Use CVE-2015-3010 for
this issue.
