  "CVE-2015-3042": {
    "Description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.281 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.169 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.457 on Linux allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-0347, CVE-2015-0350, CVE-2015-0352, CVE-2015-0353, CVE-2015-0354, CVE-2015-0355, CVE-2015-0360, CVE-2015-3038, CVE-2015-3041, and CVE-2015-3043.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the PCRE engine used in Flash, specifically in the handling of zero-length assertions with OP_BRAZERO. The insertion of the OP_BRAZERO shifts expected opcodes, leading to out-of-bounds bytecode execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Arbitrary bytecode execution",
        "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a special regex expression, a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the expression is evaluated by the vulnerable PCRE engine in Adobe Flash Player.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable PCRE engine in Flash to evaluate a maliciously crafted regex, which can be achieved remotely via a crafted SWF file."
