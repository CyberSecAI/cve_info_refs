Real conflict: Update was not prepared on top of previous update.  Technical conflict: Update was prepared on top of previous update, but OBS thinks, that it was not prepared on top of previous update.   I guess that it can even be considered as a minor bug of OBS:  I did a maintenance branch, and it provided correct files to me.  These files (exactly as they were) were propagated to another repository.  OBS complained not because there are some different files and conflicts, but just because the same files are now in a different repository.  While fixing it, I seen for the first time "osc ci" command, that successfully committed and no files were changed. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=905032#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-20 15:05:16 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2014:1465-1: An update that fixes 18 vulnerabilities is now available.

        This module exploits a buffer overflow on Adobe Flash Player when handling nellymoser

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c0)  Forgotten User \_3TOh92WgY   2013-12-19 18:14:54 UTC  ``` User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0  Hello,  I want to see videos from www.spiegel.de : no flash player  So I have downloaded the latest flash player.rpm from adobe and flash player runs fine.  But now opensuse will update flash player  which does not run first time on firefox. I allow this. On <http://www.adobe.com/de/software/flash/about/>  11,2,202,332 is indicated   It is anything OK?        Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c1)  Jacob W   2013-12-19 19:33:17 UTC  ``` flashplayer is included in openSUSE 13.1 in the official non-oss repository and works on www.spiegel.de (I tested with version 11.2.202.327-14.1).  You can do a 1-click install here: <http://software.opensuse.org/package/flash-player>  or just install through your package manager (YaST or zypper) assuming you have the non-oss repository active.  Before you install, remove the downloaded flashplayer you received from Adobe. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c2)  Stanislav Brabec   2014-01-02 18:21:20 UTC  ``` I cannot reproduce as well. Spiegel videos work correctly for me with openSUSE 13.1 Online Update flash-player.  The Flash Player plugin in openSUSE is exactly equal to the one from Adobe. Just the package format is converted to RPM and signed by SUSE.  Maybe you have something bad in your installation.  Could you reproduce it with a fresh account with no user data? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c3)  Forgotten User B-7XM5iatA   2014-03-05 23:17:02 UTC  ``` Unfortunately I've also problems with flash player and this independent of Adobe or openSuSE package. Flash player do not start.  I tried to start via terminal and got the message  WARNING: environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING set and it is not UTF-8 Ungültiger Maschinenbefehl  I checked this variable and got the output  echo $G_FILENAME_ENCODING @locale,UTF-8,ISO-8859-15,CP1252 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c4)  Stanislav Brabec   2014-03-07 15:27:39 UTC  ``` How did you reproduce this problem? Which browser and which web page?   This warning is well known and it is an Adobe fault.  G_FILENAME_ENCODING specifies possible encodings of files on the file system, and it is correctly formated:  It is a list: @locale: try current locale encoding first (most probably UTF-8)  UTF-8: try UTF-8 (it has effect only of your locale is not UTF-8)  ISO-8859-15: Most probable file name encoding for old UNIX and Linux systems in Germany.  CP1252 Most probable 8-bit file name encoding for old Windows file systems in Germany.  This setting makes possible to mount USB flash from nearly any source and don't care about file name encoding in GNOME.  Can you reproduce this problem without this setting?  e. g. from command line  G_FILENAME_ENCODING="" firefox ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c5)  Forgotten User B-7XM5iatA   2014-03-07 16:47:32 UTC  ``` I'm using seamonkey as web browser. If I try to play a video from a website (e. g. youtube) by using flashplayer, there is only an empty window shown.  Also the standalone player don't start. I tried to start the standalone player from command line and got the message:  WARNING: environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING set and it is not UTF-8 Ungültiger Maschinenbefehl   Now I tried to start standalone player from command line by typing: G_FILENAME_ENCODING="UTF-8" flashplayer  and got only the message  " Ungültiger Maschinenbefehl " without warning of environment variable.   After that I tried to start seamonkey from command line and got the error message:  (process:7515): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed  If seamonkey was started from command line and I tried to play a flash video by using flash plugin, I got the following error message at the terminal:  ###!!! [Parent][MessageChannel::Call] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c6)  Forgotten User B-7XM5iatA   2015-01-05 00:52:22 UTC  ``` Last week I installed openSuSE 13.1 on an other old Computer. Here the same problem with the flash player. Only a white empty window where flash player should play the video. Start of seamonkey via terminal show the known error messages:  ###!!! [Parent][MessageChannel::InterruptCall] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv ###!!! [Parent][MessageChannel::Call] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv ###!!!

[Parent][MessageChannel::InterruptCall] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv ###!!! [Parent][MessageChannel::InterruptCall] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv  Btw. recently I installed openSuSE 13.2 on my old computer, the same behave there.  I have no idea what the reason could be. On all other machines I installed openSuSE, flash player is working without problems.  Someone an idea how to find out why flash player don't work on this machines ? OS: openSuSE 13.1 and 13.2 ( i586 ) Browser: Seamonkey 2.31 Flashplayer: 11.2.202.425 ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c7)  Wolfgang Bauer   2015-01-05 13:47:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to Norman Gorlt from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c6)) > Someone an idea how to find out why flash player don't work on this machines > ? Flash-Player _requires_ SSE2 support since version 11. But certain older 32bit CPUs (in particular AMD Athlons and Semprons) do not have that.  "Ungültiger Maschinenbefehl" would indicate that this is indeed your problem.  "cat /proc/cpuinfo" will show you whether your CPU has SSE2 support or not (the "flags" line should include "sse2" if it is supported).  If your CPU does not support it, there's no way to get a current Flash-Player to work, your only option would be to install the ancient version 10 (e.g. download and install the package included in openSUSE 11.4). And since Flash-Player is closed-source, there's nothing openSUSE can do about that. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c8)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-05 14:06:28 UTC  ``` Thanks for the feedback.  Reporter's User-Agent is x86_64, but the bug itself is marked as bug for 32bit, so it could be an explanation.  There is no fix for this bug.  The only thing I can do about it is a a change: ExclusiveArch:  %ix86 x86_64 to ExclusiveArch:  i686 x86_64  But it cannot be done in maintained products, as it forces users to stick at old vulnerable version.  So we can do: - Do it only for Factory - Do it for all products, and release a dummy flash-player package for i586 that will completely remove it. (Well, Adobe support of NPAPI (i. e. Firefox on Linux) is going to expire soon, so we have to do it in future for all versions.)  We cannot provide 11.4 version for them. It is vulnerable and insecure. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c9)  Wolfgang Bauer   2015-01-05 14:32:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to Stanislav Brabec from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c8)) > Reporter's User-Agent is x86_64, but the bug itself is marked as bug for > 32bit, so it could be an explanation.  Well, the reporter apparently did get it to work with "the latest flash player.rpm from adobe", so probably did not have the same problem.  My reply was mainly directed at Norman Gorlt.  > There is no fix for this bug.  None that I can imagine.  > The only thing I can do about it is a a change: > ExclusiveArch:  %ix86 x86_64 > to > ExclusiveArch:  i686 x86_64  Wouldn't help at all I think. i686 does not imply SSE2 support, those affected CPUs are in fact i686 compatible AFAIK.  And, according to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2>, SSE2 was introduced by intel with the Pentium4 first, whereas i686 means PentiumPro IIANM. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c10)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-05 15:17:51 UTC  ``` Well, this is bad. => We cannot do it in RPM level.  Stephan: Is there any chance for update that behaves differently on SSE2 equipped machines and SSE2 unequipped machines?  Does ZYPP have a hardware tag that it could make it possible?  This update would need an additional RPM or ZYPP magic:  With SSE2: update from flash-player to new version of flash-player (possibly i686, preferably without asking for architecture change).  Without SSE2: update from flash-player to flash-player obsoleting package (e. g. flash-player-eol) or completely remove flash-player.   I would like to do it together with the next security update.  The easy hack solution, check in %pre which fails for SSE2-less machines, would violate contract, as it leave vulnerable packages on SSE2-less machines (and broken, as the current version already does not support SSE2).   Wolfgang Bauer: Maybe the original reporter downloaded SSE2 requiring version from Adobe. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c11)  Stephan Kulow   2015-01-05 15:29:30 UTC  ``` no zypp/rpm magic - if you prefer no flash over broken flash (you will get bug reports both ways IMO), do that check in %post and rm /usr/lib/browser-plugins/libflashplayer.so ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c12)  Forgotten User B-7XM5iatA   2015-01-06 02:01:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Bauer from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c7)) > Flash-Player _requires_ SSE2 support since version 11. > But certain older 32bit CPUs (in particular AMD Athlons and Semprons) do not > have that.  Thanks for quick answer.  One machine is working with an AMD Athlon XP 2500 ( Barton ) , the other one with an AMD Athlon XP 2400 ( Thorton ). Both CPU's do not support SSE2  Now I know the reason. It would never have occurred to me.  Tried for a test flash player 10.2 on the XP 2400 machine  and yes this version is working there. Of course not useable because of safety reasons.  Thank you once again Wolfgang for this important hint. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c14)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-01-14 19:00:26 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (856386) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/281323> Factory:NonFree / flash-player ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c15)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-14 20:06:52 UTC  ``` I created an update that deletes both binaries in case of SSE2-less CPU and it writes a message to stderr.  I cannot make it fail because transaction could be undone and system could stick with the old version. Package removal is not possible as well because the RPM database is locked by ZYPP trasaction.  It is an ugly hack that causes warnings in rpm -V, but it prevents invalid instruction exceptions in the browser.  I am afraid that we cannot do anything better. Maybe obsoleting empty package for i586, but it will not help for SSE2-less i686 CPUs anyway. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=856386#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-01-15 16:05:24 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:0052-1: An update that fixes 9 vulnerabilities is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=901334#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2014-10-15 12:59:33 UTC  ``` rh#1152775  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of casi32.  The issue lies in the failure to properly sanitize a user-supplied length value with a specific array implementation. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code within the context of the current process.

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-06
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-0346, CVE-2015-0347, CVE-2015-0348, CVE-2015-0349,
CVE-2015-0350, CVE-2015-0351, CVE-2015-0352, CVE-2015-0353, CVE-2015-0354,
CVE-2015-0355, CVE-2015-0356, CVE-2015-0358, CVE-2015-0359, CVE-2015-0360,
CVE-2015-3038, CVE-2015-3039, CVE-2015-3041, CVE-2015-3042, CVE-2015-3043)

A security bypass flaw was found in flash-plugin that could lead to the
disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2015-3044)

Two memory information leak flaws were found in flash-plugin that could
allow an attacker to potentially bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization) protection, and make it easier to exploit other flaws.
(CVE-2015-0357, CVE-2015-3040)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.457.
