Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how `stunnel` handles SSL/TLS session reuse in conjunction with the "redirect" option and certificate-based authentication. Specifically, when the "redirect" option is configured, only the initial connection is redirected to the specified host. Subsequent connections that reuse existing SSL/TLS sessions bypass the intended client certificate authentication and are instead forwarded to the host(s) specified by the "connect" option, which is supposed to happen only on successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the client certificate authentication mechanism when the "redirect" option is used and session reuse occurs.
*   **Improper Session Handling:** `stunnel` does not correctly manage the session state in the context of the "redirect" option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to services or systems that were intended to be protected by client certificate authentication.
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation**: This bypass could potentially allow access to sensitive data or the ability to manipulate resources on the backend systems specified by "connect".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** This vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **SSL/TLS Session Reuse:** The attack relies on exploiting reused SSL/TLS sessions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable `stunnel` server.
*   **Untrusted Certificate**: The attacker must possess a client certificate which would normally be rejected by the server.
*   **Ability to initiate connections** The attacker must initiate the initial connection which then is redirected.

**Conditions for Exploitability:**

*   **Vulnerable Stunnel Versions:** `stunnel` versions 5.00 to 5.13 inclusive are affected.
*   **Server Mode:** `stunnel` must be running in server mode with `client = no`.
*   **Certificate-Based Authentication:**  Certificate-based authentication must be enabled with `verify = 2` or higher.
*   **"redirect" Option:** The `redirect` option must be in use.
*   **Session reuse:** The attacker needs to trigger a session reuse.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** The recommended solution is to upgrade to `stunnel` version 5.14 or later.
*   **Configuration Change:** Alternatively, removing the `redirect` option from the configuration file will prevent the vulnerability from being exploitable.

**CVSS v2 Score:**
*   CVSS Base Score: 6.4
*   CVSS Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
