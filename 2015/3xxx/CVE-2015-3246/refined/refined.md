{
  "CVE-2015-3246": {
    "description": "The libuser library directly modifies /etc/passwd, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (inconsistent file state) by causing an error during the modification. This issue can be combined with CVE-2015-3245 to gain privileges.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "libuser modifies /etc/passwd directly instead of using a temporary copy and renaming it after changes, which can lead to an inconsistent file state if an error occurs during modifications.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Direct modification of critical system file /etc/passwd.",
        "Lack of proper error handling during file modifications.",
          "Inconsistent locking mechanism compared to other tools managing /etc/passwd file. libuser uses fcntl() locks which are not compatible with  lckpwdf() locks used by shadow-utils and util-linux."
      ],
       "impact": "Local users can cause a denial-of-service by triggering errors during /etc/passwd modifications by libuser. This vulnerability combined with CVE-2015-3245 allows for local privilege escalation to root.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to a system with a vulnerable libuser.",
        "Manipulating user's GECOS field using userhelper/chfn with specific inputs to cause an error during libuser operation."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Local shell access.",
        "Ability to execute programs compiled against the vulnerable libuser library (like userhelper)."
