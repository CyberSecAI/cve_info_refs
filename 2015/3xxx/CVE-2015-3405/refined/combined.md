## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd
service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query
and configure the ntpd service.

It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source IP
address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send
malicious control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses.
(CVE-2014-9298, CVE-2014-9751)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP hosts that were peering
with each other authenticated themselves before updating their internal
state variables. An attacker could send packets to one peer host, which
could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization process among
the reached peers. (CVE-2015-1799)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric
keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to
guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to spoof an NTP client
or server. (CVE-2015-3405)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey protocol
was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret received from an NTP
server, it could cause that client to crash. (CVE-2014-9297, CVE-2014-9750)

It was found that ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured to use
symmetric cryptographic keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this
flaw to send crafted packets that would be accepted by a client or a peer
without the attacker knowing the symmetric key. (CVE-2015-1798)

The CVE-2015-1798 and CVE-2015-1799 issues were discovered by Miroslav
Lichvár of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* The ntpd service truncated symmetric keys specified in the key file to 20

bytes. As a consequence, it was impossible to configure NTP authentication
to work with peers that use longer keys. With this update, the maximum key
length has been changed to 32 bytes. (BZ#1191111)

* The ntpd service could previously join multicast groups only when

starting, which caused problems if ntpd was started during system boot
before network was configured. With this update, ntpd attempts to join
multicast groups every time network configuration is changed. (BZ#1207014)

* Previously, the ntp-keygen utility used the exponent of 3 when generating

RSA keys. Consequently, generating RSA keys failed when FIPS mode was
enabled. With this update, ntp-keygen has been modified to use the exponent
of 65537, and generating keys in FIPS mode now works as expected.
(BZ#1191116)

* The ntpd service dropped incoming NTP packets if their source port was

lower than 123 (the NTP port). With this update, ntpd no longer checks the
source port number, and clients behind NAT are now able to correctly
synchronize with the server. (BZ#1171640)

Enhancements:

* This update adds support for configurable Differentiated Services Code

Points (DSCP) in NTP packets, simplifying configuration in large networks
where different NTP implementations or versions are using different DSCP
values. (BZ#1202828)

* This update adds the ability to configure separate clock stepping

thresholds for each direction (backward and forward). Use the "stepback"
and "stepfwd" options to configure each threshold. (BZ#1193154)

* Support for nanosecond resolution has been added to the Structural

Health Monitoring (SHM) reference clock. Prior to this update, when a
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) hardware clock was used as a time source to
synchronize the system clock, the accuracy of the synchronization was
limited due to the microsecond resolution of the SHM protocol. The
nanosecond extension in the SHM protocol now allows sub-microsecond
synchronization of the system clock. (BZ#1117702)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1210324#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-09 13:13:28 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems. This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server.  If the lowest byte of the temp variable is outside of the printable characters range (between 0x20 and 0x7f), the ntp-keygen utility enters an infinite loop. However, if the temp variable is within the aforementioned range, the generated MD5 key will consist of 20 identical characters, meaning only 93 possible keys can be generated.

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-3395.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-3406.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-3405 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3405)

#### Description

ntp-keygen in ntp 4.2.8px before 4.2.8p2-RC2 and 4.3.x before 4.3.12 does not generate MD5 keys with sufficient entropy on big endian machines when the lowest order byte of the temp variable is between 0x20 and 0x7f and not #, which might allow remote attackers to obtain the value of generated MD5 keys via a brute force attack with the 93 possible keys.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

The flaw would give them the new ability to > (sometimes) launch a CPU consumption attack. However, we have not > actually heard of anyone with a web-based ntp-keygen arrangement, so > we currently don't want to assign a CVE ID for that. >  >     the fact that >     ntp-keygen generates non-random keys is.

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with another referenced time source.

It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source IP
address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send malicious
control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses.
(CVE-2014-9298)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP hosts that were peering
with each other authenticated themselves before updating their internal
state variables. An attacker could send packets to one peer host, which
could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization process among
the reached peers. (CVE-2015-1799)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric
keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to
guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to spoof an NTP client
or server. (CVE-2015-3405)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey protocol
was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret received from an NTP
server, it could cause that client to crash. (CVE-2014-9297)

It was found that ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured to use
symmetric cryptographic keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this
flaw to send crafted packets that would be accepted by a client or a peer
without the attacker knowing the symmetric key. (CVE-2015-1798)

The CVE-2015-1798 and CVE-2015-1799 issues were discovered by Miroslav
Lichvár of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* The ntpd daemon truncated symmetric keys specified in the key file to 20

bytes. As a consequence, it was impossible to configure NTP authentication
to work with peers that use longer keys. The maximum length of keys has now
been changed to 32 bytes. (BZ#1053551)

* The ntp-keygen utility used the exponent of 3 when generating RSA keys,

and generating RSA keys failed when FIPS mode was enabled. ntp-keygen has
been modified to use the exponent of 65537, and generating keys in FIPS
mode now works as expected. (BZ#1184421)

* The ntpd daemon included a root delay when calculating its root

dispersion. Consequently, the NTP server reported larger root dispersion
than it should have and clients could reject the source when its distance
reached the maximum synchronization distance (1.5 seconds by default).
Calculation of root dispersion has been fixed, the root dispersion is now
reported correctly, and clients no longer reject the server due to a large
synchronization distance. (BZ#1045376)

* The ntpd daemon dropped incoming NTP packets if their source port was

lower than 123 (the NTP port). Clients behind Network Address Translation
(NAT) were unable to synchronize with the server if their source port was
translated to ports below 123. With this update, ntpd no longer checks the
source port number. (BZ#1171630)

Enhancements:

* This update introduces configurable access of memory segments used for

Shared Memory Driver (SHM) reference clocks. Previously, only the first two
memory segments were created with owner-only access, allowing just two SHM
reference clocks to be used securely on a system. Now, the owner-only
access to SHM is configurable with the "mode" option, and it is therefore
possible to use more SHM reference clocks securely. (BZ#1122015)

* Support for nanosecond resolution has been added to the SHM reference

clock. Prior to this update, when a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) hardware
clock was used as a time source to synchronize the system clock (for
example, with the timemaster service from the linuxptp package), the
accuracy of the synchronization was limited due to the microsecond
resolution of the SHM protocol. The nanosecond extension in the SHM
protocol now enables sub-microsecond synchronization of the system clock.
(BZ#1117704)

## Solution

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing the update, the ntpd daemon will
restart automatically.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

References: Sec 2779 / CVE-2015-1798 / VU#374268     Affects: All NTP4 releases starting with ntp-4.2.5p99 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric keys to authenticate remote associations.     CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4     Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015     Summary: When ntpd is configured to use a symmetric key to authenticate a remote NTP server/peer, it checks if the NTP message authentication code (MAC) in received packets is valid, but not if there actually is any MAC included. Packets without a MAC are accepted as if they had a valid MAC. This allows a MITM attacker to send false packets that are accepted by the client/peer without having to know the symmetric key. The attacker needs to know the transmit timestamp of the client to match it in the forged reply and the false reply needs to reach the client before the genuine reply from the server. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be relaying the packets between the client and the server.      Authentication using autokey doesn't have this problem as there is a check that requires the key ID to be larger than NTP_MAXKEY, which fails for packets without a MAC.     Mitigation:         Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page         Configure ntpd with enough time sources and monitor it properly.      Credit: This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar, of Red Hat.   Authentication doesn't protect symmetric associations against DoS attacks.      References: Sec 2781 / CVE-2015-1799 / VU#374268     Affects: All NTP releases starting with at least xntp3.3wy up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p2 where the installation uses symmetric key authentication.     CVSS: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) Base Score: 5.4     Note: the CVSS base Score for this issue could be 4.3 or lower, and it could be higher than 5.4.     Date Resolved: Stable (4.2.8p2) 07 Apr 2015     Summary: An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with each other (symmetric association) can send a packet to host A with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables on A to the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send on its next poll to B a packet with originate timestamp that doesn't match the transmit timestamp of B and the packet will be dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for both hosts, they won't be able to synchronize to each other. This is a known denial-of-service attack, described at <https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/onwire.html> .      According to the document the NTP authentication is supposed to protect symmetric associations against this attack, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The state variables are updated even when authentication fails and the peers are sending packets with originate timestamps that don't match the transmit timestamps on the receiving side.      This seems to be a very old problem, dating back to at least xntp3.3wy. It's also in the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) and NTPv4 (RFC 5905) specifications, so other NTP implementations with support for symmetric associations and authentication may be vulnerable too. An update to the NTP RFC to correct this error is in-process.     Mitigation:         Upgrade to 4.2.8p2, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page         Note that for users of autokey, this specific style of MITM attack is simply a long-known potential problem.         Configure ntpd with appropriate time sources and monitor ntpd. Alert your staff if problems are detected.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

This is the same byte on little-endian machines, but on big endian machines the wrong end of the integer is extracted over and over again. If this byte is rejected, the program is trapped in an infinite loop; if the byte is accepted as a random byte, the program terminates but the byte sequence is probably anything but random. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2797#c1)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-03-30 18:18:54 UTC  ``` The repo is in    psp.ntp.org:~perlinger/ntp-stable-2797 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2797#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2015-04-02 03:23:21 UTC  ``` Pearly,  Thanks for the report and fix.  Please check 4.3.12 or 4.2.8p2-RC2 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or IN_PROGRESS, as appropriate. ``` |  |

# CVE-2015-1799

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1798.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1802.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1799 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1799)

#### Description

The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain invalid packets, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1210324#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-09 13:13:28 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems. This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server.  If the lowest byte of the temp variable is outside of the printable characters range (between 0x20 and 0x7f), the ntp-keygen utility enters an infinite loop. However, if the temp variable is within the aforementioned range, the generated MD5 key will consist of 20 identical characters, meaning only 93 possible keys can be generated.  Upstream bug:  <https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2797>  Upstream patch:  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-stable/?PAGE=patch&REV=55199296N2gFqH1Hm5GOnhrk9Ypygg>  CVE request:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/85>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1210324#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-09 13:15:03 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1210327](show_bug.cgi?id=1210327 "CLOSED ERRATA - ntp: ntp-keygen may generate non-random symmetric keys on big-endian systems [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1210324#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-04-10 05:04:18 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Package        : ntp
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1798 CVE-2015-1799
Debian Bug     : 782095

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ntp, an implementation of the
Network Time Protocol:

CVE-2015-1798

    When configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would
    accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could
    allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send
    malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.

CVE-2015-1799

    When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
    association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before
    the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
    between NTP peers.

Additionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen
on big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate
non-random keys.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

> * [Bug 2797] ntp-keygen trapped in endless loop for MD5 keys on big-endian machines.
> <https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2797>

> Patch: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-stable/?PAGE=patch&REV=55199296N2gFqH1Hm5GOnhrk9Ypygg>

> While the endless loop is not a security flaw per se

The unstated rationale here seems to be "ntp-keygen is a command-line
program that is not normally exposed in a way that crosses privilege
boundaries."

The documentation mentions:

  After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates
  from time to time, if only to extend the validity interval.
  Simply run
  @code{ntp-keygen}
  with the same flags as before to generate new certificates

It seems plausible that some sites may have created a web interface so
that operations staff can occasionally do a certificate update (maybe
with a new key), but these staff don't have login access to the
machine running NTP. The flaw would give them the new ability to
(sometimes) launch a CPU consumption attack. However, we have not
actually heard of anyone with a web-based ntp-keygen arrangement, so
we currently don't want to assign a CVE ID for that.

> the fact that
> ntp-keygen generates non-random keys is. If the lowest byte of the temp

> possible keys can be generated.

Use CVE-2015-3405 for this code error that results in a key space
that's much smaller than expected.
