Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-3405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ntp-keygen` utility, specifically how it generates MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Entropy:** The key generation process on big-endian systems doesn't produce truly random keys.
    *   If the lowest byte of a temporary variable used in key generation falls within the range of printable characters (0x20-0x7f), and is not '#', `ntp-keygen` produces MD5 keys consisting of 20 identical characters. This severely reduces the key space to just 93 possible keys.
    *   The generation of MD5 keys does not properly use the random byte, especially on big-endian systems, which results in a predictable output that reduces the key space

*   **Infinite Loop:** If the random byte is outside of the printable characters range, the utility enters an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Key Guessing:** Attackers could exploit the lack of entropy to guess the generated MD5 keys via brute force.
*   **Spoofing:** Successfully guessed MD5 keys could allow an attacker to spoof an NTP client or server, potentially disrupting time synchronization or injecting malicious time data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can gain access to the generated keys, either by knowing them or predicting the keys that will be generated.
*   The vulnerability could be exploited using a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be in a position to either:
    *   Capture or be present at the key generation process
    *   Be able to perform a man in the middle attack.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The issue affects systems using `ntp-keygen` on big-endian architectures.
*   Red Hat considers the vulnerability as having a "Moderate" impact (RHSA-2015:1459, RHSA-2015:2231).
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in `ntp` versions 4.2.6p5-5.el6 (RHEL 6) and 4.2.6p5-22.el7 (RHEL 7).
*   SUSE also addressed this issue for its products (SUSE-SU-2015:0865-1, SUSE-SU-2015:1173-1)
*   Oracle Linux also mentioned the vulnerability in its bulletin(Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015)

**Summary:**
CVE-2015-3405 describes a vulnerability in the key generation routine of ntp-keygen where, on big-endian systems, it either produces a non-random key or enters into an infinite loop.  This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to potentially guess the keys and perform spoofing attacks.
