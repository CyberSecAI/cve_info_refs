Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-3824

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow when handling MPEG4 tx3g atoms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The sum of 'size' and 'chunk_size' variables can exceed 2^32, causing an integer overflow.
- The resulting incorrect value from the integer overflow is used to allocate a buffer, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.
- This undersized buffer allocation can later lead to a heap corruption when the data is written to the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on affected Android devices.
- Potential heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted multimedia message containing the malicious MPEG4 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send a malicious multimedia message to the target device.
- No user interaction is required, the device will automatically download and parse the malicious message.
