{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The KCodes NetUSB kernel driver does not properly validate the length of the computer name provided by a connecting client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (device crash/reboot) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "An unauthenticated attacker on the local network can exploit this vulnerability.",
        "Some device default configurations may allow a remote attacker as well."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the device on port 20005. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."

  ],
   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability lies within the `run_init_sbus()` function of the NetUSB kernel module.  The affected code receives the length of the computer name from a network message and uses it to copy the provided computer name to a stack-allocated buffer without adequate size checking.\n\nExploits for this vulnerability have been made public, including a denial-of-service exploit and a more advanced exploit for remote code execution on MIPS based devices."
