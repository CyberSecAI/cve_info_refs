The provided document contains information about security updates for OS X Yosemite v10.10.4 and Security Update 2015-005. It includes a description of CVE-2015-3675.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default Apache configuration did not include mod\_hfs\_apple. If Apache was manually enabled and the configuration was not changed, some files that should not be accessible might have been accessible using a specially crafted URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. The vulnerability arises from the default Apache configuration not including the `mod_hfs_apple` module. This omission allows an attacker to potentially bypass HTTP authentication and access protected directories using specially crafted URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to access directories that are protected with HTTP authentication without knowing the correct credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL targeting the improperly configured Apache web server on the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not need valid credentials for the target resource.
