The provided content relates to CVE-2015-3967.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Janitza UMG devices' web interface lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the web interface does not validate if web requests are originating from the user's authenticated browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can execute actions on behalf of an authenticated user. This can lead to the attacker manipulating device settings, measurement values, and/or functionalities. The overall impact is a compromise of availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the device and dependent systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is initiated by tricking an authenticated user into accessing a malicious web page controlled by the attacker while the user is actively logged into the UMG device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to trick a user, who is authenticated to the device, into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link.
The attacker does not require prior authentication or privileged access to the device to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
