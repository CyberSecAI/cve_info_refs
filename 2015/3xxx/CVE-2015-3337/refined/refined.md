Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-3337

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to improper handling of site plugins in the Elasticsearch search engine, specifically a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Directory Traversal:** The core vulnerability is a directory traversal issue, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended plugin directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the directory traversal flaw. This can expose sensitive information, configuration files, credentials, or other critical data.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the Elasticsearch server. These requests target the `/_plugin/` endpoint and use directory traversal sequences like `../` to navigate to arbitrary files.
* The exploit code provides a python script as an attack vector: it connects to an Elasticsearch server and sends GET requests containing directory traversal sequences in the URL to access files outside the intended plugin directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Elasticsearch server.
* **Knowledge of plugin paths:** While not explicitly required for the basic exploit, knowledge of installed plugins can facilitate the exploit, allowing to test different paths.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.5.2 and 1.4.5 are vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Availability:** Public exploits are available, including a Python script on GitHub.
*   **Mitigation:**  The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading to Elasticsearch version 1.5.2 or 1.4.5 or later.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was discovered by John Heasman of DocuSign.
*   **Vendor Advisory:** Elastic has released security advisories (ESA) for the vulnerability. Debian also released a security advisory (DSA 3241-1)
