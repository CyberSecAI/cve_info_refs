Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2015-3300 lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the TheCartPress WordPress plugin. Specifically, multiple HTTP POST parameters related to "Shipping address" and "Billing address" during the checkout process are not sanitized before being stored in the database. Additionally, several GET parameters used in admin pages are not sanitized before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized user inputs during checkout (billing and shipping address fields) lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code via these fields, which is then stored in the database. This malicious code is later executed when the order information is viewed.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in various admin pages due to the lack of sanitization of GET parameters such as `search_by`, `address_id`, `address_name`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `street`, `city`, `postcode`, `email`, `post_id`, `rel_type`, and `post_type`. An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when clicked by an administrator, will execute arbitrary script code in the context of the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of users accessing the vulnerable pages, allowing for potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By injecting malicious scripts, attackers could potentially manipulate data displayed on the site or perform actions on behalf of other users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can inject malicious script code that will be executed by administrator users accessing the affected admin pages. This can lead to privilege escalation by exploiting the administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Checkout Form:** An attacker can inject malicious code by submitting a crafted checkout form with malicious content in the billing or shipping address fields. This attack doesn't require authentication.
*   **Malicious Links:** Attackers can craft malicious links with payloads within vulnerable GET parameters and trick administrators into clicking them. This attack requires social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** For the stored XSS vulnerabilities within checkout forms, the attacker does not require any specific privileges on the WordPress installation.
*   **Social Engineering (for reflected XSS):** For reflected XSS vulnerabilities in admin pages, the attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link.
