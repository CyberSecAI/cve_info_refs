Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of "Fields" within PDF documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A dangling pointer is reused after the memory it points to has been freed. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process (the user running Adobe Acrobat/Reader). This means the attacker can gain control of the system, potentially installing malware, stealing data, or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF document containing malicious "Fields".
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious PDF document using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Reader/Acrobat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs the technical skill to create a PDF document that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of the "Fields".
- **Social Engineering/Distribution:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious PDF to the target user, this could be via email, website download, or other methods.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the way the application handles the 'Fields' data within a PDF file.
*   The Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS has a filter (ID: 19493) to protect against this specific vulnerability.
*   Adobe has released updates to fix the vulnerability, urging users to upgrade to the latest versions.
