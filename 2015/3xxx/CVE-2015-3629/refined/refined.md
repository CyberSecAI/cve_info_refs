Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-3629:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from changes introduced in Libcontainer version 1.6.0, specifically related to how mount namespaces were handled during container respawn.
- This allowed a symlink traversal that enabled a malicious container to escape containerization and write files to the host system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Symlink traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to perform symlink traversal during container respawn.
- **Mount namespace breakout:** The vulnerability enables a malicious container to break out of its mount namespace.
- **Insecure file writing:** This breakout allows arbitrary file writes on the host system from within a container.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Local privilege escalation:** By writing to arbitrary files on the host system, attackers can achieve local privilege escalation.
- **Escape containerization:** A container can break free from its intended isolation and directly interact with the host.
- **Host compromise:** Arbitrary file writes can potentially lead to the complete compromise of the host system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious container images:** The attack vector is through malicious Dockerfiles or container images.
- **Container respawn:** The vulnerability is triggered when a container is respawned.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local user:** A local user with the ability to run containers with a malicious image can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Untrusted images:** The attacker needs to use an untrusted image they have crafted.

**Additional Details**
