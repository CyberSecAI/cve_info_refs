- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The firmware contains a hard-coded password for a high-privileged user accessible through the serial console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the device's serial console can gain full control over the device due to the hardcoded high-privileged user credentials, allowing them to read and modify all data and configurations on the device, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device's serial console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the serial console and knowledge of the hard-coded password.
