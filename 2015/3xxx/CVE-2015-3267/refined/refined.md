```
Root cause of vulnerability: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on a JBoss Operations Network 404 error page.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the 404 error page. This could lead to session fixation attacks, allowing the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, potentially resulting in compromised integrity of secure data, viewing/altering user records, and performing transactions as that user.
Attack vectors: By enticing a user to click on a malicious URL, the user could be redirected to a vulnerable 404 error page, triggering the XSS vulnerability.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL. No specific attacker position is specified beyond that.
