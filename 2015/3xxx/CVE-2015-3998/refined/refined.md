Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3998:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `phpwhois` component included in the `adsense-click-fraud-monitoring` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `query` parameter in the `whois.php` script is directly used in the output without escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The `$_GET['query']` parameter is taken directly from the URL, included in the response, and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser when they visit a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `query` parameter.
*   **Potential for Malicious Activities:** This can allow the attacker to perform various malicious actions including, but not limited to:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites
    *   Modifying the content of the page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `query` parameter of the `whois.php` script and tricks users into clicking on it. For example, `http://www.vapidlabs.internal/wp-content/plugins/adsense-click-fraud-monitoring/phpwhois/whois.php?query=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&output=nice`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade a user to click on the malicious URL. This can be done through various social engineering techniques, such as embedding the URL in a malicious email or website.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerable plugin is no longer available for download from the WordPress Plugin Directory and was closed on April 24, 2015 for an unknown reason.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `phpwhois` component, specifically `whois.php`.
*   The advisory notes the specific vulnerable file paths and parameters.
*   The exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a simple JavaScript alert.
