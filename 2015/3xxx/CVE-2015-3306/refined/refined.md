Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `mod_copy` module in ProFTPD, specifically the lack of authentication requirements for the `SITE CPFR` (copy from) and `SITE CPTO` (copy to) commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated File Copy:** The primary weakness is that the `mod_copy` module allows any unauthenticated user to use the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands. This allows them to copy files from anywhere on the server's filesystem to any writable location.
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** By exploiting the above weakness, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server and write arbitrary content to any directory they have write permissions to through the FTP service.
- **Remote Command Execution:** The attacker can upload a malicious PHP script to a publicly accessible web directory, and then execute the script by browsing to it with a web browser, achieving Remote Code Execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and copy them to locations that they have access to.
- **Data Modification/Manipulation:** Attackers can overwrite legitimate files with malicious ones, potentially leading to system compromise, and also write arbitrary data anywhere that the FTP service has write permission.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and executing malicious scripts (e.g. PHP), attackers can gain control of the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the server, with attackers being able to execute arbitrary commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is via the FTP protocol, specifically through the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands.
- No prior authentication is required, and the commands can be sent remotely.
- The vulnerability can be exploited over the network via port 21, the default FTP port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FTP server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid username or password to connect to the FTP server or issue the malicious commands.
- **Knowledge of Target Paths:** To successfully exploit this, the attacker needs to have knowledge about the path of files they want to copy as well as a writable web directory.

In summary, the vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to copy any file on the server to a location they can write to. It also allows the attacker to write malicious code to the target server, and execute it to gain full system compromise.
