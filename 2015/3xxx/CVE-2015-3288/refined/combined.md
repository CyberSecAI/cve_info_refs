| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=979021#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2016-05-09 08:59:49 UTC  ``` rh#1333830    References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333830> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3288> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3288> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=979021#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2016-05-09 12:38:31 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that there is a way to arbitrary change zero page memory. Zero page is a page which kernel maps into virtual address space on read page fault if the page was not allocated before. Kernel has one zero page which used everywhere. Programs that map 0 page are affected and code execution can be gained. Upon running the exploit the system may become unusable as the linker memory pages gets tainted. Furthermore, if the right code is put in the 0 page, code execution is possible.  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6b7339f4c31ad69c8e9c0b2859276e22cf72176d> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=979021#c3)  Michal Hocko   2016-05-13 08:58:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=979021#c1)) > A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that > there is a way to arbitrary change zero page memory.

All non-anon vmas _should_ and the vast majority _have_ vm_ops defined. So we are talking about broken drivers which do not follow the general rules.  Certain special mappings do not have vm_ops but they do not fault either so they should be mostly OK - well as b53306285466 ("mm: introduce vma_is_anonymous(vma) helper") notes "     special_mapping_fault() is absolutely broken.

x86/mpx: Do not set ->vm\_ops on MPX VMAs
commit a89652769470d12cd484ee3d3f7bde0742be8d96 upstream.
MPX setups private anonymous mapping, but uses vma->vm\_ops too.
This can confuse core VM, as it relies on vm->vm\_ops to
distinguish file VMAs from anonymous.
As result we will get SIGBUS, because handle\_pte\_fault() thinks
it's file VMA without vm\_ops->fault and it doesn't know how to
handle the situation properly.
Let's fix that by not setting ->vm\_ops.
We don't really need ->vm\_ops here: MPX VMA can be detected with
VM\_MPX flag. And vma\_merge() will not merge MPX VMA with non-MPX
VMA, because ->vm\_flags won't match.
The only thing left is name of VMA. I'm not sure if it's part of
ABI, or we can just drop it. The patch keep it by providing
arch\_vma\_name() on x86.

mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mapping
commit 6b7339f4c31ad69c8e9c0b2859276e22cf72176d upstream.
Reading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
the VMA doesn't have vm\_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
do\_anonymous\_page().
Let's change page fault handler to use do\_anonymous\_page() only on
anonymous VMA (->vm\_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
shared.
For file mappings without vm\_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm\_ops,
page fault on pte\_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.

Fix firmware loader uevent buffer NULL pointer dereference
commit 6f957724b94cb19f5c1c97efd01dd4df8ced323c upstream.
The firmware class uevent function accessed the "fw\_priv->buf" buffer
without the proper locking and testing for NULL. This is an old bug
(looks like it goes back to 2012 and commit 1244691c73b2: "firmware
loader: introduce firmware\_buf"), but for some reason it's triggering
only now in 4.2-rc1.
Shuah Khan is trying to bisect what it is that causes this to trigger
more easily, but in the meantime let's just fix the bug since others are
hitting it too (at least Ingo reports having seen it as well).

With commit: e1e455f4f4d3 (perf tools: Work around lack of sched\_getcpu

With the above commit, sched\_getcpu always seems to return -1. The
intention of commit e1e455f was to add a sched\_getcpu in glibc < 2.6.
Hence keep the sched\_getcpu definition under an ifdef.

arm64: Don't report clear pmds and puds as huge
commit fd28f5d439fca77348c129d5b73043a56f8a0296 upstream.
The current pmd\_huge() and pud\_huge() functions simply check if the table
bit is not set and reports the entries as huge in that case. This is
counter-intuitive as a clear pmd/pud cannot also be a huge pmd/pud, and
it is inconsistent with at least arm and x86.
To prevent others from making the same mistake as me in looking at code
that calls these functions and to fix an issue with KVM on arm64 that
causes memory corruption due to incorrect page reference counting
resulting from this mistake, let's change the behavior.

Upper bits should be zeroed in endianness conversion:
- even when there's no need to change endianness (i.e., BPF\_FROM\_BE
on big endian or BPF\_FROM\_LE on little endian);
- after rev16.
This patch fixes such bugs by emitting extra instructions to clear

arm64: bpf: fix out-of-bounds read in bpf2a64\_offset()
commit 8eee539ddea09bccae2426f09b0ba6a18b72b691 upstream.
Problems occur when bpf\_to or bpf\_from has value prog->len - 1 (e.g.,
"Very long jump backwards" in test\_bpf where the last instruction is a
jump): since ctx->offset has length prog->len, ctx->offset[bpf\_to + 1]
or ctx->offset[bpf\_from + 1] will cause an out-of-bounds read, leading
to a bogus jump offset and kernel panic.
This patch moves updating ctx->offset to after calling build\_insn(),
and changes indexing to use bpf\_to and bpf\_from without + 1.

v3.18 changed handle\_IRQ() to call \_\_handle\_domain\_irq(), which now
rejects attempts to deliver IRQ0. Since IRQ 0 is used as the timer
interrupt (just like the PIT on x86), this causes boot to fail as the

Fix this by shuffling all interrupts up by one.

use GFP\_NOIO to make sure allocation doesn't blow back on us. Not all
callers need this, but I'm still hardcoding the flag inside rather than
making it a parameter because a) this is going to stable, and b) those
callers shouldn't really use rbd\_obj\_request\_create() and will be fixed

fixing infinite OPEN loop in 4.0 stateid recovery
commit e8d975e73e5fa05f983fbf2723120edcf68e0b38 upstream.
Problem: When an operation like WRITE receives a BAD\_STATEID, even though
recovery code clears the RECLAIM\_NOGRACE recovery flag before recovering
the open state, because of clearing delegation state for the associated
inode, nfs\_inode\_find\_state\_and\_recover() gets called and it makes the
same state with RECLAIM\_NOGRACE flag again. As a results, when we restart
looking over the open states, we end up in the infinite loop instead of
breaking out in the next test of state flags.
Solution: unset the RECLAIM\_NOGRACE set because of
calling of nfs\_inode\_find\_state\_and\_recover() after returning from calling
recover\_open() function.

clk: qcom: Use parent rate when set rate to pixel RCG clock
commit 6d451367bfa16fc103604bacd258f534c65d1540 upstream.
Since the parent rate has been recalculated, pixel RCG clock
should rely on it to find the correct M/N values during set\_rate,
instead of calling \_\_clk\_round\_rate() to its parent again.

watchdog: omap: assert the counter being stopped before reprogramming
commit 530c11d432727c697629ad5f9d00ee8e2864d453 upstream.
The omap watchdog has the annoying behaviour that writes to most
registers don't have any effect when the watchdog is already running.
Quoting the AM335x reference manual:
To modify the timer counter value (the WDT\_WCRR register),
prescaler ratio (the WDT\_WCLR[4:2] PTV bit field), delay
configuration value (the WDT\_WDLY[31:0] DLY\_VALUE bit field), or
the load value (the WDT\_WLDR[31:0] TIMER\_LOAD bit field), the
watchdog timer must be disabled by using the start/stop sequence
(the WDT\_WSPR register).
Currently the timer is stopped in the .probe callback but still there
are possibilities that yield to a situation where omap\_wdt\_start is
entered with the timer running (e.g. when /dev/watchdog is closed
without stopping and then reopened). In such a case programming the
timeout silently fails!
To circumvent this stop the timer before reprogramming.
Assuming one of the first things the watchdog user does is setting the
timeout explicitly nothing too bad should happen because this explicit
setting works fine.

This fixes a several year old regression that I found while trying
to get the Yoga 3 11 to work. The ideapad\_rfk\_set function is meant
to send a command to the embedded controller through ACPI, but
as of c1f73658ed, it sends the index of the rfkill device instead
of the command, and ignores the opcode field.
This changes it back to the original behavior, which indeed
flips the rfkill state as seen in the debugfs interface.

Interrupts cannot be requested/freed in the CPU\_STARTING/CPU\_DYING
notifications which run on the hotplugged cpu with interrupts and
preemption disabled.
To avoid the issue, request the interrupts for all possible cpus in
the boot code. The interrupts are marked NO\_AUTOENABLE to avoid a racy
request\_irq/disable\_irq() sequence. The flag prevents the
request\_irq() code from enabling the interrupt immediately.
The interrupt is then enabled in the CPU\_STARTING notifier of the
hotplugged cpu and again disabled with disable\_irq\_nosync() in the
CPU\_DYING notifier.

e1000e: Cleanup handling of VLAN\_HLEN as a part of max frame size
commit 8084b86dcfbc4b4822868c1dbdb429b5c08154e2 upstream.
When the VLAN\_HLEN was added to the calculation for the maximum frame size
there seems to have been a number of issues added to the driver.
The first issue is that in some cases the maximum frame size for a device
never really reached the actual maximum frame size as the VLAN header
length was not included the calculation for that value. As a result some
parts only supported a maximum frame size of either 1496 in the case of
parts that didn't support jumbo frames, and 8996 in the case of the parts
that do.
The second issue is the fact that there were several checks that weren't
updated so as a result setting an MTU of 1500 was treated as enabling jumbo
frames as the calculated value was 1522 instead of 1518. I have addressed
those by replacing ETH\_FRAME\_LEN with VLAN\_ETH\_FRAME\_LEN where appropriate.
The final issue was the fact that lowering the MTU below 1500 would cause
the driver to allocate 2K buffers for the rings. This is an old issue that
was fixed several years ago in igb/ixgbe and I am addressing now by just
replacing == with a <= so that we always just round up to 1522 for anything
that isn't a jumbo frame.

mac80211: prevent possible crypto tx tailroom corruption
commit ab499db80fcf07c18e4053f91a619500f663e90e upstream.
There was a possible race between
ieee80211\_reconfig() and
ieee80211\_delayed\_tailroom\_dec(). This could
result in inability to transmit data if driver
crashed during roaming or rekeying and subsequent
skbs with insufficient tailroom appeared.
This race was probably never seen in the wild
because a device driver would have to crash AND
recover within 0.5s which is very unlikely.
I was able to prove this race exists after
changing the delay to 10s locally and crashing
ath10k via debugfs immediately after GTK
rekeying. In case of ath10k the counter went below
0. This was harmless but other drivers which
actually require tailroom (e.g. for WEP ICV or
MMIC) could end up with the counter at 0 instead
of >0 and introduce insufficient skb tailroom
failures because mac80211 would not resize skbs
appropriately anymore.

cfg80211: ignore netif running state when changing iftype
commit 6cbfb1bb66e4e85da5db78e8ff429a85bd84ce64 upstream.
It was possible for mac80211 to be coerced into an
unexpected flow causing sdata union to become
corrupted. Station pointer was put into
sdata->u.vlan.sta memory location while it was
really master AP's sdata->u.ap.next\_beacon. This
led to station entry being later freed as
next\_beacon before \_\_sta\_info\_flush() in
ieee80211\_stop\_ap() and a subsequent invalid
pointer dereference crash.
The problem was that ieee80211\_ptr->use\_4addr
wasn't cleared on interface type changes.
This could be reproduced with the following steps:
# host A and host B have just booted; no
# wpa\_s/hostapd running; all vifs are down
host A> iw wlan0 set type station
host A> iw wlan0 set 4addr on
host A> printf 'interface=wlan0\nssid=4addrcrash\nchannel=1\nwds\_sta=1' > /tmp/hconf
host A> hostapd -B /tmp/conf
host B> iw wlan0 set 4addr on
host B> ifconfig wlan0 up
host B> iw wlan0 connect -w hostAssid

iwlwifi: mvm: fix ROC reference accounting

commit b112889c5af8124 ("iwlwifi: mvm: add Aux ROC request/response flow")
added aux ROC flow in addition to the existing ROC flow. While doing
it, it moved the ROC reference release to a common work item, which
is being called for both the ROC and aux ROC flows.
This resulted in invalid reference accounting, as no reference was
taken in case of aux ROC, while a reference was released on completion.
Fix it by adding a reference for the aux ROC as well, and release
only the relevant references on completion (according to the set bits).
While at it, convert cancel\_work\_sync() to flush\_work(), in order
to make sure the references are being cleaned properly.

The final version of commit 637241a900cb ("kmsg: honor dmesg\_restrict

processed incorrectly:
- open of /dev/kmsg checks syslog access permissions by using
check\_syslog\_permissions() where security\_syslog() is not called if
dmesg\_restrict is set.
- syslog syscall and /proc/kmsg calls do\_syslog() where security\_syslog
can be executed twice (inside check\_syslog\_permissions() and then
directly in do\_syslog())
With this patch security\_syslog() is called once only in all
syslog-related operations regardless of dmesg\_restrict value.

compiler-intel: fix wrong compiler barrier() macro
commit b86a50c3b5414eafdbee7f34af4a201a4a7817c2 upstream.
Cleanup commit 73679e508201 ("compiler-intel.h: Remove duplicate
definition") removed the double definition of \_\_memory\_barrier()
intrinsics.
However, in doing so, it also removed the preceding #undef barrier by
accident, meaning, the actual barrier() macro from compiler-gcc.h with
inline asm is still in place as \_\_GNUC\_\_ is provided.
Subsequently, barrier() can never be defined as \_\_memory\_barrier() from
compiler.h since it already has a definition in place and if we trust
the comment in compiler-intel.h, ecc doesn't support gcc specific asm
statements.
I don't have an ecc at hand (unsure if that's still used in the field?)
and only found this by accident during code review, a revert of that
cleanup would be simplest option.

firmware: dmi\_scan: Only honor end-of-table for 64-bit tables
commit 17cd5bd5391e6e7b363d66335e1bc6760ae969b9 upstream.
A 32-bit entry point to a DMI table says how many structures the table
contains. The SMBIOS specification explicitly says that end-of-table
markers should be ignored if they are not actually at the end of the
DMI table. So only honor the end-of-table marker for tables accessed
through 64-bit entry points, as they do not specify a structure count.

PM / sleep: Increase default DPM watchdog timeout to 60
commit fff3b16d2754a061a3549c4307a186423a0128fd upstream.
Many harddisks (mostly WD ones) have firmware problems and take too
long, more than 10 seconds, to resume from suspend. And this often
exceeds the default DPM watchdog timeout (12 seconds), resulting in a
kernel panic out of sudden.
Since most distros just take the default as is, we should give a bit
more safer value. This patch increases the default value from 12
seconds to one minute, which has been confirmed to be long enough for
such problematic disks.

mm/hugetlb: introduce minimum hugepage order
commit 641844f5616d7c6597309f560838f996466d7aac upstream.
Currently the initial value of order in dissolve\_free\_huge\_page is 64 or
32, which leads to the following warning in static checker:
mm/hugetlb.c:1203 dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages()
warn: potential right shift more than type allows '9,18,64'
This is a potential risk of infinite loop, because 1 << order (== 0) is used
in for-loop like this:
for (pfn =3D start\_pfn; pfn < end\_pfn; pfn +=3D 1 << order)
...
So this patch fixes it by using global minimum\_order calculated at boot time.

tty: remove platform\_sysrq\_reset\_seq
commit ffb6e0c9a0572f8e5f8e9337a1b40ac2ec1493a1 upstream.
The platform\_sysrq\_reset\_seq code was intended as a way for an embedded
platform to provide its own sysrq sequence at compile time. After over two
years, nobody has started using it in an upstream kernel, and the platforms
that were interested in it have moved on to devicetree, which can be used
to configure the sequence without requiring kernel changes. The method is
also incompatible with the way that most architectures build support for
multiple platforms into a single kernel.
Now the code is producing warnings when built with gcc-5.1:
drivers/tty/sysrq.c: In function 'sysrq\_init':
drivers/tty/sysrq.c:959:33: warning: array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
key = platform\_sysrq\_reset\_seq[i];
We could fix this, but it seems unlikely that it will ever be used, so
let's just remove the code instead. We still have the option to pass the
sequence either in DT, using the kernel command line, or using the
/sys/module/sysrq/parameters/reset\_seq file.

RDMA/ocrdma: fix double free on pd

A reorganisation of the PD allocation and deallocation in commit

The original call to ocrdma\_mbx\_dealloc\_pd() (which does not kfree
pd) was replaced with a call to \_ocrdma\_dealloc\_pd() (which does
kfree pd). The kfree following this call causes the double free,
so just remove it to fix the problem.

tries to dereference an error pointer.

2. Host OCR mask if set by the driver (based on DT properties)

mmc: card: Fixup request missing in mmc\_blk\_issue\_rw\_rq
commit 29535f7b797df35cc9b6b3bca635591cdd3dd2a8 upstream.
The current handler of MMC\_BLK\_CMD\_ERR in mmc\_blk\_issue\_rw\_rq function
may cause new coming request permanent missing when the ongoing
request (previoulsy started) complete end.
The problem scenario is as follows:
(1) Request A is ongoing;
(2) Request B arrived, and finally mmc\_blk\_issue\_rw\_rq() is called;
(3) Request A encounters the MMC\_BLK\_CMD\_ERR error;
(4) In the error handling of MMC\_BLK\_CMD\_ERR, suppose mmc\_blk\_cmd\_err()
end request A completed and return zero. Continue the error handling,
suppose mmc\_blk\_reset() reset device success;
(5) Continue the execution, while loop completed because variable ret
is zero now;
(6) Finally, mmc\_blk\_issue\_rw\_rq() return without processing request B.
The process related to the missing request may wait that IO request
complete forever, possibly crashing the application or hanging the system.
Fix this issue by starting new request when reset success.

That error can be triggered by the newly added samsung earlycon support,

'select SERIAL\_EARLYCON' statement to the samsung console driver

ACPI / PCI: Fix regressions caused by resource\_size\_t overflow with 32-bit kernel
commit 1fb01ca93a1348a1469b8777326cd7632483de77 upstream.
Zoltan Boszormenyi reported this regression:
"There's a Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 (PCI ID 10ec:8168, Subsystem ID
1565:230e) network chip on the mainboard. After the r8169 driver loaded
the IRQs in the machine went berserk. Keyboard keypressed arrived with
considerable latency and duplicated, so no real work was possible.
The machine responded to the power button but didn't actually power
down. It just stuck at the powering down message. I had to press the
power button for 4 seconds to power it down.
The computer is a POS machine with a big battery inside. Because of this,
either ACPI or the Realtek chip kept the bad state and after rebooting,
the network chip didn't even show up in lspci. Not even the PXE ROM
announced itself during boot. I had to disconnect the battery to beat
some sense back to the computer.
The regression happens with 4.0.5, 4.1.0-rc8 and 4.1.0-final. 3.18.16 was
good."
The regression is caused by commit 593669c2ac0f (x86/PCI/ACPI: Use common
ACPI resource interfaces to simplify implementation). Since commit
593669c2ac0f, x86 PCI ACPI host bridge driver validates ACPI resources by
first converting an ACPI resource to a 'struct resource' structure and
then applying checks against the converted resource structure. The 'start'
and 'end' fields in 'struct resource' are defined to be type of
resource\_size\_t, which may be 32 bits or 64 bits depending on
CONFIG\_PHYS\_ADDR\_T\_64BIT.
This may cause incorrect resource validation results with 32-bit kernels
because 64-bit ACPI resource descriptors may get truncated when converting
to 32-bit 'start' and 'end' fields in 'struct resource'. It eventually
affects PCI resource allocation subsystem and makes some PCI devices and
the system behave abnormally due to incorrect resource assignment.
So enhance the ACPI resource parsing interfaces to ignore ACPI resource
descriptors with address/offset above 4G when running in 32-bit mode.
With the fix applied, the behavior of the machine was restored to how
3.18.16 worked, i.e. the memory range that is over 4GB is ignored again,
and lspci -vvxxx shows that everything is at the same memory window as
they were with 3.18.16.

ACPICA: Tables: Enable both 32-bit and 64-bit FACS

The following commit is reported to have broken s2ram on some platforms:
Commit: 0249ed2444d65d65fc3f3f64f398f1ad0b7e54cd
ACPICA: Add option to favor 32-bit FADT addresses.
The platform reports 2 FACS tables (which is not allowed by ACPI
specification) and the new 32-bit address favor rule forces OSPMs to use
the FACS table reported via FADT's X\_FIRMWARE\_CTRL field.
The root cause of the reported bug might be one of the followings:
1. BIOS may favor the 64-bit firmware waking vector address when the
version of the FACS is greater than 0 and Linux currently only supports
resuming from the real mode, so the 64-bit firmware waking vector has
never been set and might be invalid to BIOS while the commit enables
higher version FACS.
2. BIOS may favor the FACS reported via the "FIRMWARE\_CTRL" field in the
FADT while the commit doesn't set the firmware waking vector address of
the FACS reported by "FIRMWARE\_CTRL", it only sets the firware waking
vector address of the FACS reported by "X\_FIRMWARE\_CTRL".
This patch excludes the cases that can trigger the bugs caused by the root
cause 2.
There is no handshaking mechanism can be used by OSPM to tell BIOS which
FACS is currently used. Thus the FACS reported by "FIRMWARE\_CTRL" may still
be used by BIOS and the 0 value of the 32-bit firmware waking vector might
trigger such failure.
This patch tries to favor 32bit FACS address in another way where both the
FACS reported by "FIRMWARE\_CTRL" and the FACS reported by "X\_FIRMWARE\_CTRL"
are loaded so that further commit can set firmware waking vector in the
both tables to ensure we can exclude the cases that trigger the bugs caused
by the root cause 2. The exclusion is split into 2 commits as this commit
is also useful for dumping more ACPI tables, it won't get reverted when
such exclusion is no longer necessary. Lv Zheng.

ACPI / PNP: Reserve ACPI resources at the fs\_initcall\_sync stage
commit 0294112ee3135fbd15eaa70015af8283642dd970 upstream.
This effectively reverts the following three commits:
7bc10388ccdd ACPI / resources: free memory on error in add\_region\_before()
0f1b414d1907 ACPI / PNP: Avoid conflicting resource reservations
b9a5e5e18fbf ACPI / init: Fix the ordering of acpi\_reserve\_resources()
(commit b9a5e5e18fbf introduced regressions some of which, but not
all, were addressed by commit 0f1b414d1907 and commit 7bc10388ccdd
was a fixup on top of the latter) and causes ACPI fixed hardware
resources to be reserved at the fs\_initcall\_sync stage of system
initialization.
The story is as follows. First, a boot regression was reported due
to an apparent resource reservation ordering change after a commit
that shouldn't lead to such changes. Investigation led to the
conclusion that the problem happened because acpi\_reserve\_resources()
was executed at the device\_initcall() stage of system initialization
which wasn't strictly ordered with respect to driver initialization
(and with respect to the initialization of the pcieport driver in
particular), so a random change causing the device initcalls to be
run in a different order might break things.
The response to that was to attempt to run acpi\_reserve\_resources()
as soon as we knew that ACPI would be in use (commit b9a5e5e18fbf).
However, that turned out to be too early, because it caused resource
reservations made by the PNP system driver to fail on at least one
system and that failure was addressed by commit 0f1b414d1907.
That fix still turned out to be insufficient, though, because
calling acpi\_reserve\_resources() before the fs\_initcall stage of
system initialization caused a boot regression to happen on the
eCAFE EC-800-H20G/S netbook. That meant that we only could call
acpi\_reserve\_resources() at the fs\_initcall initialization stage
or later, but then we might just as well call it after the PNP
initalization in which case commit 0f1b414d1907 wouldn't be
necessary any more.
For this reason, the changes made by commit 0f1b414d1907 are reverted
(along with a memory leak fixup on top of that commit), the changes
made by commit b9a5e5e18fbf that went too far are reverted too and
acpi\_reserve\_resources() is changed into fs\_initcall\_sync, which
will cause it to be executed after the PNP subsystem initialization
(which is an fs\_initcall) and before device initcalls (including
the pcieport driver initialization) which should avoid the initial
issue.

shared anonymous mappings. However, even before that regression, the
checking on such mprotect PROT\_EXEC calls was inconsistent with the
checking on a mmap PROT\_EXEC call for a shared anonymous mapping. On a
mmap, the security hook is passed a NULL file and knows it is dealing
with an anonymous mapping and therefore applies an execmem check and no
file checks. On a mprotect, the security hook is passed a vma with a
non-NULL vm\_file (as this was set from the internally-created shmem
file during mmap) and therefore applies the file-based execute check
and no execmem check. Since the aforementioned commit now marks the
shmem zero inode with the S\_PRIVATE flag, the file checks are disabled
and we have no checking at all on mprotect PROT\_EXEC. Add a test to
the mprotect hook logic for such private inodes, and apply an execmem
check in that case. This makes the mmap and mprotect checking
consistent for shared anonymous mappings, as well as for /dev/zero and
ashmem.

selinux: don't waste ebitmap space when importing NetLabel categories
commit 3324603524925c7727207027d1c15e597412d15e upstream.
At present we don't create efficient ebitmaps when importing NetLabel
category bitmaps. This can present a problem when comparing ebitmaps
since ebitmap\_cmp() is very strict about these things and considers
these wasteful ebitmaps not equal when compared to their more
efficient counterparts, even if their values are the same. This isn't
likely to cause problems on 64-bit systems due to a bit of luck on
how NetLabel/CIPSO works and the default ebitmap size, but it can be
a problem on 32-bit systems.
This patch fixes this problem by being a bit more intelligent when
importing NetLabel category bitmaps by skipping over empty sections
which should result in a nice, efficient ebitmap.

Btrfs: fix file corruption after cloning inline extents
commit ed958762644b404654a6f5d23e869f496fe127c6 upstream.
Using the clone ioctl (or extent\_same ioctl, which calls the same extent
cloning function as well) we end up allowing copy an inline extent from
the source file into a non-zero offset of the destination file. This is
something not expected and that the btrfs code is not prepared to deal
with - all inline extents must be at a file offset equals to 0.
For example, the following excerpt of a test case for fstests triggers
a crash/BUG\_ON() on a write operation after an inline extent is cloned
into a non-zero offset:
\_scratch\_mkfs >>$seqres.full 2>&1
\_scratch\_mount
# Create our test files. File foo has the same 2K of data at offset 4K
# as file bar has at its offset 0.
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -s -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 0 4K" \
-c "pwrite -S 0xbb 4k 2K" \
-c "pwrite -S 0xcc 8K 4K" \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# File bar consists of a single inline extent (2K size).
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -s -c "pwrite -S 0xbb 0 2K" \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/bar | \_filter\_xfs\_io
# Now call the clone ioctl to clone the extent of file bar into file
# foo at its offset 4K. This made file foo have an inline extent at
# offset 4K, something which the btrfs code can not deal with in future
# IO operations because all inline extents are supposed to start at an
# offset of 0, resulting in all sorts of chaos.
# So here we validate that clone ioctl returns an EOPNOTSUPP, which is
# what it returns for other cases dealing with inlined extents.
$CLONER\_PROG -s 0 -d $((4 \* 1024)) -l $((2 \* 1024)) \
$SCRATCH\_MNT/bar $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo
# Because of the inline extent at offset 4K, the following write made
# the kernel crash with a BUG\_ON().
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xdd 6K 2K" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foo | \_filter\_xfs\_io
status=0
exit
The stack trace of the BUG\_ON() triggered by the last write is:

inline extent into a non-zero offset happens, just like what is done for
other scenarios that would require copying/splitting inline extents,
which were introduced by the following commits:

Btrfs: fix list transaction->pending\_ordered corruption
commit d3efe08400317888f559bbedf0e42cd31575d0ef upstream.
When we call btrfs\_commit\_transaction(), we splice the list "ordered"
of our transaction handle into the transaction's "pending\_ordered"
list, but we don't re-initialize the "ordered" list of our transaction
handle, this means it still points to the same elements it used to
before the splice. Then we check if the current transaction's state is
>= TRANS\_STATE\_COMMIT\_START and if it is we end up calling
btrfs\_end\_transaction() which simply splices again the "ordered" list
of our handle into the transaction's "pending\_ordered" list, leaving
multiple pointers to the same ordered extents which results in list
corruption when we are iterating, removing and freeing ordered extents
at btrfs\_wait\_pending\_ordered(), resulting in access to dangling
pointers / use-after-free issues.
Similarly, btrfs\_end\_transaction() can end up in some cases calling
btrfs\_commit\_transaction(), and both did a list splice of the transaction
handle's "ordered" list into the transaction's "pending\_ordered" without
re-initializing the handle's "ordered" list, resulting in exactly the
same problem.
This produces the following warning on a kernel with linked list

Btrfs: fix memory leak in the extent\_same ioctl

We were allocating memory with memdup\_user() but we were never releasing
that memory. This affected pretty much every call to the ioctl, whether
it deduplicated extents or not.
This issue was reported on IRC by Julian Taylor and on the mailing list

Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after append write
commit e4545de5b035c7debb73d260c78377dbb69cbfb5 upstream.
If we do an append write to a file (which increases its inode's i\_size)
that does not have the flag BTRFS\_INODE\_NEEDS\_FULL\_SYNC set in its inode,
and the previous transaction added a new hard link to the file, which sets
the flag BTRFS\_INODE\_COPY\_EVERYTHING in the file's inode, and then fsync
the file, the inode's new i\_size isn't logged. This has the consequence
that after the fsync log is replayed, the file size remains what it was
before the append write operation, which means users/applications will
not be able to read the data that was successsfully fsync'ed before.
This happens because neither the inode item nor the delayed inode get
their i\_size updated when the append write is made - doing so would
require starting a transaction in the buffered write path, something that
we do not do intentionally for performance reasons.
Fix this by making sure that when the flag BTRFS\_INODE\_COPY\_EVERYTHING is
set the inode is logged with its current i\_size (log the in-memory inode
into the log tree).
This issue is not a recent regression and is easy to reproduce with the
following test case for fstests:

# Now append more data to our file, increasing its size, and fsync the file.
# In btrfs because the inode flag BTRFS\_INODE\_COPY\_EVERYTHING was set and the
# write path did not update the inode item in the btree nor the delayed inode
# item (in memory struture) in the current transaction (created by the fsync
# handler), the fsync did not record the inode's new i\_size in the fsync

Btrfs: fix race between caching kthread and returning inode to inode cache
commit ae9d8f17118551bedd797406a6768b87c2146234 upstream.
While the inode cache caching kthread is calling btrfs\_unpin\_free\_ino(),
we could have a concurrent call to btrfs\_return\_ino() that adds a new
entry to the root's free space cache of pinned inodes. This concurrent
call does not acquire the fs\_info->commit\_root\_sem before adding a new
entry if the caching state is BTRFS\_CACHE\_FINISHED, which is a problem
because the caching kthread calls btrfs\_unpin\_free\_ino() after setting
the caching state to BTRFS\_CACHE\_FINISHED and therefore races with
the task calling btrfs\_return\_ino(), which is adding a new entry, while
the former (caching kthread) is navigating the cache's rbtree, removing
and freeing nodes from the cache's rbtree without acquiring the spinlock
that protects the rbtree.
This race resulted in memory corruption due to double free of struct
btrfs\_free\_space objects because both tasks can end up doing freeing the
same objects. Note that adding a new entry can result in merging it with
other entries in the cache, in which case those entries are freed.
This is particularly important as btrfs\_free\_space structures are also
used for the block group free space caches.
This memory corruption can be detected by a debugging kernel, which
reports it with the following trace:

Btrfs: use kmem\_cache\_free when freeing entry in inode cache
commit c3f4a1685bb87e59c886ee68f7967eae07d4dffa upstream.
The free space entries are allocated using kmem\_cache\_zalloc(),
through \_\_btrfs\_add\_free\_space(), therefore we should use
kmem\_cache\_free() and not kfree() to avoid any confusion and
any potential problem. Looking at the kfree() definition at
mm/slab.c it has the following comment:
/\*
\* (...)
\*
\* Don't free memory not originally allocated by kmalloc()
\* or you will run into trouble.
\*/
So better be safe and use kmem\_cache\_free().

Btrfs: don't invalidate root dentry when subvolume deletion fails
commit 64ad6c488975d7516230cf7849190a991fd615ae upstream.
Since commit bafc9b754f75 ("vfs: More precise tests in d\_invalidate"),
mounted subvolumes can be deleted because d\_invalidate() won't fail.
However, we run into problems when we attempt to delete the default
subvolume while it is mounted as the root filesystem:
# btrfs subvol list /
ID 257 gen 306 top level 5 path rootvol
ID 267 gen 334 top level 5 path snap1
# btrfs subvol get-default /
ID 267 gen 334 top level 5 path snap1
# btrfs inspect-internal rootid /
267
# mount -o subvol=/ /dev/vda1 /mnt
# btrfs subvol del /mnt/snap1
Delete subvolume (no-commit): '/mnt/snap1'
ERROR: cannot delete '/mnt/snap1' - Operation not permitted
# findmnt /
findmnt: can't read /proc/mounts: No such file or directory
# ls /proc
#
Markus reported that this same scenario simply led to a kernel oops.
This happens because in btrfs\_ioctl\_snap\_destroy(), we call
d\_invalidate() before we check may\_destroy\_subvol(), which means that we
detach the submounts and drop the dentry before erroring out. Instead,
we should only invalidate the dentry once the deletion has succeeded.
Additionally, the shrink\_dcache\_sb() isn't necessary; d\_invalidate()
will prune the dcache for the deleted subvolume.

hwmon: (mcp3021) Fix broken output scaling
commit 347d7e45bd09ce09cbc30d5cea9de377eb22f55c upstream.
The mcp3021 scaling code is dividing the VDD (full-scale) value in
millivolts by the A2D resolution to obtain the scaling factor. When VDD
is 3300mV (the standard value) and the resolution is 12-bit (4096
divisions), the result is a scale factor of 3300/4096, which is always
one. Effectively, the raw A2D reading is always being returned because
no scaling is applied.
This patch fixes the issue and simplifies the register-to-volts
calculation, removing the unneeded "output\_scale" struct member.

md: Skip cluster setup for dm-raid
commit d3b178adb3a3adf54ecf77758138b654c3ee7f09 upstream.
There is a bug that the bitmap superblock isn't initialised properly for
dm-raid, so a new field can have garbage in new fields.
(dm-raid does initialisation in the kernel - md initialised the
superblock in mdadm).
This means that for dm-raid we cannot currently trust the new ->nodes
field. So:
- use \_\_GFP\_ZERO to initialise the superblock properly for all new
arrays
- initialise all fields in bitmap\_info in bitmap\_new\_disk\_sb
- ignore ->nodes for dm arrays (yes, this is a hack)
This bug exposes dm-raid to bug in the (still experimental) md-cluster
code, so it is suitable for -stable. It does cause crashes.

md: clear mddev->private when it has been freed.
commit bd6919228d7e1867ae9e24ab27e3e4a366c87d21 upstream.
If ->private is set when ->run is called, it is assumed to be
a 'config' prepared as part of 'reshape'.
So it is important when we free that config, that we also clear ->private.
This is not often a problem as the mddev will normally be discarded
shortly after the config us freed.
However if an 'assemble' races with a final close, the assemble can use
the old mddev which has a stale ->private. This leads to any of
various sorts of crashes.
So clear ->private after calling ->free().

"The output result of trace\_foo\_bar event in traceevent samples is
wrong. This problem can be reproduced as following:
(Build kernel with SAMPLE\_TRACE\_EVENTS=m)
$ insmod trace-events-sample.ko

This was caused by an update to have \_\_print\_array()'s second parameter
be the count of items in the array and not the size of the array.
As there is already users of \_\_print\_array(), it can not change. But
the sample code can and we can also improve on the documentation about
\_\_print\_array() and \_\_get\_dynamic\_array\_len().

tracing: Have branch tracer use recursive field of task struct
commit 6224beb12e190ff11f3c7d4bf50cb2922878f600 upstream.
Fengguang Wu's tests triggered a bug in the branch tracer's start up
test when CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PREEMPT set. This was because that config
adds some debug logic in the per cpu field, which calls back into
the branch tracer.
The branch tracer has its own recursive checks, but uses a per cpu
variable to implement it. If retrieving the per cpu variable calls
back into the branch tracer, you can see how things will break.
Instead of using a per cpu variable, use the trace\_recursion field
of the current task struct. Simply set a bit when entering the
branch tracing and clear it when leaving. If the bit is set on
entry, just don't do the tracing.
There's also the case with lockdep, as the local\_irq\_save() called
before the recursion can also trigger code that can call back into
the function. Changing that to a raw\_local\_irq\_save() will protect
that as well.
This prevents the recursion and the inevitable crash that follows.

tracing/filter: Do not allow infix to exceed end of string
commit 6b88f44e161b9ee2a803e5b2b1fbcf4e20e8b980 upstream.
While debugging a WARN\_ON() for filtering, I found that it is possible
for the filter string to be referenced after its end. With the filter:
# echo '>' > /sys/kernel/debug/events/ext4/ext4\_truncate\_exit/filter
The filter\_parse() function can call infix\_get\_op() which calls
infix\_advance() that updates the infix filter pointers for the cnt
and tail without checking if the filter is already at the end, which
will put the cnt to zero and the tail beyond the end. The loop then calls
infix\_next() that has
ps->infix.cnt--;
return ps->infix.string[ps->infix.tail++];
The cnt will now be below zero, and the tail that is returned is
already passed the end of the filter string. So far the allocation
of the filter string usually has some buffer that is zeroed out, but
if the filter string is of the exact size of the allocated buffer
there's no guarantee that the charater after the nul terminating
character will be zero.
Luckily, only root can write to the filter.

tracing/filter: Do not WARN on operand count going below zero
commit b4875bbe7e68f139bd3383828ae8e994a0df6d28 upstream.
When testing the fix for the trace filter, I could not come up with
a scenario where the operand count goes below zero, so I added a
WARN\_ON\_ONCE(cnt < 0) to the logic. But there is legitimate case
that it can happen (although the filter would be wrong).
# echo '>' > /sys/kernel/debug/events/ext4/ext4\_truncate\_exit/filter
That is, a single operation without any operands will hit the path
where the WARN\_ON\_ONCE() can trigger. Although this is harmless,
and the filter is reported as a error. But instead of spitting out
a warning to the kernel dmesg, just fail nicely and report it via
the proper channels.

ima: update builtin policies
commit 24fd03c87695a76f0517df42a37e51b1597d2c8a upstream.
This patch defines a builtin measurement policy "tcb", similar to the
existing "ima\_tcb", but with additional rules to also measure files
based on the effective uid and to measure files opened with the "read"
mode bit set (eg. read, read-write).
Changing the builtin "ima\_tcb" policy could potentially break existing
users. Instead of defining a new separate boot command line option each
time the builtin measurement policy is modified, this patch defines a
single generic boot command line option "ima\_policy=" to specify the
builtin policy and deprecates the use of the builtin ima\_tcb policy.
[The "ima\_policy=" boot command line option is based on Roberto Sassu's
"ima: added new policy type exec" patch.]

KEYS: ensure we free the assoc array edit if edit is valid
commit ca4da5dd1f99fe9c59f1709fb43e818b18ad20e0 upstream.
\_\_key\_link\_end is not freeing the associated array edit structure
and this leads to a 512 byte memory leak each time an identical
existing key is added with add\_key().
The reason the add\_key() system call returns okay is that
key\_create\_or\_update() calls \_\_key\_link\_begin() before checking to see
whether it can update a key directly rather than adding/replacing - which
it turns out it can. Thus \_\_key\_link() is not called through
\_\_key\_instantiate\_and\_link() and \_\_key\_link\_end() must cancel the edit.

ACPI table and namely the physical address of the control area is set to
zero.
This patch changes the driver to fail gracefully when we observe a zero
address instead of continuing to ioremap.

tpm: Fix initialization of the cdev
commit ba0ef85479c46a2ab354c2220bdb6152f7f4baf3 upstream.
When a cdev is contained in a dynamic structure the cdev parent kobj
should be set to the kobj that controls the lifetime of the enclosing
structure. In TPM's case this is the embedded struct device.
Also, cdev\_init 0's the whole structure, so all sets must be after,
not before. This fixes module ref counting and cdev.

A temperature conversion can take 750 ms and when possible the

If that happens the sl->family\_data will be freed and set to NULL

xfs: don't truncate attribute extents if no extents exist
commit f66bf042693b620133d39af8d2f13615f03eadfc upstream.
The xfs\_attr3\_root\_inactive() call from xfs\_attr\_inactive() assumes that
attribute blocks exist to invalidate. It is possible to have an
attribute fork without extents, however. Consider the case where the
attribute fork is created towards the beginning of xfs\_attr\_set() but
some part of the subsequent attribute set fails.
If an inode in such a state hits xfs\_attr\_inactive(), it eventually
calls xfs\_dabuf\_map() and possibly xfs\_bmapi\_read(). The former emits a
filesystem corruption warning, returns an error that bubbles back up to
xfs\_attr\_inactive(), and leads to destruction of the in-core attribute
fork without an on-disk reset. If the inode happens to make it back
through xfs\_inactive() in this state (e.g., via a concurrent bulkstat
that cycles the inode from the reclaim state and releases it), i\_afp
might not exist when xfs\_bmapi\_read() is called and causes a NULL
dereference panic.
A '-p 2' fsstress run to ENOSPC on a relatively small fs (1GB)
reproduces these problems. The behavior is a regression caused by:
6dfe5a0 xfs: xfs\_attr\_inactive leaves inconsistent attr fork state behind
... which removed logic that avoided the attribute extent truncate when
no extents exist. Restore this logic to ensure the attribute fork is
destroyed and reset correctly if it exists without any allocated
extents.

xfs: fix remote symlinks on V5/CRC filesystems
commit 2ac56d3d4bd625450a54d4c3f9292d58f6b88232 upstream.
If we create a CRC filesystem, mount it, and create a symlink with
a path long enough that it can't live in the inode, we get a very
strange result upon remount:
# ls -l mnt
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 929 Jun 15 16:58 link -> XSLM
XSLM is the V5 symlink block header magic (which happens to be
followed by a NUL, so the string looks terminated).
xfs\_readlink\_bmap() advanced cur\_chunk by the size of the header
for CRC filesystems, but never actually used that pointer; it
kept reading from bp->b\_addr, which is the start of the block,
rather than the start of the symlink data after the header.
Looks like this problem goes back to v3.10.
Fixing this gets us reading the proper link target, again.

Once the core functions return successfully, the rockchip mmap routines
can still use dma\_mmap\_attrs() to simply mmap the entire buffer.
[0] Previously, we were performing the mmap() without first taking a
reference on the underlying gem buffer. This could leak ptes if the gem
object is destroyed while userspace is still holding the mapping.

drm/radeon: Handle irqs only based on irq ring, not irq status regs.
commit 07f18f0bb8d8d65badd8b4988b40d329fc0cc6dc upstream.
Trying to resolve issues with missed vblanks and impossible
values inside delivered kms pageflip completion events showed
that radeon's irq handling sometimes doesn't handle valid irqs,
but silently skips them. This was observed for vblank interrupts.
Although those irqs have corresponding events queued in the gpu's
irq ring at time of interrupt, and therefore the corresponding
handling code gets triggered by these events, the handling code
sometimes silently skipped processing the irq. The reason for those
skips is that the handling code double-checks for each irq event if
the corresponding irq status bits in the irq status registers
are set. Sometimes those bits are not set at time of check
for valid irqs, maybe due to some hardware race on some setups?
The problem only seems to happen on some machine + card combos
sometimes, e.g., never happened during my testing of different PC
cards of the DCE-2/3/4 generation a year ago, but happens consistently
now on two different Apple Mac cards (RV730, DCE-3, Apple iMac and
Evergreen JUNIPER, DCE-4 in a Apple MacPro). It also doesn't happen
at each interrupt but only occassionally every couple of
hundred or thousand vblank interrupts.
This results in XOrg warning messages like
"[ 7084.472] (WW) RADEON(0): radeon\_dri2\_flip\_event\_handler:
Pageflip completion event has impossible msc 420120 < target\_msc 420121"
as well as skipped frames and problems for applications that
use kms pageflip events or vblank events, e.g., users of DRI2 and
DRI3/Present, Waylands Weston compositor, etc. See also
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=85203
After some talking to Alex and Michel, we decided to fix this
by turning the double-check for asserted irq status bits into a
warning. Whenever a irq event is queued in the IH ring, always
execute the corresponding interrupt handler. Still check the irq
status bits, but only to log a DRM\_DEBUG message on a mismatch.
This fixed the problems reliably on both previously failing
cards, RV-730 dual-head tested on both crtcs (pipes D1 and D2)
and a triple-output Juniper HD-5770 card tested on all three
available crtcs (D1/D2/D3). The r600 and evergreen irq handling
is therefore tested, but the cik an si handling is only compile
tested due to lack of hw.

fully initialize by regular kernel then freeze callback happens

and turn off each of the block. It turns out we were not cleanly

drm/i915: Use two 32bit reads for select 64bit REG\_READ ioctls
commit 648a9bc5308d952f2c80772301b339f73026f013 upstream.
Since the hardware sometimes mysteriously totally flummoxes the 64bit
read of a 64bit register when read using a single instruction, split the
read into two instructions. Since the read here is of automatically
incrementing timestamp counters, we also have to be very careful in
order to make sure that it does not increment between the two
instructions.
However, since userspace tried to workaround this issue and so enshrined
this ABI for a broken hardware read and in the process neglected that
the read only fails in some environments, we have to introduce a new
uABI flag for userspace to request the 2x32 bit accurate read of the
timestamp.
v2: Fix alignment check and include details of the workaround for
userspace.

drm/i915: Forward all core DRM ioctls to core compat handling
commit ac7e7ab1c3243b10b41653cc8d8536088d83b152 upstream.
Previously only core DRM ioctls under the DRM\_COMMAND\_BASE were being
forwarded, but the drm.h header suggests (and reality confirms) ones
after (and including) DRM\_COMMAND\_END should be forwarded as well.
We need this to correctly forward the compat ioctl for the botched-up
addfb2.1 extension.

drm/i915: Snapshot seqno of most recently submitted request.
commit 94f7bbe1509731bdef651d7fb235b2c31fb23be8 upstream.
The hang checker needs to inspect whether or not the ring request list is empty
as well as if the given engine has reached or passed the most recently
submitted request. The problem with this is that the hang checker cannot grab
the struct\_mutex, which is required in order to safely inspect requests since
requests might be deallocated during inspection. In the past we've had kernel
panics due to this very unsynchronized access in the hang checker.
One solution to this problem is to not inspect the requests directly since
we're only interested in the seqno of the most recently submitted request - not
the request itself. Instead the seqno of the most recently submitted request is
stored separately, which the hang checker then inspects, circumventing the
issue of synchronization from the hang checker entirely.
This fixes a regression introduced in

drm/i915: Declare the swizzling unknown for L-shaped configurations
commit 19ee835cdb0b5a8eb11a68f25a51b8039d564488 upstream.
The old style of memory interleaving swizzled upto the end of the
first even bank of memory, and then used the remainder as unswizzled on
the unpaired bank - i.e. swizzling is not constant for all memory. This
causes problems when we try to migrate memory and so the kernel prevents
migration at all when we detect L-shaped inconsistent swizzling.
However, this issue also extends to userspace who try to manually detile
into memory as the swizzling for an individual page is unknown (it
depends on its physical address only known to the kernel), userspace
cannot correctly swizzle objects.
v2: Mark the global swizzling as unknown rather than adjust the value
reported to userspace.

drm/i915: Fix IPS related flicker
commit ac88cd738425e04dbed3706621cf613a00708834 upstream.
We cannot let IPS enabled with no plane on the pipe:
BSpec: "IPS cannot be enabled until after at least one plane has
been enabled for at least one vertical blank." and "IPS must be
disabled while there is still at least one plane enabled on the
same pipe as IPS." This restriction apply to HSW and BDW.
However a shortcut path on update primary plane function
to make primary plane invisible by setting DSPCTRL to 0
was leting IPS enabled while there was no
other plane enabled on the pipe causing flickerings that we were
believing that it was caused by that other restriction where
ips cannot be used when pixel rate is greater than 95% of cdclok.
v2: Don't mess with Atomic path as pointed out by Ville.

I've only seen this once, and I failed to capture the
lockdep backtrace, but I did some investigations.
If we are calling into the MST layer from EDID probing,
we have the mode\_config mutex held, if during that EDID
probing, the MST hub goes away, then we can get a deadlock
where the connector destruction function in the driver
tries to retake the mode config mutex.
This offloads connector destruction to a workqueue,
and avoid the subsequenct lock ordering issue.

Commit 20d0189b1012 "block: Introduce new bio\_split()" permits sharing
the bio\_vec between the two resulting bios. That is fine for read/write
requests where the bio\_vec is immutable. For discards, however, we need
to be able to attach a payload and update the bio\_vec so the page can
get mapped to a scatterlist entry. Therefore the bio\_vec can not be
shared when splitting discards and we must do a full clone.

If there are too many pending per work I/O, too many

This patch limits the max\_active parameter of workqueue as 16.
This patch fixes Fedora 22 live booting performance
regression when it is booted from squashfs over dm
based on loop, and looks the following reasons are
related with the problem:
- not like other filesyststems(such as ext4), squashfs
is a bit special, and I observed that increasing I/O jobs
to access file in squashfs only improve I/O performance a
little, but it can make big difference for ext4
- nested loop: both squashfs.img and ext3fs.img are mounted
as loop block, and ext3fs.img is inside the squashfs
- during booting, lots of tasks may run concurrently

dm thin: allocate the cell\_sort\_array dynamically
commit a822c83e47d97cdef38c4352e1ef62d9f46cfe98 upstream.
Given the pool's cell\_sort\_array holds 8192 pointers it triggers an
order 5 allocation via kmalloc. This order 5 allocation is prone to
failure as system memory gets more fragmented over time.
Fix this by allocating the cell\_sort\_array using vmalloc.

dm btree remove: fix bug in redistribute3
commit 4c7e309340ff85072e96f529582d159002c36734 upstream.
redistribute3() shares entries out across 3 nodes. Some entries were
being moved the wrong way, breaking the ordering. This manifested as a
BUG() in dm-btree-remove.c:shift() when entries were removed from the

dm space map metadata: fix occasional leak of a metadata block on resize
commit 6096d91af0b65a3967139b32d5adbb3647858a26 upstream.
The metadata space map has a simplified 'bootstrap' mode that is
operational when extending the space maps. Whilst in this mode it's
possible for some refcount decrement operations to become queued (eg, as
a result of shadowing one of the bitmap indexes). These decrements were
not being applied when switching out of bootstrap mode.
The effect of this bug was the leaking of a 4k metadata block. This is
detected by the latest version of thin\_check as a non fatal error.

dm cache: fix race when issuing a POLICY\_REPLACE operation
commit fb4100ae7f312c3d614b37621c2b17b3b7cf65f8 upstream.
There is a race between a policy deciding to replace a cache entry,
the core target writing back any dirty data from this block, and other
IO threads doing IO to the same block.
This sort of problem is avoided most of the time by the core target
grabbing a bio prison cell before making the request to the policy.
But for a demotion the core target doesn't know which block will be
demoted, so can't do this in advance.
Fix this demotion race by introducing a callback to the policy interface
that allows the policy to grab the cell on behalf of the core target.

usb: xhci: Bugfix for NULL pointer deference in xhci\_endpoint\_init() function
commit 3496810663922617d4b706ef2780c279252ddd6a upstream.
virt\_dev->num\_cached\_rings counts on freed ring and is not updated
correctly. In xhci\_free\_or\_cache\_endpoint\_ring() function, the free ring
is added into cache and then num\_rings\_cache is incremented as below:
virt\_dev->ring\_cache[rings\_cached] =
virt\_dev->eps[ep\_index].ring;
virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached++;
here, free ring pointer is added to a current index and then
index is incremented.
So current index always points to empty location in the ring cache.
For getting available free ring, current index should be decremented
first and then corresponding ring buffer value should be taken from ring
cache.
But In function xhci\_endpoint\_init(), the num\_rings\_cached index is
accessed before decrement.
virt\_dev->eps[ep\_index].new\_ring =
virt\_dev->ring\_cache[virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached];
virt\_dev->ring\_cache[virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached] = NULL;
virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached--;
This is bug in manipulating the index of ring cache.
And it should be as below:
virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached--;
virt\_dev->eps[ep\_index].new\_ring =
virt\_dev->ring\_cache[virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached];
virt\_dev->ring\_cache[virt\_dev->num\_rings\_cached] = NULL;

usb: core: lpm: set lpm\_capable for root hub device
commit 2d2a316765d956bc5cb6bb367b2ec52ca59ab8e9 upstream.
Commit 25cd2882e2fc ("usb/xhci: Change how we indicate a host supports
Link PM.") removed the code to set lpm\_capable for USB 3.0 super-speed
root hub. The intention of that change was to avoid touching usb core
internal field, a.k.a. lpm\_capable, and let usb core to set it by
checking U1 and U2 exit latency values in the descriptor.
Usb core checks and sets lpm\_capable in hub\_port\_init(). Unfortunately,
root hub is a special usb device as it has no parent. Hub\_port\_init()
will never be called for a root hub device. That means lpm\_capable will
by no means be set for the root hub. As the result, lpm isn't functional
at all in Linux kernel.
This patch add the code to check and set lpm\_capable when registering a
root hub device. It could be back-ported to kernels as old as v3.15,
that contains the Commit 25cd2882e2fc ("usb/xhci: Change how we indicate
a host supports Link PM.").

USB: OHCI: Fix race between ED unlink and URB submission
commit 7d8021c967648accd1b78e5e1ddaad655cd2c61f upstream.
This patch fixes a bug introduced by commit 977dcfdc6031 ("USB: OHCI:
don't lose track of EDs when a controller dies"). The commit changed
ed\_state from ED\_UNLINK to ED\_IDLE too early, before finish\_urb() had
been called. The user-visible consequence is that the driver
occasionally crashes or locks up when an URB is submitted while
another URB for the same endpoint is being unlinked.
This patch moves the ED state change later, to the right place. The
drawback is that now we may unnecessarily execute some instructions
multiple times when a controller dies. Since controllers dying is an
exceptional occurrence, a little wasted time won't matter.

usb: core: Fix USB 3.0 devices lost in NOTATTACHED state after a hub port reset
commit fb6d1f7df5d25299fd7b3e84b72b8851d3634764 upstream.
Fix USB 3.0 devices lost in NOTATTACHED state after a hub port reset.
Dissolve the function hub\_port\_finish\_reset() completely and divide the
actions to be taken into those which need to be done after each reset
attempt and those which need to be done after the full procedure is
complete, and place them in the appropriate places in hub\_port\_reset().
Also, remove an unneeded forward declaration of hub\_port\_reset().
Verbose Problem Description:
USB 3.0 devices may be "lost for good" during a hub port reset.
This makes Linux unable to boot from USB 3.0 devices in certain
constellations of host controllers and devices, because the USB device is
lost during initialization, preventing the rootfs from being mounted.
The underlying problem is that in the affected constellations, during the
processing inside hub\_port\_reset(), the hub link state goes from 0 to
SS.inactive after the initial reset, and back to 0 again only after the
following "warm" reset.
However, hub\_port\_finish\_reset() is called after each reset attempt and
sets the state the connected USB device based on the "preliminary" status
of the hot reset to USB\_STATE\_NOTATTACHED due to SS.inactive, yet when
the following warm reset is complete and hub\_port\_finish\_reset() is
called again, its call to set the device to USB\_STATE\_DEFAULT is blocked
by usb\_set\_device\_state() which does not allow taking USB devices out of
USB\_STATE\_NOTATTACHED state.
Thanks to Alan Stern for guiding me to the proper solution and how to
submit it.

usb: dwc3: Reset the transfer resource index on SET\_INTERFACE
commit aebda618718157a69c0dc0adb978d69bc2b8723c upstream.
This fixes an issue introduced in commit b23c843992b6 (usb: dwc3:
gadget: fix DEPSTARTCFG for non-EP0 EPs) that made sure we would
only use DEPSTARTCFG once per SetConfig.
The trick is that we should use one DEPSTARTCFG per SetConfig \*OR\*
SetInterface. SetInterface was completely missed from the original
patch.
This problem became aparent after commit 76e838c9f776 (usb: dwc3:
gadget: return error if command sent to DEPCMD register fails)
added checking of the return status of device endpoint commands.
'Set Endpoint Transfer Resource' command was caught failing
occasionally. This is because the Transfer Resource
Index was not getting reset during a SET\_INTERFACE request.
Finally, to fix the issue, was we have to do is make sure that
our start\_config\_issued flag gets reset whenever we receive a
SetInterface request.
To verify the problem (and its fix), all we have to do is run
test 9 from testusb with 'testusb -t 9 -s 2048 -a -c 5000'.

we must keep DWC3\_EP\_BUSY flag set and this what this patch

libata: add ATA\_HORKAGE\_MAX\_SEC\_1024 to revert back to previous max\_sectors limit
commit af34d637637eabaf49406eb35c948cd51ba262a6 upstream.
Since no longer limiting max\_sectors to BLK\_DEF\_MAX\_SECTORS (commit 34b48db66e08),
data corruption may occur on ST380013AS drive configured on 82801JI (ICH10 Family)
SATA controller. This patch will allow the driver to limit max\_sectors as before
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/max\_sectors\_kb
512
I was able to double the max\_sectors\_kb value up to 16384 on linux-4.2.0-rc2
before seeing corruption, but seems safer to use previous limit. Without this
patch max\_sectors\_kb will be 32767.

libata: increase the timeout when setting transfer mode
commit d531be2ca2f27cca5f041b6a140504999144a617 upstream.
I have a ST4000DM000 disk. If Linux is booted while the disk is spun down,
the command that sets transfer mode causes the disk to spin up. The
spin-up takes longer than the default 5s timeout, so the command fails and
timeout is reported.
Fix this by increasing the timeout to 15s, which is enough for the disk to
spin up.

commit 0574eab363ace70ef275d4caad6eadc458d33728 upstream.
I tried to fix this before and submitted a working patch, but after
some discussion we came up with what seemed to be a nicer solution,
resulting in commit 3d4cf65e2d ("ASoC: omap: fix up
SND\_OMAP\_SOC\_OMAP\_ABE\_TWL6040 dependency"). Unfortunately, that
version was incomplete, and we still get this build error:
drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c:46:16: error: field 'hw' has incomplete type
drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c: In function 'to\_palmas\_clks\_info':
drivers/clk/clk-palmas.c:54:74: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Winc
This happens only in randconfig builds that turn on MFD\_PALMAS
on a platform other than OMAP2+ when COMPILE\_TEST is set
but COMMON\_CLK is not.
The new approach is only 'select COMMON\_CLK\_PALMAS' if we know
that we are on an OMAP5 platform and MFD\_PALMAS is already set.
This patch has survived thousands of randconfig builds and I
don't see a remaining hole in the logic.

warning: (SND\_SOC\_STORM) selects SND\_SOC\_LPASS\_CPU which has unmet direct dependencies (SOUND && !M68K && !UML && SND && SND\_SOC && SND\_SOC\_QCOM)

Dropping the dependencies makes it work without warnings and no

media: Fix regression in some more dib0700 based devices
commit e989a73ebd09d22c22ead51fa363a2f56f70f28a upstream.
Fix an oops during device initialization by correctly setting size\_of\_priv

The regression was introduced by 8abe4a0a3f6d4217b16a ("[media] dib7000:

vb2: Don't WARN when v4l2\_buffer.bytesused is 0 for multiplanar buffers
commit 77a3c6fd90c94f635edb00d4a65f485687538791 upstream.
Commit f61bf13b6a07 ("[media] vb2: add allow\_zero\_bytesused flag to the
vb2\_queue struct") added a WARN\_ONCE to catch usage of a deprecated API
using a zero value for v4l2\_buffer.bytesused.
However, the condition is checked incorrectly, as the v4L2\_buffer
bytesused field is supposed to be ignored for multiplanar buffers. This
results in spurious warnings when using the multiplanar API.
Fix it by checking v4l2\_buffer.bytesused for uniplanar buffers and
v4l2\_plane.bytesused for multiplanar buffers.

commit bdc10d57f236b534fb675a4bbefd10017aeb2b26 upstream.
Current description for proximity measurement is ambiguous. While
the first part says that proximity is measured by observing
reflectivity, the second part incorrectly infers that reported values
should behave like a distance.
This is because of AS3935 lightning sensor which uses the proximity
API, while not being a true proximity sensor.
Note this is marked for stable as it accompanies a fix in ABI usage
to the sx9500 driver which would otherwise appear to be correct.

call \_\_i2c\_transfer() instead. This has a side effect on tracing (messages

i2c: at91: fix a race condition when using the DMA controller
commit 93563a6a71bb69dd324fc7354c60fb05f84aae6b upstream.
For TX transactions, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register is cleared
when the first data is written into the Transmit Holding Register.
In the lines from at91\_do\_twi\_transfer():
at91\_twi\_write\_data\_dma(dev);
at91\_twi\_write(dev, AT91\_TWI\_IER, AT91\_TWI\_TXCOMP);
the TXCOMP interrupt may be enabled before the DMA controller has
actually started to write into the THR. In such a case, the TXCOMP bit
is still set into the Status Register so the interrupt is triggered
immediately. The driver understands that a transaction completion has
occurred but this transaction hasn't started yet. Hence the TXCOMP
interrupt is no longer enabled by at91\_do\_twi\_transfer() but instead
by at91\_twi\_write\_data\_dma\_callback().
Also, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register in not a clear on read flag
but a snapshot of the transmission state at the time the Status
Register is read.
When a NACK error is dectected by the I2C controller, the TXCOMP, NACK
and TXRDY bits are set together to 1 in the SR. If enabled, the TXCOMP
interrupt is triggered at the same time. Also setting the TXRDY to 1
triggers the DMA controller to write the next data into the THR. Such
a write resets the TXCOMP bit to 0 in the SR. So depending on when the
interrupt handler reads the SR, it may fail to detect the NACK error
if it relies on the TXCOMP bit. The NACK bit and its interrupt should
be used instead.
For RX transactions, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register is cleared
when the START bit is set into the Control Register. However to unify
the management of the TXCOMP bit when the DMA controller is used, the
TXCOMP interrupt is now enabled by the DMA callbacks for both TX and
RX transfers.

rtc: snvs: fix wakealarm by call enable\_irq\_wake earlier
commit 119434f44c78df8c4b6d67f835448542a4bd7e91 upstream.
When entering suspend while an wakeup alarm is set, enable\_set\_wake
should make sure that the RTC interrupt keep being enabled and the
.irq\_set\_wake for the RTC interrupt get called. However, since the
driver uses the suspend\_noirq callback, the call to enable\_irq\_wake
has been made after disabling the interrupts. While .irq\_set\_wake
has been called properly, the interrupt remained disabled.
Use the suspend callback to call enable\_irq\_wake early enough to
ensure the RTC interrupt remains enabled.

jbd2: fix ocfs2 corrupt when updating journal superblock fails
commit 6f6a6fda294506dfe0e3e0a253bb2d2923f28f0a upstream.
If updating journal superblock fails after journal data has been
flushed, the error is omitted and this will mislead the caller as a
normal case. In ocfs2, the checkpoint will be treated successfully
and the other node can get the lock to update. Since the sb\_start is
still pointing to the old log block, it will rewrite the journal data
during journal recovery by the other node. Thus the new updates will
be overwritten and ocfs2 corrupts. So in above case we have to return
the error, and ocfs2\_commit\_cache will take care of the error and
prevent the other node to do update first. And only after recovering
journal it can do the new updates.

ext4: correctly migrate a file with a hole at the beginning
commit 8974fec7d72e3e02752fe0f27b4c3719c78d9a15 upstream.
Currently ext4\_ind\_migrate() doesn't correctly handle a file which
contains a hole at the beginning of the file. This caused the migration
to be done incorrectly, and then if there is a subsequent following
delayed allocation write to the "hole", this would reclaim the same data
blocks again and results in fs corruption.
# assmuing 4k block size ext4, with delalloc enabled
# skip the first block and write to the second block
xfs\_io -fc "pwrite 4k 4k" -c "fsync" /mnt/ext4/testfile
# converting to indirect-mapped file, which would move the data blocks
# to the beginning of the file, but extent status cache still marks
# that region as a hole
chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
# delayed allocation writes to the "hole", reclaim the same data block
# again, results in i\_blocks corruption
xfs\_io -c "pwrite 0 4k" /mnt/ext4/testfile
umount /mnt/ext4

ext4: be more strict when migrating to non-extent based file
commit d6f123a9297496ad0b6335fe881504c4b5b2a5e5 upstream.
Currently the check in ext4\_ind\_migrate() is not enough before doing the
real conversion:
a) delayed allocated extents could bypass the check on eh->eh\_entries
and eh->eh\_depth
This can be demonstrated by this script
xfs\_io -fc "pwrite 0 4k" -c "pwrite 8k 4k" /mnt/ext4/testfile
chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
where testfile has two extents but still be converted to non-extent
based file format.
b) only extent length is checked but not the offset, which would result
in data lose (delalloc) or fs corruption (nodelalloc), because
non-extent based file only supports at most (12 + 2^10 + 2^20 + 2^30)
blocks
This can be demostrated by
xfs\_io -fc "pwrite 5T 4k" /mnt/ext4/testfile
chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
sync
If delalloc is enabled, dmesg prints
EXT4-fs warning (device dm-4): ext4\_block\_to\_path:105: block 1342177280 > max in inode 53
EXT4-fs (dm-4): Delayed block allocation failed for inode 53 at logical offset 1342177280 with max blocks 1 with error 5
EXT4-fs (dm-4): This should not happen!! Data will be lost
If delalloc is disabled, e2fsck -nf shows corruption
Inode 53, i\_size is 5497558142976, should be 4096. Fix? no
Fix the two issues by
a) forcing all delayed allocation blocks to be allocated before checking
eh->eh\_depth and eh->eh\_entries
b) limiting the last logical block of the extent is within direct map

ext4: fix reservation release on invalidatepage for delalloc fs
commit 9705acd63b125dee8b15c705216d7186daea4625 upstream.
On delalloc enabled file system on invalidatepage operation
in ext4\_da\_page\_release\_reservation() we want to clear the delayed
buffer and remove the extent covering the delayed buffer from the extent
status tree.
However currently there is a bug where on the systems with page size >
block size we will always remove extents from the start of the page
regardless where the actual delayed buffers are positioned in the page.
This leads to the errors like this:
EXT4-fs warning (device loop0): ext4\_da\_release\_space:1225:
ext4\_da\_release\_space: ino 13, to\_free 1 with only 0 reserved data
blocks
This however can cause data loss on writeback time if the file system is
in ENOSPC condition because we're releasing reservation for someones
else delayed buffer.
Fix this by only removing extents that corresponds to the part of the
page we want to invalidate.
This problem is reproducible by the following fio receipt (however I was
only able to reproduce it with fio-2.1 or older.

bufferhead: Add \_gfp version for sb\_getblk()
commit bd7ade3cd9b0850264306f5c2b79024a417b6396 upstream.
sb\_getblk() is used during ext4 (and possibly other FSes) writeback
paths. Sometimes such path require allocating memory and guaranteeing
that such allocation won't block. Currently, however, there is no way
to provide user flags for sb\_getblk which could lead to deadlocks.
This patch implements a sb\_getblk\_gfp with the only difference it can
accept user-provided GFP flags.

ext4 isn't willing to map clusters to a non-extent file. Don't signal
this with an out of space error, since the FS will retry the
allocation (which didn't fail) forever. Instead, return EUCLEAN so
that the operation will fail immediately all the way back to userspace.

Normally all of the buffers will have been forced out to disk before

still be some dirty buffers in the buffer cache for the device. So
try to force them out to memory before calling invalidate\_bdev().

ext4: fix race between truncate and \_\_ext4\_journalled\_writepage()
commit bdf96838aea6a265f2ae6cbcfb12a778c84a0b8e upstream.
The commit cf108bca465d: "ext4: Invert the locking order of page\_lock
and transaction start" caused \_\_ext4\_journalled\_writepage() to drop
the page lock before the page was written back, as part of changing
the locking order to jbd2\_journal\_start -> page\_lock. However, this
introduced a potential race if there was a truncate racing with the
data=journalled writeback mode.
Fix this by grabbing the page lock after starting the journal handle,
and then checking to see if page had gotten truncated out from under
us.
This fixes a number of different warnings or BUG\_ON's when running
xfstests generic/086 in data=journalled mode, including:

hid-sensor: Fix suspend/resume delay
commit 1e25aa9641e8f3fa39cd5e46b4afcafd7f12a44b upstream.
By default all the sensors are runtime suspended state (lowest power
state). During Linux suspend process, all the run time suspended
devices are resumed and then suspended. This caused all sensors to
power up and introduced delay in suspend time, when we introduced
runtime PM for HID sensors. The opposite process happens during resume
process.
To fix this, we do powerup process of the sensors only when the request
is issued from user (raw or tiggerred). In this way when runtime,
resume calls for powerup it will simply return as this will not match
user requested state.
Note this is a regression fix as the increase in suspend / resume
times can be substantial (report of 8 seconds on Len's laptop!)

staging: comedi: cb\_pcimdas: fix handlers for DI and DO subdevices
commit b08ad6657aacf9b5d7c4b22de2ba891b152d0528 upstream.
Normally, low-level Comedi drivers set an `insn\_bits` handler for
digital input (DI), digital output (DO) and digital input/output (DIO)
subdevice types to handle normal reading and writing of digital
channels. The "cb\_pcimdas" driver currently has an `insn\_read` handler
for the DI subdevice and an `insn\_write` handler for the DO subdevice.
However, the actual handler functions `cb\_pcimdas\_di\_insn\_read()` and
`cb\_pcimdas\_do\_insn\_write()` are written to behave like `insn\_bits`
handlers. Something's wrong there! To fix it, set the functions as
`insn\_bits` handlers and rename them for consistency.

ieee802154: Fix sockaddr\_ieee802154 implicit padding information leak.
commit 8a70cefa3037d62e7c0b6068a66675def1a330c9 upstream.
The AF\_IEEE802154 sockaddr looks like this:
struct sockaddr\_ieee802154 {
sa\_family\_t family; /\* AF\_IEEE802154 \*/
struct ieee802154\_addr\_sa addr;
};
struct ieee802154\_addr\_sa {
int addr\_type;
u16 pan\_id;
union {
u8 hwaddr[IEEE802154\_ADDR\_LEN];
u16 short\_addr;
};
};
On most architectures there will be implicit structure padding here,
in two different places:
\* In struct sockaddr\_ieee802154, two bytes of padding between 'family'
(unsigned short) and 'addr', so that 'addr' starts on a four byte
boundary.
\* In struct ieee802154\_addr\_sa, two bytes at the end of the structure,
to make the structure 16 bytes.
When calling recvmsg(2) on a PF\_IEEE802154 SOCK\_DGRAM socket, the
ieee802154 stack constructs a struct sockaddr\_ieee802154 on the
kernel stack without clearing these padding fields, and, depending
on the addr\_type, between four and ten bytes of uncleared kernel
stack will be copied to userspace.
We can't just insert two 'u16 \_\_pad's in the right places and zero
those before copying an address to userspace, as not all architectures
insert this implicit padding -- from a quick test it seems that avr32,
cris and m68k don't insert this padding, while every other architecture
that I have cross compilers for does insert this padding.
The easiest way to plug the leak is to just memset the whole struct
sockaddr\_ieee802154 before filling in the fields we want to fill in,
and that's what this patch does.

rtlwifi: Remove the clear interrupt routine from all drivers
commit 1277fa2ab2f9a624a4b0177119ca13b5fd65edd0 upstream.
Several of these drivers have there TX randomly blocked for 3~5 seconds while
measuring tx throughput (iperf). The root couse happens in rtl\_pci\_flush().
The function uses a while-loop to wait for TX queue length to decrease to 0.
The TX queue length counts the number of packets that are queued in the driver.
The driver relys on the TX OK interrupt to return skb and reduce TX queue length.
The interrupt subroutine disables interupts, reads the interrupt registers, and
then clears the registers in the beginning of \_rtl\_pci\_interrupt(). After all
interupts process are finished, the driver invokes enable\_interrupt() to enable
interupts. This behavior is normal for an interrupt subroutine.
But enable\_interrupt() invokes clear\_interrupt() again. This unexpected interrupt
clearing may cleari me fresh TX OK interrupts. These missing interrupts cause TX
queue length to never reduce to 0i, which causes rtl\_pci\_flush() to be stuck in
unterminated while-loop.
This patch removes clear\_interrupt() in enable\_interrupt() to avoid this behavior.

The problem is that test\_bit() takes a bit number and not a mask. It
means that when we do:
set\_bit(OP\_TSF\_RESET, &priv->op\_flags);
Then it sets the (1 << 6) bit instead of the 6 bit so we are setting a
bit which is past the end of the unsigned long.

probe isn't critical to operate the chip, this patch just changes
things to carry on when it fails.

Bluetooth: btusb: Fix secure send command length alignment on Intel 8260
commit e66890a96abbb746e1229c3067471be36dc49b34 upstream.
This patch fixes the command length alignment issue for Intel Bluetooth
8260.
The length of parameters in the firmware downloading command must be
multiplication of 4. If not, the command must append Intel\_NOP command
with extra parameters, zeros, at the end, and the firmware file is
already included Intel\_NOP command for alignment.
This patch checks the next command and if the next command is Intel\_NOP
command, it reads the Intel\_NOP command and send them together.
For example, if the data from the firmware file looks like this:
8E FC 03 11 22 33 02 FC 03 00 00 00
Previously, btusb sends two commands:
09 FC 06 8E FC 03 11 22 33
09 FC 06 02 FC 03 00 00 00
This won't work because the length of parameters are 6 which violates
the 4 byte alignment.
This patch will append them together and send as one command:
09 FC 0C 8E FC 03 11 22 33 02 FC 03 00 00 00

Bluetooth: Fix race condition with user channel and setup stage
commit 781f899f2f9d8b71e35225a087f90052059486c5 upstream.
During the initial setup stage of a controller, the low-level transport
is actually active. This means that HCI\_UP is true. To avoid toggling
the transport off and back on again for normal operation the kernel
holds a grace period with HCI\_AUTO\_OFF that will turn the low-level
transport off in case no user is present.
The idea of the grace period is important to avoid having to initialize
all of the controller twice. So legacy ioctl and the new management
interface knows how to clear this grace period and then start normal
operation.
For the user channel operation this grace period has not been taken into
account which results in the problem that HCI\_UP and HCI\_AUTO\_OFF are
set and the kernel will return EBUSY. However from a system point of
view the controller is ready to be grabbed by either the ioctl, the
management interface or the user channel.
This patch brings the user channel to the same level as the other two
entries for operating a controller.

m68knommu: force setting of CONFIG\_CLOCK\_FREQ for ColdFire
commit d9ee489619744ee5ac246b8fb3dd65bb078d2f0a upstream.
It is possible to disable the clock selection at configuration time,
but for ColdFire targets we always expect a clock frequency to be
selected. This results in the following compile time error:

m68knommu: make ColdFire SoC selection a choice
commit fa95a1dd0819c9041a873b10a6d83b5134964154 upstream.
It would be nice if we could support multiple ColdFire SoC types in a
single binary - but currently the code simply does not support it.
Change the SoC selection config options to be a choice instead of
individual selectable entries.
This fixes problems with building allnoconfig, and means that a sane
linux kernel is generated for a single ColdFire SoC type.

A new revision of the Marvell Armada 38x hardware datasheet unveiled

Some PCIe functions simply do not exist, some of the PCIe functions in

have been added.

this function is in fact implemented on MPP43, instead of a PCIe

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# Android Security Bulletin—January 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 03, 2017 | Updated February 2, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of January 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on December 05,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-01-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-01-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the January
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Security vulnerability summary

The tables below contains a list of security vulnerabilities, the Common
Vulnerability and Exposures ID (CVE), the assessed severity, and whether or not
Google devices are affected. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with

  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

| CVE-2016-8475 | A-32591129\* | Moderate | Pixel, Pixel XL | Oct 30, 2016 |

\* The patch for this issue is not publicly available. The update is contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

### Denial of service vulnerability in kernel file system

A denial of service vulnerability in the kernel file system could enable a
local malicious application to cause a device hang or reboot. This issue is
rated as Moderate because it is a temporary denial of service that requires a
factory reset to fix.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-01-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-01-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the January 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of January 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-01-01](#2017-01-01-details) and
[2017-01-05](#2017-01-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running the
  latest available version of Android are affected by the issue, the table
  will have "None" in the *Updated Google devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mappingReading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
the VMA doesn't have vm\_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
do\_anonymous\_page().
Let's change page fault handler to use do\_anonymous\_page() only on
anonymous VMA (->vm\_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
shared.
For file mappings without vm\_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm\_ops,
page fault on pte\_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.

mm/memory.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.4 mishandles anonymous pages,
which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
(page tainting) via a crafted application that triggers writing to page
zero.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Kirill A. Shutemov discovered that memory manager in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle anonymous pages. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative privileges.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:49:56 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that there is a way to arbitrary change zero page memory. Zero page is a page which kernel maps into virtual address space on read page fault if the page was not allocated before. Kernel has one zero page which used everywhere. Programs that map 0 page are affected and code execution can be gained. Upon running the exploit the system may become unusable as the linker memory pages gets tainted. Furthermore, if the right code is put in the 0 page, code execution is possible.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c1)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:50:23 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Kirill A. Shutemov (Intel)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c2)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:52:09 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6b7339f4c31ad69c8e9c0b2859276e22cf72176d>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c3)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:55:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and MRG-2. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:49:56 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that there is a way to arbitrary change zero page memory. Zero page is a page which kernel maps into virtual address space on read page fault if the page was not allocated before. Kernel has one zero page which used everywhere. Programs that map 0 page are affected and code execution can be gained. Upon running the exploit the system may become unusable as the linker memory pages gets tainted. Furthermore, if the right code is put in the 0 page, code execution is possible.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1333830#c1)  Vladis Dronov    2016-05-06 13:50:23 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Kirill A.

mm: avoid setting up anonymous pages into file mapping

```
Reading page fault handler code I've noticed that under right
circumstances kernel would map anonymous pages into file mappings: if
the VMA doesn't have vm_ops->fault() and the VMA wasn't fully populated
on ->mmap(), kernel would handle page fault to not populated pte with
do_anonymous_page().

Let's change page fault handler to use do_anonymous_page() only on
anonymous VMA (->vm_ops == NULL) and make sure that the VMA is not
shared.

For file mappings without vm_ops->fault() or shred VMA without vm_ops,
page fault on pte_none() entry would lead to SIGBUS.
