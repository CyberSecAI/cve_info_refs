        "vulnerability": "Multiple insecure /tmp file usage issues in OpenStack Trove.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of temporary files in various modules of OpenStack Trove, specifically in the guest agent.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insecure creation and handling of temporary files in /tmp directory.",
           "Hardcoded file paths",
           "Lack of proper permission handling for temporary files."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could potentially tamper with the contents of the temporary files or create the files before the legitimate process, leading to the injection of attacker-controlled configurations. This could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges or disrupt the database operations.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Local access to the filesystem of a Trove instance.",
          "Ability to create or manipulate files in the /tmp directory.",
          "Possibly through accessible database features to coax symlink creation."
        ],
         "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires shell access to a Trove instance and the ability to manipulate files within the /tmp directory.  This might require administrative privileges on the guest instance, but a less privileged user might be able to exploit using symlink attacks.",
         "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects multiple datastore modules (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, Cassandra, Couchbase). Upstream did not consider it a security issue due to the assumption of restricted access to Trove instances. Red Hat has tracked this issue as a security vulnerability."

        "source": "bugs.launchpad.net_d8a5b724_20250125_124508.html",
        "vulnerability": "Insecure temporary file usage in Cassandra datastore",
          "root_cause": "The code writes configuration to a hardcoded file in /tmp, and then copies it to another hardcoded path using sudo.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Hardcoded temporary file paths in /tmp.",
          "Lack of proper security measures for temporary file creation.",
          "Potential race condition in file creation."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could tamper with the contents of the temporary file or create the file before the legitimate code, leading to the injection of malicious configuration data into Cassandra. ",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Local access to the filesystem.",
          "Ability to write to the /tmp directory.",
           "Potential symlink attack."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires access to the file system of a Trove instance where the guest agent runs. While typically this instance would not have untrusted local users, there may be some accessible database features capable of coaxing symlink creation.",
           "additional_details": " The OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team initially did not request a CVE, considering it low risk due to deployment setups restricting file access and SSH access to the Trove instance. However, a fix was implemented in the master branch for the Kilo release."
