{
  "CVE-2015-3145": {
    "description": "When parsing HTTP cookies, if the parsed cookie's \"path\" element consists of a single double-quote, libcurl would try to write to an invalid heap memory address. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash). This issue only affects the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.",
    "affected_versions": "from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.41.0",
    "fixed_versions": "libcurl >= 7.42.0",
     "root_cause": "The `sanitize_cookie_path()` function in libcurl does not properly validate input. If a cookie path consists of only a double quote, the function will index allocated memory with -1, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash). Potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted cookie with a path element consisting only of a double quote."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to influence the cookie path parsed by libcurl, either by controlling a web server or by other means."
