- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Janitza UMG devices expose an FTP interface that is protected by a hard-coded, undocumented default password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the FTP interface can upload and download arbitrary files, potentially leading to full control of the device. This can compromise the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the device and dependent systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access via the FTP interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs network access to the device and the knowledge of the hard-coded password. No authentication is required beyond providing the default password.
