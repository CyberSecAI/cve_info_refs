=================================================
OSSA-2015-010: XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation
=================================================

:Date: June 09, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3219

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Horizon: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By
tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the
Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger
a cross-site-scripting vulnerability during the stack creation. It may
result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only
setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.

- <https://review.openstack.org/189822> (Kilo)
- <https://review.openstack.org/189820> (Liberty)

Credits
~~~~~~~
- Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis (CVE-2015-3219)

~~~~~
- This fix will be included in future 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.1
  (kilo) releases.

=================================================
OSSA-2015-010: XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation
=================================================

:Date: June 09, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3219

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Horizon: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By
tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the
Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger
a cross-site-scripting vulnerability during the stack creation. It may
result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only
setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.

Patches

### Bug Description

The Field class help\_text attribute is vulnerable to code injection if the text is somehow taken from the user input.

Heat UI allows to create stacks from the user input which define parameters. Those parameters are then converted to the input field which are vulnerable.

The heat stack example exploit:

description: Does not matter

heat\_template\_version: '2013-05-23'

outputs: {}

parameters:

  param1:

    type: string

    label: normal\_label

    description: hack="><script>alert('YOUR HORIZON IS PWNED')</script>"

resources: {}

Is the implication here that use of untrusted Heat stacks is normally considered safe practice?

Oh, I see. The risk is exposed in Horizon itself, that a malicious user could create such a stack and then convince another user or administrator to browse it through the UI triggering possible cross-site scripting attacks, et cetera.

The stack templates may also be downloaded from the insecure resource via http and if there is a MitM attack going on on that resource the heat template using this exploit may be obtained.

Django security team has pointed out that it's a documented behavior on the Django side.

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#help-text>

So it looks like that Horizon should care about escaping the values for the help\_text.

At least Juno and Kilo are affected, is Icehouse also affected ?

Assuming the description field is only rendered during the stack creation and there is no other ways to make it's content executed (like through a show\_info url), here is the impact description draft:

The patch in #9 applies cleanly on Juno too.

The vulnerable code seems also present in Icehouse but I couldn't reproduce the bug there, can someone please check if Icehouse is also affected ?

Tristan: Icehouse is not affected, this is because the help\_text is always escaped on HTML template.

Juno - assume that help text is always safe:

        <span class="help-icon" data-toggle="tooltip"

              data-placement="top" title="{{ field.help\_text|safe }}">

Icehouse - always escape the text:

        <span class="help-block">{% filter force\_escape %} {{ field.help\_text }} {% endfilter %} </span>

Escape the description param from heat template

The heat template allows user to define custom parameters,

    the fields are then converted to input fields. The description

    param maps to the help\_text attribute of the field.

Since the value comes from the user, the value must be escaped

    before rendering.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1243301#c0)  Martin Schuppert    2015-07-15 07:25:29 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When logging into horizon, horizon sends an API request to nova inquiring about usage statistics. Among the api requests is os-simple-tenant-usage. We see that, if there are thousands of deleted VMs in the nova DB, this api call makes the nova-api process memory consumption skyrocket. If there are enough deleted VMs in the DB the nova-api eventually crashes due to lack of memory.  I was able to reproduce this in a lab setup (by running a script that creates many VMs and then deletes them continuously). I was also able to make the problem go away by deleting the VM entries from the nova database.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): OSP6   Proposed fix - <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/201221/>  ~~~ Add an OPENSTACK_SIMPLE_TENANT_USAGE_ENABLED settings option   The users may want to disable the simple tenant usage display for efficiency reasons -- currently this gets very slow and may run out of memory if there are a lot of deleted machines in the Nova database.  In the 2.0 API we can disable it on the Nova side, but it won't be possible anymore with the 2.1 API. ~~~    Additional info: related to [BZ1154237](show_bug.cgi?id=1154237)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1243301#c2)  Radomir Dopieralski    2015-07-15 08:16:58 UTC  ``` We came up with a more generic solution:  ~~~ Add OPENSTACK_NOVA_EXTENSIONS_BLACKLIST option to settings  This lets us disable any Nova extension we like, not just the simple tenant usage. ~~~   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1243301#c10)  Radomir Dopieralski    2015-08-14 07:14:29 UTC  ``` The patch has been merged upstream.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1243301#c12)  Ido Ovadia    2015-08-19 15:01:33 UTC  ``` Verified ======== openstack-dashboard-2014.2.3-6.1.el7ost.noarch python-django-horizon-2014.2.3-6.1.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1243301#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-24 20:16:22 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:58:08 UTC  ``` By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability during the stack creation. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035037](attachment.cgi?id=1035037 "cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035037&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch") cve-2015-3219-master-liberty.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035038](attachment.cgi?id=1035038 "cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035038&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch") cve-2015-3219-stable-juno.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-06-05 06:59:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1035039](attachment.cgi?id=1035039 "cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1035039&action=edit "cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch") cve-2015-3219-stable-kilo.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-11 04:43:01 UTC  ``` This is public now:  <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2015-010.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2015-06-11 22:31:53 UTC  ```  Created python-django-horizon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1230971](show_bug.cgi?id=1230971 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2015-3219 python-django-horizon: XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c7)  Garth Mollett    2015-06-11 22:42:39 UTC  ```  Created python-django-horizon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1230973](show_bug.cgi?id=1230973)]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c8)  Ido Ovadia    2015-06-14 14:58:02 UTC  ``` Verified ======== python-django-horizon-2015.1.0-10.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1228534#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-24 20:16:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:1679 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1679.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

### Bug Description

The Field class help\_text attribute is vulnerable to code injection if the text is somehow taken from the user input.

Heat UI allows to create stacks from the user input which define parameters. Those parameters are then converted to the input field which are vulnerable.

The heat stack example exploit:

description: Does not matter

heat\_template\_version: '2013-05-23'

outputs: {}

parameters:

  param1:

    type: string

    label: normal\_label

    description: hack="><script>alert('YOUR HORIZON IS PWNED')</script>"

resources: {}

Oh, I see. The risk is exposed in Horizon itself, that a malicious user could create such a stack and then convince another user or administrator to browse it through the UI triggering possible cross-site scripting attacks, et cetera.

The stack templates may also be downloaded from the insecure resource via http and if there is a MitM attack going on on that resource the heat template using this exploit may be obtained.

Django security team has pointed out that it's a documented behavior on the Django side.

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#help-text>

So it looks like that Horizon should care about escaping the values for the help\_text.

At least Juno and Kilo are affected, is Icehouse also affected ?

Assuming the description field is only rendered during the stack creation and there is no other ways to make it's content executed (like through a show\_info url), here is the impact description draft:

Title: XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation

Reporter: Nikita Konovalov (Mirantis)

Products: Horizon

Affects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0

Description:

Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability during the stack creation. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.

Tristan: Icehouse is not affected, this is because the help\_text is always escaped on HTML template.

Juno - assume that help text is always safe:

        <span class="help-icon" data-toggle="tooltip"

              data-placement="top" title="{{ field.help\_text|safe }}">

Icehouse - always escape the text:

        <span class="help-block">{% filter force\_escape %} {{ field.help\_text }} {% endfilter %} </span>

Escape the description param from heat template

The heat template allows user to define custom parameters,

    the fields are then converted to input fields. The description

    param maps to the help\_text attribute of the field.

Since the value comes from the user, the value must be escaped

    before rendering.

Change abandoned by Ian Cordasco (<email address hidden>) on branch: stable/icehouse

Review: <https://review.openstack.org/189985>

Reason: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/78b6f5ed6145dcb2e9ce2caed0c87d159c12697b/horizon/templates/horizon/common/_form_fields.html#L27> shows that this isn't a problem because the template escapes this. The notice was misleading in not excluding Icehouse from the list of affected versions.

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix multiple security issues
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

Two security issues were discovered in the Horizon dashboard and are
addressed in this update:

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Horizon Orchestration

dashboard. An attacker able to trick a Horizon user into using a malicious
template during the stack creation could use this flaw to perform an XSS
attack on that user. (CVE-2015-3219)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting the
CVE-2015-3219 issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis
as the original reporter of CVE-2015-3219.

* A flaw was discovered in the Horizon metadata dashboard whereby

potentially untrusted data was displayed from Glance images, Nova flavors,
or host aggregates without correct clean up. An attacker could use this
flaw to conduct an XSS attack.(CVE-2015-3988)

Additionally, the following non-security issues are addressed:

* It was impossible to associate a floating IP address to a port for an

instance. This occurred if the gateway router was not in the same tenant as
the instance but was attached to a network shared across tenants because
only ports within the tenant were used to find reachable gateway routers.
(BZ#1187992)

* If two or more regions were configured in Horizon, then the User, Help,

and Current Project links would no longer work and the region selector
was in the wrong location in the UI. (BZ#1189887)

* A load balancer monitor was erroneously displayed as associated with

every tenant in every pool. The load balancer monitor was not actually
associated with any tenants, but the improper display prevented users
from using the Horizon dashboard to create a tenant association.
(BZ#1196249)

* When logging into the Horizon dashboard, Horizon sends a query to Nova to

update usage statistics. One of the calls would erroneously query deleted
virtual machines; if there were thousands of deleted virtual machines, the
CPU usage for Nova would spike and the Nova process could crash.
(BZ#1243301)

* The network profile was not supported by Cisco N1KV ML2 drivers. This

profile has been removed to maintain Horizon compatibility with the Cisco
driver. (BZ#1246690)

* A neutron attribute extension was renamed from profile\_id to profile for

networks and ports. This caused create operations for networks and ports to
fail from the dashboard since the dashboard was still using the attribute
name n1kv:profile\_id rather than n1kv:profile.(BZ#1248367)

* If a virtual machine instance failed to launch, then the stale port

assignments were left in the configuration rather than being cleaned up.
(BZ#1249228)

All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.
