  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-3219",
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon). By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability during the stack creation. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Horizon: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and version 2015.1.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `help_text` attribute of the Field class in Horizon was vulnerable to code injection. The Horizon Heat UI allowed users to define parameters in heat stack templates, and these parameters were then converted to input fields. The `description` parameter in the heat template was mapped to the `help_text` attribute of the field without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a cross-site scripting vulnerability during stack creation, potentially leading to the theft of user credentials and other assets.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Heat template and convince a Horizon user to use it."
