  "CVE-2015-3091": {
    "Description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 17.0.0.172 do not properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3092.",
    "Root cause": "Memory address disclosure due to insufficient restrictions on memory address discovery.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information leak",
       "Insufficient restriction of memory address discovery",
      "ASLR bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "Bypassing ASLR protection making it easier to exploit other flaws.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted SWF file",
      "Unspecified vectors"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
