  "CVE-2015-3627": {
    "description": "Libcontainer and Docker Engine before 1.6.1 opens the file-descriptor passed to the pid-1 process before performing the chroot, which allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack in an image.",

    "description": "Libcontainer 1.6.0, as used in Docker Engine, allows local users to escape containerization ('mount namespace breakout') and write to arbitrary file on the host system via a symlink attack in an image when respawning a container.",

    "description": "Docker Engine before 1.6.1 uses weak permissions for (1) /proc/asound, (2) /proc/timer_stats, (3) /proc/latency_stats, and (4) /proc/fs, which allows local users to modify the host, obtain sensitive information, and perform protocol downgrade attacks via a crafted image.",
