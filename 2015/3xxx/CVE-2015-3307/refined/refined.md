{
  "CVE-2015-3307": {
    "Description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way the way PHP's Phar extension parsed Phar archives. A specially crafted archive could cause PHP to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory corruption issue exists within the phar_tar_process_metadata() function, specifically when handling tar file metadata.  The code incorrectly frees memory leading to a double free or use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause a PHP application to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code, by supplying a maliciously crafted Phar archive.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by making a PHP application process a specially crafted Phar archive.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to make a PHP application process the malicious Phar file."
