Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-3952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**. Specifically, wireless keys are stored in plain text on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** Wireless keys are stored in plain text, making them easily accessible if an attacker gains access to the device's storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information (wireless keys), potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the wireless network the device is connected to. This could then be used for further attacks targeting the devices themselves or the network.
*   The impact is rated as partial for confidentiality and partial for integrity. There is no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, specifically over the wireless network that the affected device is connected to. The attack vector is network-based, requiring no prior physical access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The attacker needs a low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Hospira's Plum A+, Plum A+3, and Symbiq Infusion Systems.
*   The CVSS v2 base score for this vulnerability is 6.4, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N).
*   The advisory recommends closing unused ports and implementing network segmentation as mitigation.
