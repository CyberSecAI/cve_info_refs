Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-3976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability stems from the web interface of the GE Multilink switches not properly neutralizing input during web page generation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web content into specific pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before it's rendered in the web interface. This allows the execution of malicious scripts within the context of the affected web pages.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** Specifically, this is a reflected XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is injected through the request, and executed when the server renders the malicious input in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Injection:**  A malicious user can inject arbitrary web content into the web interface pages.
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** This injected content can contain malicious scripts, allowing an attacker to potentially compromise other users of the web interface by delivering malicious scripts or content to them.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By controlling the content of web pages, the attacker might be able to perform further attacks, like session hijacking, credential harvesting, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, likely via HTTP requests.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack targets the web interface of the GE Multilink switches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the switch's web interface.
*   **Low Skill:** The advisory mentions that an attacker with low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Authenticated User (for exploitation):** The CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S) indicates that the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability successfully.
