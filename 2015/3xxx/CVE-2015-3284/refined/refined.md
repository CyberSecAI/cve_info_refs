Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3284:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from how the OpenAFS kernel extension handles `pioctl` calls.
- When a `pioctl` call is made, the kernel allocates a buffer to hold the anticipated return data. However, the size of this buffer can be larger than the actual data returned.
- This leads to the kernel returning not only the intended data but also the residual content of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Leak:** The core weakness is a memory leak where kernel memory contents are unintentionally disclosed to the user-space caller.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Kernel Memory Exposure:** Sensitive information residing in kernel memory, such as stack data or private pool memory, could be exposed to local users. This leaked data may contain confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to execute commands that make the vulnerable `pioctl` calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be a local user capable of executing commands that trigger the vulnerable `pioctl` calls.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects OpenAFS versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.12.
- The fix is available in OpenAFS version 1.6.13 and as a patch.
- This vulnerability is specific to client platforms using the OpenAFS kernel extension.
- Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA 3320-1) addressing this vulnerability in affected versions.
