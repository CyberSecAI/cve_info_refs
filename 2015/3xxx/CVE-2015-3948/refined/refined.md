The provided content is related to CVE-2015-3948.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). The web server doesn't filter user input correctly, allowing a malicious user to inject scripts into web pages.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
*   Information disclosure
*   Session hijacking
*   Malware distribution
*   Defacement of the website
*   Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application through user input fields which are not properly sanitized or encoded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject input that is later displayed on the web page. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required, as the victim needs to browse a crafted web page, or click a link containing the payload.
