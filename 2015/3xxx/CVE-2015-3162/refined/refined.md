Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-3162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of HTML tags within recipe set comments when displayed in the "edit comment" dialog. The application was not treating the comments as plain text but instead as HTML, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw where arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, can be injected via recipe set comments.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (comments) by escaping HTML special characters before rendering the comments in the "edit comment" dialog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through comments. When a user interacts with the comment (specifically by editing it) or the page, the injected script could execute in the user's browser.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, depending on the attacker's goals and the permissions of the user viewing the comment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Comment Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, into recipe set comments.
- **User Interaction:** The exploit is triggered when a user views the job page and interacts with the comment functionality, specifically when they try to edit the comment. This is because, on edit, the comment is populated into a text area without proper sanitization, resulting in execution of injected Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Beaker system, as only authenticated users are able to submit jobs and comment on them.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information contains details about the fix, which involves treating recipe set comments as plain text instead of HTML, ensuring proper escaping of HTML characters.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Beaker version 20.1.
- The bug report specifically highlights that this vulnerability allowed for `<script>` injection, confirming the XSS impact.
- The provided patch diff shows that the `html()` method was replaced with `text()` when displaying the comment and editing, which is a fix to avoid interpreting the string as HTML.
