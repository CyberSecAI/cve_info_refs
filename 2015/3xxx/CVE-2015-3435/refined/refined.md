Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-3435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the ActiveMQ Broker service, which is part of the Samsung Security Manager product. The service improperly handles HTTP PUT and MOVE requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** By sending crafted HTTP PUT and/or MOVE requests, an attacker can create arbitrary files on the server. The content of these files is controlled by the attacker.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By creating arbitrary files, attackers can leverage this to execute code on the server as the SYSTEM user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain complete control of the system where Samsung Security Manager is installed.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is launched remotely over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system running Samsung Security Manager.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication credentials.

**Summary:**

The Samsung Security Manager suffers from a remote code execution vulnerability due to the lack of proper handling of HTTP PUT and MOVE requests by the embedded ActiveMQ service. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to create arbitrary files with attacker controlled content and further leverage this to execute arbitrary code with system level privileges gaining complete control of the server.
