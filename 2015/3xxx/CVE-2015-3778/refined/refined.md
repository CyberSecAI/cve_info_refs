  "CVE-2015-3778": {
    "Description": "Upon connecting to a Wi-Fi network, MAC addresses of previously accessed networks may have been broadcast. This issue was addressed by broadcasting only MAC addresses associated with the current SSID.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The device was broadcasting MAC addresses of previously accessed networks when connecting to a new Wi-Fi network.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability was in the bootp (Bootstrap Protocol) service where it was not properly handling the broadcast of MAC addresses related to Wi-Fi network connections.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker may be able to determine Wi-Fi networks a device has previously accessed.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through passive observation when a vulnerable device connects to a Wi-Fi network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to passively observe the Wi-Fi network traffic and needs no special privileges or access to the device."
