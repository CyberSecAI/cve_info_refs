      "Inefficient Regular Expression: The regular expression used for URL validation was not optimized for performance, leading to excessive processing time."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS). An attacker could provide a specially crafted URL that causes the validator to take an extremely long time to process, potentially exhausting server resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted URLs to the vulnerable URL validator.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with arbitrary URLs to an application using the vulnerable validator."
