{
  "CVE-2015-5276": {
    "description": "The std::random_device class in libstdc++ in the GNU Compiler Collection (aka GCC) before 4.9.4 does not properly handle short reads from blocking sources, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the random values via unspecified vectors.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `std::random_device` implementation in libstdc++ did not check the return code of the read operation from the designated random file. It also did not retry short reads.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of short reads from blocking sources",
        "Lack of proper error checking on read operations",
	"Missing retry logic for short reads"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability results in predictable random values, making it easier for attackers to guess the output generated by `std::random_device`.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by observing the output of `std::random_device` when it fails to read sufficient bytes and then using this information to predict future values",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to observe or infer the output of `std::random_device`. Context-dependent, meaning exploitation requires knowledge or control of the environment where the application is running."

    "affected_versions": [
      "GCC before 4.9.4"

       ],
     "fix_description": "The fix involves checking the return code from the read operation, throwing an exception if a random number could not be obtained, and retrying if a short read occurs."
