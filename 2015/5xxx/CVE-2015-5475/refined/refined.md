Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-5475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the user and group rights management pages of Request Tracker (RT).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when rendering the user and group rights management pages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **JavaScript Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
*   **User Interface Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript can manipulate the RT user interface, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft through keystroke logging or form hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Unauthorized actions within the application on behalf of the user.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** Injected scripts can potentially capture user session cookies or credentials, leading to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the web interface of Request Tracker (RT), specifically the user and group rights management pages.
*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code as input within the vulnerable pages. The specific method for doing this is not detailed in the provided content, but could involve exploiting existing forms or other input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the RT System:** The attacker needs to have access to the RT system and be able to navigate to the user and group rights management pages.
*   **Injection Capability:** The attacker must be able to inject malicious javascript code into the application via an existing input/form field.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions another XSS vulnerability related to the cryptography interface but specifies that CVE-2015-5475 is related to the user and group rights management pages.
*   The vulnerability affects RT versions 4.0.0 and above.
*   Patches and updated versions were released to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Marcin KopeÄ‡ at Data Reliance Shared Service Center.
