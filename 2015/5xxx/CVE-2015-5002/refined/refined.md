- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in the IBM Rational Host On-Demand administrative interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary script code within a victim's web browser, in the security context of the hosting website. This could lead to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL is used to inject malicious script. The victim needs to click the malicious link for the attack to be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and deliver it to the victim. The victim must click on the URL to trigger the attack.
