{
  "CVE-2015-5522": {
    "Description": "Multiple memory corruption issues existed in tidy. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.",
    "Root cause": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability occurs due to a negative length value being converted to an unsigned integer, leading to an extremely large allocation. The subsequent memory corruption occurs within the `tmbstrndup` function, which copies data into the allocated buffer.  The loop condition `len-- > 0` does not account for the wrap-around from a negative value to a large positive value, and the copy continues past the intended buffer size. In the case of a zero-byte allocation `malloc(0)` returning a valid pointer, the copy operation will also corrupt the heap.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
       "Use of an unsigned integer where a signed integer should be used",
      "Incorrect loop boundary check"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, leading to potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted HTML file or data by HTML Tidy library, or an application using the library.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a crafted input to an application using the vulnerable library."
