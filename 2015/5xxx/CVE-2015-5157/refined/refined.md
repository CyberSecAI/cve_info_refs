Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5157:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided text contains multiple references to **CVE-2015-5157**, and the description of the vulnerability matches the official description: "An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPs), corruption, or potentially escalate privileges on the system.". The vulnerability involves incorrect handling of NMI (non-maskable interrupts) during IRET faults when interrupting user space.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an incorrect handling of IRET faults during the processing of NMIs (non-maskable interrupts) when an interrupt occurs while in userspace. Specifically, the kernel mishandles the situation when an NMI interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
   - Incorrect NMI handling during an IRET fault when interrupting userspace
   - Vulnerable code is in `arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S`

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Denial of service (kernel oops/system crash)
   - Potential privilege escalation
   - Memory corruption.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - Local access: An unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability.
  
**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system. The attacker does not need special privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   Several sources state that this issue is related to x86_64 architecture.
*   The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's NMI (non-maskable interrupt) handling mechanism.
*   Some sources specify the issue can lead to a "kernel oops" or "system crash".
*   Some sources also mention "corruption" and "potential privilege escalation" as a potential impact.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user by exploiting an IRET fault when a NMI happens while in userspace.

In summary, CVE-2015-5157 is a critical vulnerability in the Linux kernel which allows a local unprivileged user to trigger a kernel crash and potentially escalate privileges. This is due to incorrect NMI handling when an IRET fault occurs during user space execution.
