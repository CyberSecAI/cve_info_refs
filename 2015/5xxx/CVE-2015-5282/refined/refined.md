Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5282:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Foreman handles the display of parameter values when toggling the "hide/show" checkbox in the user interface. Specifically, the application fails to properly escape HTML content stored within these parameter values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious HTML or JavaScript code can be injected into a parameter value, and this code will be executed within the browser of any user who interacts with the hide/show checkbox for that parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize user-provided input, specifically parameter values, before displaying them in the UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a legitimate user's session. This could lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying data displayed on the page or initiating actions on behalf of the victim.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the visual presentation of the Foreman interface for other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **UI Interaction:** The attack vector involves manipulating a "hide/show" checkbox in the Foreman user interface.
- **Stored Payload:** The malicious code is stored within a parameter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Foreman:** The attacker requires access to the Foreman application to be able to set the value of a parameter.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires another user to interact with the "hide/show" checkbox after the malicious parameter value has been stored.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in the `hidden_values.js` file which handles the switching between password fields and textareas for hidden values
- The fix involved modifying `hidden_values.js` to use jQuery to generate the input elements instead of directly embedding the source value in a string, which prevents code execution of any HTML tags in the source.
- The vulnerability affects Foreman versions 1.7.0 and higher, and was fixed in 1.10.0.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as having a "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability is described in detail on the Foreman project's security page.
- The patch for this vulnerability is available on GitHub.
