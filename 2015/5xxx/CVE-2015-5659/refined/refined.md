Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in Pref Shimane CMS. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized input, enabling attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** A successful attack would allow a logged-in attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the backend database.
- **Data Breach and Modification:** This could lead to the unauthorized retrieval, modification, or deletion of sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Potential System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain further access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **SQL Injection via crafted input:** The attacker sends malicious input through the application's interface, which gets incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the CMS. This means that the vulnerability can be exploited by an authorized user of the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of the CMS and its Input mechanisms:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQL injection payload to perform their desired action.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Affected Products:** Pref Shimane CMS version 2.0.0 is vulnerable. Versions 1.x are not affected. The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1.
- **Vulnerability Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Shoji Baba.
- **Fix:** The fix involves updating to version 2.0.1, which includes sanitization for user input used in database queries.
- **Code Changes:**  The code changes (commit 5ec03cb) highlight modifications to  `pref-shimane-cms/app/controllers/concerns/susanoo/pages_controller.rb` where input parameters for order columns and directions are now validated, preventing injection. Specifically, the `valid_order_params?` function explicitly checks the `order_column` and `order_direction` against lists of allowed values, effectively preventing SQL injection.
