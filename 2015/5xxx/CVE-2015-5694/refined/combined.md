| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c0)  Florian Weimer    2015-07-21 14:31:27 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the Designate component in OpenStack would enter an infinite loop when processing an internal zone file transfer if a managed DNS zone included a resource record set whose size exceeded the limitations of the DNS protocol, leading to a denial of service.  Only authenticated users with access to the Designate component can add such resource record sets.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:33:40 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/226>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:34:30 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/designate/+bug/1471161](https://bugs.launchpad.net/designate/%2Bbug/1471161)  External References:  <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack/2015-July/013548.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:37:34 UTC  ```  Created openstack-designate tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1247952](show_bug.cgi?id=1247952)]   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1158204#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-12-02 15:45:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-5694  It was discovered that the Designate component in OpenStack would enter an infinite loop when processing an internal zone file transfer if a managed DNS zone included a resource record set whose size exceeded the limitations of the DNS protocol, leading to a denial of service.  Only authenticated users with access to the Designate component can add such resource record sets.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
