Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that OpenStack Designate does not enforce DNS protocol limits regarding the size of record sets. This allows for the creation of resource record sets exceeding the allowed size in DNS, which leads to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Designate fails to properly validate the size of resource record sets against the limitations defined by the DNS protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. When Designate processes an internal zone file transfer with oversized record sets, it enters an infinite loop, making the service unresponsive.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The infinite loop consumes system resources, further contributing to the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a DNS zone file transfer containing the oversized records to the Designate service.
*   **Authenticated Users:** Only authenticated users with access to the Designate component can add such resource record sets initially through the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to manage DNS zones and add resource records within the Designate service.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the `desginate-mdns` component where the rendering loop fails to progress when it encounters resource record sets that are larger than the allowed DNS protocol limit. The lack of enforcement of these DNS limits leads to the infinite loop, causing the DoS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how Designate handles zone file transfers, particularly when large resource record sets are encountered.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
