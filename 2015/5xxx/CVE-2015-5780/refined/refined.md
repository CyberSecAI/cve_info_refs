The provided content is related to CVE-2015-5780.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A validated, user-installed Safari extension could be replaced on disk without prompting the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of Safari extensions, allowing a malicious actor to replace a legitimate extension.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can replace a legitimate user-installed Safari extension on disk without any user interaction, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data theft.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have some level of access to the target system to manipulate files related to the Safari extension. The attacker does not need to have privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the user's system and the ability to manipulate files on the disk. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
