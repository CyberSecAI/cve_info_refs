- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Connections to Xcode Server were made without encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of encryption on network connections to Xcode Server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position may be able to inspect traffic to Xcode Server.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack via a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs a privileged network position to intercept unencrypted traffic.
