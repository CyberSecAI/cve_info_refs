  "CVE-2015-5291": {
    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in PolarSSL 1.x before 1.2.17 and ARM mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before 1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2 allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long hostname to the server name indication (SNI) extension, which is not properly handled when creating a ClientHello message. NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT3 due to different affected version ranges. See CVE-2015-8036 for the session ticket issue that was introduced in 1.3.0.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient bounds checking when writing TLS extension data into the output buffer during the creation of a ClientHello message.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to missing length checks when writing extension data (specifically, the session ticket and server name indication (SNI) extensions)",
       "In the Session Ticket extension, the server can send an arbitrarily large ticket to the client, which is then copied to the client's output buffer without checking if it fits"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (client crash) and potentially remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious server can send an overlong session ticket to a client that has session tickets enabled. When the client attempts to resume the session, the ticket is copied into the client's output buffer, causing a heap overflow.",
      "A malicious server can influence a client to use an overly long hostname for the SNI extension, leading to a heap overflow during the construction of the ClientHello message."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a malicious TLS server and communicate with the vulnerable client. For the SNI vector, they would need the ability to influence the hostname that the client connects to. For the session ticket vector, a malicious server needs the client to have session tickets enabled and reuse its context once."
