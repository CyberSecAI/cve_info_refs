Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5970:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

   - The content directly references CVE-2015-5970 and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, which aligns with the CVE description. The content specifically mentions "CVE-2015-5970 ZCM ZENworks ChangePassword XPath Injection Information Disclosure Vulnerability" in the title and explains the root cause. Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2015-5970.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an XPath injection flaw within the `ChangePassword` RPC method of Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM).
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - **XPath Injection:**  The primary weakness is the presence of an XPath injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate the queries used to retrieve data.
     - **System Entity Reference Misuse:** Attackers can combine the XPath injection with a system entity reference, which allows them to access system files.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this to exfiltrate arbitrary text files from the vulnerable system. This could include configuration files, sensitive data, or other system information.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network requests.
     - **RPC Method:** The attack targets the `ChangePassword` RPC method in ZCM.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable ZCM server.
     - **No Authentication Required:**  The content states that authentication is *not* required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning anyone on the network could attempt this attack.

**3. Additional Information**

   - The content mentions that Micro Focus (formerly Novell) has released patches for ZCM versions 11.4.x and 11.3.x. Version 11.4.2 already includes the patch.
   - It credits 'cpnrodzc7' working with HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI-16-167) for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
   - The Zero Day Initiative advisory (ZDI-16-167) provides additional details.
   - The CVSS score is 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), indicating a moderate severity.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM) allows remote unauthenticated attackers to use a combination of XPath injection and system entity references in the `ChangePassword` RPC method to extract arbitrary text files from the server. This information disclosure could be used to further compromise the target system. Patches have been released to mitigate this vulnerability.
