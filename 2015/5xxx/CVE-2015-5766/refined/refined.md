- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path traversal issue existed in asset handling within Air Traffic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  AirTraffic may have allowed access to protected parts of the filesystem.
- **Attack vectors**:  Maliciously crafted assets could trigger the path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need the ability to manipulate assets handled by Air Traffic.
