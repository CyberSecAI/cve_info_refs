- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed in keychain deletion where AppleID credentials may persist in the keychain after sign out.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Failure to properly remove credentials from the keychain upon sign out.
- **Impact of exploitation:** AppleID credentials may persist in the keychain even after the user has signed out, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of the account if the keychain is compromised.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker who gains access to the device's keychain could potentially access the stored credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device and be able to access the keychain data.
