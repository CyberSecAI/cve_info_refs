- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An input validation issue existed when handling NVRAM parameters within the Sandbox component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Input validation vulnerability, allows for potential sandbox escape.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating NVRAM parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
