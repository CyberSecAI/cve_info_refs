{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The kernel-invoked coredump processor provided by ABRT did not handle symbolic links correctly when writing core dumps of ABRT programs to the ABRT dump directory (/var/spool/abrt).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure symlink handling in `abrt-hook-ccpp`. The call to `xopen3()` does not include the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker with write access to an ABRT problem directory could use this flaw to escalate their privileges and gain root access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs write access to an ABRT problem directory."
