2 Bugs ﬁxed since previous Public Release

This document provides a summary of bugﬁxes and changes that have been applied subsequently
to shipping Patch Release #2614.

39798 No security options in Appsuite UI after re-login
When a user ﬁrst logs in, the Guard backend is queried to see if the user has Guard privileges. If so,
then the options are drawn. If an user logged out while writing a new email, and logging in again,
to continue writing this mail, no security options were displayed.
Fixed a race condition to prevent this issue. This is only a partial ﬁx for guard. That needs to be
ﬁxed in frontend for all other default apps expect mail.

39463 OX Guard: uploading private key only possible if original key isn’t deleted
Importing personal key after deleting new created key let to an error. Guard copied data from ex-
isting keys.
Now Guard fetches required data from OX Backend to avoid this.

40003 CVE-2015-5703
CVSSv2: 7.9

3 Tests

The Open-Xchange QA team has successfully veriﬁed all bug ﬁxes that could be reproduced within
a lab environment.

To avoid side eﬀects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server setup for system and integration
testing.

All changes have been checked for potential side-eﬀects and eﬀect on behavior. Unless explicitly

stated within this document, we do not expect any side-eﬀects.
