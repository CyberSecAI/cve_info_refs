  "CVE-2015-5288": {
    "Description": "The crypt() function included with the optional pgCrypto extension could be exploited to read a few additional bytes of memory. No working exploit for this issue has been developed.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The crypt() function in the pgCrypto extension does not properly handle too-short salts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The function could read a few additional bytes of server memory due to improper handling of short salts.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read arbitrary server memory or cause a denial of service through server crashes by providing invalid salts.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with the ability to call the crypt() function with crafted input.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires a user capable of executing SQL queries and calling the crypt() function, with an optional pgcrypto extension. This may also require some privileges, such as a single authentication."
