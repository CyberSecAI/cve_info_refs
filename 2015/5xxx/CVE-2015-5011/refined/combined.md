# PI28139: MQSISTOP/STARTMSGFLOW COMMANDS WITH UNAUTHORIZED USER SUCCEED

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  When using the mqistartmsgflow and mqsistopmsgflow commands to
  start and stop an execution group (EG) with broker
  administration
  security enabled, the user must have execute access on the EG
  specific SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG queue. If this queue does not
  exist, then
  the following BIP2853E and BIP2865E messages will be logged, but
  the execution group will still be started or stopped.

   +BIP2853E (Msg 1/2) MQ10BRK 28 THE BROKER WAS UNABLE TO CHECK
   AUTHORIZATION FOR USER 'CLAPPER ' (SUBCOMPONENT 'EG1'). THE
  REQUEST HAS BEEN REJECTED OWING TO THIS ERROR, EVEN THOUGH THE
  USER MAY IN FACT BE AUTHORIZED.

   +BIP2865E (Msg 2/2) MQ10BRK 28 AUTHORIZATION CHECK FAILED FOR
  USER 'CLAPPER ' SUBCOMPONENT 'EG1' BECAUSE A REQUIRED WEBSPHERE
  MQ QUEUE 'SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG1' WAS NOT FOUND.

  ```

## Local fix

  n/a

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  ****************************************************************
  USERS AFFECTED:
  All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 and IBM Integration
  Bus V9.0 using the mqsistopmsgflow and mqsistartmsgflow commands
  with broker administration security enabled.

  Platforms affected:
  z/OS, MultiPlatform

  ****************************************************************
  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
  When using the mqistartmsgflow and mqsistopmsgflow commands to
  start and stop an execution group (EG) with broker
  administration security enabled, the user must have execute
  access on the EG specific SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH. queue. If this
  queue does not exist, then BIP2853E and BIP2865E messages will
  be logged explaining the failure, however, the execution group
  will still be started or stopped.

  There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
  Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details
  visit
  [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.i
  bm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm)

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The execution group is no longer started/stopped if the user
  fails the authorisation check on the SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH. queue
  when starting/stopping the execution group using the
  mqsistart/stopmsgflow commands.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:

  Version    Maintenance Level
  v8.0       8.0.0.6
  v9.0       9.0.0.4
