Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5011:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** CVE-2015-5011 describes a security vulnerability in IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker where a local user could start and stop a service (execution group) that they should not have access to, even if the authorization check fails.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs because the `mqsistartmsgflow` and `mqsistopmsgflow` commands do not properly enforce authorization checks when broker administration security is enabled. Specifically, if the queue `SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG` (where EG is the execution group name) does not exist, the commands proceed to start or stop the execution group despite the user lacking the necessary permissions.

*   **Weakness:** Improper authorization checks/Missing authorization checks.

*   **Impact:** A local attacker could start or stop execution groups they are not authorized to manage, potentially disrupting services or gaining unauthorized control.

*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the system where IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker is installed and the ability to execute the `mqsistartmsgflow` and `mqsistopmsgflow` commands.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to run the affected commands. They do *not* need to have execute access on the `SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.EG` queue.

*   **Affected Products and Versions:**
    *   IBM Integration Bus V9
    *   WebSphere Message Broker V8

*   **Fix:** The fix ensures that the execution group is not started or stopped if the user fails the authorization check on the `SYSTEM.BROKER.AUTH.` queue when using the `mqsistart/stopmsgflow` commands.  The fix is available in:
    *   IBM Integration Bus V9.0.0.4
    *   WebSphere Message Broker V8.0.0.6
