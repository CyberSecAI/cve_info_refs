Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Koritore, a mobile application built with "applican" for both iOS and Android, handles URL schemes. Specifically, it fails to properly enforce its URL whitelist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Whitelist Bypass:** The application can be launched with a URL scheme that loads an arbitrary page, effectively bypassing the intended URL access restrictions.
- **Improper Permissions Handling (Android):** On Android, if a specific applican API has been granted permission in the Android manifest, the vulnerability allows execution of that API.
- **Arbitrary API Execution (iOS):** On iOS, the vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Page Loading:** Attackers can force the application to load arbitrary web pages, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious content being displayed within the context of the application.
- **API Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary APIs. On Android, this is limited to APIs with granted manifest permissions, whereas on iOS, arbitrary API execution is possible.
- **File Falsification:** The vendor states that a malicious third party could potentially falsify a file that the application has access to.
- **Potential for Data Modification or Loss:** The CVSS metrics suggest a potential for partial confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Schemes:** The vulnerability is triggered by launching the application using a crafted URL scheme. This could be achieved via a link in a website, email, or other communication channels.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable with network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to deliver the malicious URL scheme.
- **Knowledge of URL Schemes:** The attacker must have an understanding of how the application's URL schemes work.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs that bypass the application's whitelist and trigger the desired malicious behavior.

**Additional Notes:**
- The application was developed using "applican", which might indicate a common framework/library vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects versions 1.0 and earlier of both Android and iOS versions of the Koritore app.
- The vulnerability was reported by Kenta Suefusa and Tomonori Shiomi of Sprout Inc.

The provided information aligns with the typical description for a URL whitelist bypass issue in a mobile application, although it is more descriptive than the typical short CVE description.
