This is a great plugin upgrade to the wp-ecommerce plugin. You can fully customize your transaction page, email and generate a pdf invoice. The author is also very involved in customer service. He responded to my issues with a resolution immediately. I highly recommend this plugin to those who are running an e-commerce site and need to make the entire process more professional looking.
