Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `download.php` file of the "wp-ecommerce-shop-styling" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `$_GET['filename']` parameter is directly used in the `readfile()` function without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to manipulate the `filename` parameter, enabling them to download arbitrary files from the server. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Path Traversal:** By using sequences like `../../`, attackers can navigate up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended directory, such as system configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained in the files that the attacker is able to download. This may include system configuration details, database credentials, user information, and other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script.  The `filename` parameter in the URL is used to specify the file to download.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Location:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `download.php` script (e.g., `/wp-content/plugins/wp-ecommerce-shop-styling/includes/download.php`).

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the following PHP code snippet:
    ```php
    <?php
    require_once("../../../../wp-admin/admin.php");
    header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename='.$_GET['filename']);
    header('Content-type: application/pdf');
    readfile(HAET_INVOICE_PATH.$_GET['filename']);
    ?>
    ```
    The critical part is the `readfile(HAET_INVOICE_PATH.$_GET['filename']);` line where the unfiltered `$_GET['filename']` is passed to the function.
*   The provided exploit code is:
    ```
    curl http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-ecommerce-shop-styling/includes/download.php?filename=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
*   The fix implemented in version 2.6 of the plugin includes the following checks:
    ```php
    if( strpos($_GET['filename'], '/') !== FALSE )
        die();
    if( strrpos( strtolower($_GET['filename']), '.pdf') !== strlen($_GET['filename'])-4 )
        die();
    ```
    These checks prevent path traversal by disallowing forward slashes and ensure the requested file ends in `.pdf`.
