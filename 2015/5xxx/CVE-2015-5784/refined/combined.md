# Apple Mac OSX Install.Framework - Arbitrary mkdir / unlink and chown to Admin Group

#### EDB-ID:

###### 38137

#### CVE:

###### [2015-5784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5784)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

---

#### Platform:

###### [OSX](/?platform=osx)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=477

Install.framework has a suid root binary here: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Install.framework/Resources/runner
  This binary vends the IFInstallRunner Distributed Object, which has the following method:

  [IFInstallRunner makeReceiptDirAt:asRoot:]

  If you pass 1 for asRoot, then this code will treat the makeReceiptDirAt string as a path and make two directories
  (Library/Receipts) below it. At first glance this code looks immediately racy and no doubt we could play some
  symlink tricks to get arbitrary directories created, but, on second glance, we can do a lot more!

  This code is using distributed objects which is a "transparent" IPC mechanism: what this means in practise is that
  not only can I call methods on the IFInstallRunner object running in the suid root process, but I can also pass it objects
  from my process; when the suid root process then tries to call methods on those object this will actually result in callbacks
  into my process :)

  In this case rather than just passing an NSString as the makeReceiptDirAt parameter I create and pass an instance of my own class
  "InitialPathObject" which behaves a bit like a string but gives me complete control over its behaviour from my process.

  By creating a couple of this custom classes and implementing various methods we can reach calls to mkdir, chown and unlink with euid == 0.
  We can completely control the string passed to mkdir and unlink.
  In the chown case the code will chown our controlled path to root:admin; regular os x users are members of the admin group which means that this
  will give the user access to files which previously belonged to a different group.

  To hit the three actions (mkdir, chown and unlink) with controlled arguments we need to override various
  combinations of selectors and fail at the right points:

  InitialPathObject = the object we pass to the makeReceiptDirAt selector
    overrides: - stringByAppendingPathComponent
                 * will be called twice:
                    * first time:  return an NSString* pointing to a non-existant file
                    * second time: return SecondFakeStringObject

  SecondFakeStringObject = returned by the second call to stringByAppendingPathComponent
    overrides: - length
                 * will be called by the NSFileManager?
                 * return length of path to non-existant file
               - getCharacters:
                 * will be called by the NSFileManager?
                 * return character of the non-existant file path
               - fileSystemRepresentation
                 * for MKDIR:
                   * first time: return char* of the target path
                   * second time: return char* to non-existant file
                   * third time: return char* to non-existant file
                 * for CHOWN:
                   * first time: return char* of temporary directory to create and ignore
                   * second time: return char* of target path
                 * for UNLINK:
                   * first time: return char* of temporary directory to create and ignore
                   * second time: return char* to non-existant file
                   * third time: return char* to path to unlink
               - stringByAppendingPathComponent:
                 * for MKDIR:
                   * not called
                 * for CHOWN:
                   * return NSString* pointing to file which does exist // to bail out before creating /Receipts
                 * for UNLINK
                   * not called

  build: clang -o as_root_okay_then_poc as_root_okay_then_poc.m -framework Foundation
  run: ./as_root_okay_then_poc MKDIR|CHOWN|UNLINK <target>

  note that this will create some root-owned temporary directories in /tmp which will need to be manually cleaned up

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
