  "cve": "CVE-2015-5784",
  "description": "An issue existed in how Install.framework's 'runner' binary dropped privileges. This issue was addressed through improved privilege management.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Install.framework's 'runner' binary, which runs as suid root, has a vulnerability in the `makeReceiptDirAt:asRoot:` method of the IFInstallRunner Distributed Object. This method, when called with `asRoot = 1`, creates two directories (Library/Receipts) below the provided path. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `makeReceiptDirAt` parameter can be controlled by the attacker via custom objects that perform callbacks into the attacker's process during path manipulation, allowing for arbitrary mkdir, chown and unlink operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege dropping in the suid root binary.",
      "Unsafe use of Distributed Objects to pass attacker-controlled objects to the suid process.",
      "Lack of proper input validation when using the object's methods, allowing attacker to control the path passed to file system functions."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious application can execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This includes actions like creating arbitrary directories (`mkdir`), changing ownership (`chown`) to the admin group (allowing access to files that previously belonged to a different group), and deleting files (`unlink`).",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the vulnerable `makeReceiptDirAt:asRoot:` method of the IFInstallRunner Distributed Object with a custom crafted object.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the vulnerable system and craft a malicious object to be passed to the vulnerable function."
