Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when the "Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi" application displays strings, specifically SSIDs, which contain malicious scripts. The application does not sanitize or properly handle these malformed strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Script Injection:** The application is vulnerable to script injection because it does not validate or sanitize the SSID strings it processes before displaying them. This lack of validation allows for the execution of malicious scripts embedded within the SSID.
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** This vulnerability is explicitly identified as a case of Improper Input Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   If a device running the vulnerable application connects to a Wi-Fi access point with a malicious SSID, the embedded script can be executed. The impact is categorized as partial for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network range (i.e., within the Wi-Fi signal range) to present a malicious SSID.
*   **SSID Manipulation:** The attack vector relies on the ability of an attacker to control or set up a Wi-Fi access point with a manipulated SSID string containing malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be within the network range of a device running the vulnerable "Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi" application.
*   The attacker needs to have the capability to set up or control a Wi-Fi access point with a maliciously crafted SSID.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
