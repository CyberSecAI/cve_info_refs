Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double-free condition within the `jasper_image_stop_load` function in the JasPer JPEG-2000 library. This is triggered due to a previous integer overflow in the `jas_image_cmpt_create` function which results in invalid memory allocation and a subsequent attempt to free already freed memory. The integer overflow is caused due to a multiplication of `cmpt->width_`, `cmpt->height_` and `cmpt->cps_` which can overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free, where a memory region is freed twice, which leads to memory corruption.
*   **Integer Overflow:** A prior integer overflow is a contributing factor where a variable calculation can cause a wrap around and lead to an unexpected result.
*   **Use-After-Free:** The double free is triggered as a consequence of a use-after-free condition where the memory pointed to by `tvp` and `tvp->buf` is accessed after being freed

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause the application using the JasPer library to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution due to the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted JPEG 2000 image. This can be achieved by enticing a user to open a malicious image file or by an automated service parsing a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted JPEG 2000 image to a vulnerable application using the JasPer library.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker is remote.

**Additional details from analyzed content:**
*   The vulnerability is located in `src/libjasper/mif/mif_cod.c` and `src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c`.
*   The double free occurs when the `jas_tvparser_destroy(tvp)` function is called twice, due to incorrect branch conditions. The `tvp` variable has already been freed, but the code performs a check on a member `tvp->buf` which was also freed leading to the use-after-free condition
*   The integer overflow occurs because the `jas_stream_memopen()` function receives a negative bufsize value after type conversion from size_t which is later used in `mem_resize()` with integer type.
