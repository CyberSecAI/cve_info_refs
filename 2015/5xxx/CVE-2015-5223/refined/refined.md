All other content is either navigational or refers to other CVEs.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) TempURLs.
   - When a user has a PUT tempurl key, it can be misused to gain read access to other objects within the same tenant (account).
   - Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by a combination of PUT tempurls and Distributed Large Object (DLO) manifest creation. An attacker can create a DLO manifest that references objects in a different container and then use the PUT tempurl and associated GET tempurl to read data in that other container.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Information Leak:** Possession of a PUT-authorized tempurl key allows unauthorized access to object data in other containers within the same tenant.
   - **Bypassing Access Control:** The vulnerability enables bypassing the intended container-level access restrictions associated with tempurls, which are supposed to provide temporary access to specific objects in a specific container.
   - **DLO Manifest Manipulation:**  The ability to create a DLO manifest that points to objects in other containers is a critical weakness that allows attackers to probe for and access objects outside the scope of their permissions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data in other containers by exploiting this vulnerability.
   - **Data Exposure:** The attacker can obtain contents of other containers via crafted DLO manifests and PUT/GET tempurls.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network using HTTP requests.
   - **TempURLs:** The attack vector involves the misuse of PUT tempurls, which are a feature of OpenStack Swift.
   - **Large Objects (DLO):** Exploits creation of DLO manifests to point to data in other containers.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated OpenStack user in order to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **PUT Tempurl Key:**  The attacker needs to have a valid PUT tempurl key (which is usually meant for uploading data).
   - **Knowledge of Object Names:** The attacker typically also needs to have some knowledge about the object names to exploit this, or probe for those.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Scope of Affected Versions:** OpenStack Swift versions up to 2.3.0 are vulnerable.
*  **Fix:** A patch is implemented to address this vulnerability by preventing PUT tempurls from creating DLO manifests. This will return 400 error if the X-Object-Manifest header is provided in a PUT request via tempurl. It is also important to check the scope of container tempurls so they don't allow access to other containers.
*   **Mitigation (Partial):** The vulnerability is mitigated by restricting tempurls to the container from which the key was derived. This ensures that the tempurls can only be used to access data from the same container and not other containers.

**Summary of Relevant Information:**
CVE-2015-5223 is an information leak vulnerability in OpenStack Swift where PUT tempurls, when combined with DLO manifests, can be exploited to access sensitive information in other containers within the same tenant (account). Attackers must have a valid PUT tempurl key and some level of understanding of the targeted account/containers. The fixes implemented block tempurls from creating DLO manifests and enforces proper container scoping, preventing cross-container data access using this vector.
