Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5285:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `came_from` parameter within the Kallithea login functionality. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate this input before using it as an HTTP header value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTTP Header Injection (Response Splitting):** The core vulnerability is an HTTP header injection, also known as response splitting. By injecting newline characters (`\r\n`) into the `came_from` parameter, an attacker can insert arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Control Over HTTP Response:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to control the HTTP headers and body of the response sent by the server. This includes the ability to create additional responses entirely under the attacker's control.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The injected headers could potentially redirect users or introduce XSS by injecting malicious JavaScript code, leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is manipulating the `came_from` parameter in the GET request to the `/login` endpoint.
-  The attacker sends a crafted URL with newline characters to inject malicious headers, redirecting the user to the attacker controlled domain.
    - Example: `/login?came_from=d47b5%0d%0aX-Forwarded-Host%3a%20http://zeroscience.mk%01%02%0d%0aLocation%3a%20http://zeroscience.mk`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kallithea instance.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and responses and how to inject headers.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
- Affected versions include Kallithea 0.2.9 and 0.2.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Kallithea version 0.3 by validating the `came_from` parameter against RFC 3986. The fix replaces `urlparse` with a regular expression validation.
