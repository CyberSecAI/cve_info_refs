Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability in the Floating Social Bar plugin for WordPress:

**CVE-2015-5528:** This CVE ID is not mentioned in the provided content. However, the changelog of the plugin describes a vulnerability that may be related:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The changelog indicates "Fixed potential XSS vulnerability with saving the order of social services" in version 1.1.7 and "Fixed possible security issue with saving order of items in FSB" in version 1.1.6. This suggests that the plugin was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization or encoding when saving the order of social media icons. It is likely that unsanitized input was stored and outputted on the admin settings page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. The plugin didn't properly handle user-supplied input, specifically when saving the order of social media icons. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the settings page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin did not adequately sanitize or encode the data when saving the order of social services, which is a classic vulnerability for XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   This malicious code would then execute in the browsers of administrators who access the plugin's settings page.
*   This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing admin session cookies.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining unauthorized access to the WordPress site and its administrative functions.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the site.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing or stealing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Panel:** The attack vector is the plugin settings page within the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Input Manipulation:** An attacker would need to manipulate the order of social services in such a way that the unsanitized input is stored in the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Admin Access:** The attacker would need some level of access to the WordPress admin panel. At minimum, they would likely need to be an administrator or have the capability to modify plugin settings.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker would need some understanding of how XSS attacks work to craft the malicious input.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The changelog entries are brief and do not provide specific technical details of the vulnerability, but they clearly indicate a security flaw related to saving social media service order.
*   The review mentioning "Messed Up My Facebook Posts" may be related to another bug in the plugin, not XSS, where it would overwrite the text on the shared content with the dimensions of the social media bar.
*  The plugin is quite old and has not been updated in 7 years, making it potentially risky to use and more vulnerable to exploitation.

**Summary:** The Floating Social Bar plugin had an XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization when saving social media service orders. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the admin settings page and potentially take control of the WordPress site.
