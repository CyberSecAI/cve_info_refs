This allows local users to create symlinks and files at arbitrary locations as the abrt user by exploiting predictable temporary directory names. The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a directory in /var/tmp, then tricking abrt into extracting malicious cpio archives. This issue has been addressed in RHSA-2015:2505. Oracle Linux is also affected."
