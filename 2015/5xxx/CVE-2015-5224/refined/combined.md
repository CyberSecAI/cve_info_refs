Message-ID: <20150824130910.GA7139@localhost.localdomain>
Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2015 06:09:10 -0700
From: Qualys Security Advisory <qsa@...lys.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2015-5224 login-utils: file name collision due to incorrect
 mkstemp use

Dear List,

A CVE-ID and a patch have just been issued for a vulnerability that we
discovered in util-linux (while investigating the libuser bugs):

CVE-2015-5224 login-utils: file name collision due to incorrect mkstemp use
<https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/bde91c85bdc77975155058276f99d2e0f5eab5a9>

If the chfn and chsh binaries (both setuid-root) from
util-linux/login-utils are compiled WITHOUT libuser support, they
eventually call mkostemp(localtmp, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_CLOEXEC);
where localtmp is "/etc/%s.XXXXXX" and %s is __progname (i.e., argv[0]'s
basename).

An attacker could repeatedly execve chfn as "ld.so" until mkostemp()
creates "/etc/ld.so.preload" (after a few days, in our tests).  This
particular example doesn't actually work, because "preload" is 7 chars
and "XXXXXX" is 6 chars, but it seems there are other interesting
possibilities, like "/etc/rc.status" and "/etc/krb5.keytab".

The impact of this vulnerability is probably very limited: most Linux
distributions ship either the chfn/chsh binaries from the shadow-utils
(NOT the login-utils ones), or the login-utils ones but WITH libuser
support.

With best regards,

--
the Qualys Security Advisory team

chsh, chfn, vipw: fix filenames collision

```
The utils when compiled WITHOUT libuser then mkostemp()ing
"/etc/%s.XXXXXX" where the filename prefix is argv[0] basename.

An attacker could repeatedly execute the util with modified argv[0]
and after many many attempts mkostemp() may generate suffix which
makes sense. The result maybe temporary file with name like rc.status
ld.so.preload or krb5.keytab, etc.

Note that distros usually use libuser based ch{sh,fn} or stuff from
shadow-utils.

It's probably very minor security bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1256686#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-25 09:27:24 UTC  ``` The following vulnerability in util-linux was announced (taken from <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/423>):  """ If the chfn and chsh binaries (both setuid-root) from util-linux/login-utils are compiled WITHOUT libuser support, they eventually call mkostemp(localtmp, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_CLOEXEC); where localtmp is "/etc/%s.XXXXXX" and %s is __progname (i.e., argv[0]'s basename).  An attacker could repeatedly execve chfn as "ld.so" until mkostemp() creates "/etc/ld.so.preload" (after a few days, in our tests).  This particular example doesn't actually work, because "preload" is 7 chars and "XXXXXX" is 6 chars, but it seems there are other interesting possibilities, like "/etc/rc.status" and "/etc/krb5.keytab".  The impact of this vulnerability is probably very limited: most Linux distributions ship either the chfn/chsh binaries from the shadow-utils (NOT the login-utils ones), or the login-utils ones but WITH libuser support. """  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/bde91c85bdc77975155058276f99d2e0f5eab5a9>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1256686#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-25 12:02:39 UTC  ```  Created util-linux tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1256751](show_bug.cgi?id=1256751 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2015-5224 util-linux: File name collision due to incorrect mkstemp use [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1256686#c2)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-09-02 12:03:36 UTC  ``` We're not affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
