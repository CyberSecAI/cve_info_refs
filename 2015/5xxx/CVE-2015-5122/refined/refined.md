Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-5122:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `DisplayObject` class within the ActionScript 3 (AS3) implementation of Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the `opaqueBackground` property of the `DisplayObject` class, allowing access to memory that has already been freed. This allows for attacker-controlled memory corruption
*   The vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player versions 9.0 through 18.0.0.204.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system, gaining control of the affected machine.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause a denial of service through memory corruption.
*   Attackers can also use this vulnerability to bypass sandbox defenses (e.g. Chrome, Adobe Reader)

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Flash Content:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating specially crafted Flash content.
*   **Websites:** Enticing users to visit a website hosting malicious Flash content.
*   **Office Documents:** Delivering malicious Flash content via specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents that embed Flash files or leverage Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to download external flash content..
*   **Email Attachments:** Opening attachments containing crafted SWF (Flash) files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without requiring any authentication.
*   **Ability to Craft Flash Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate Flash content to trigger the use-after-free condition.
*   The exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Hacking Team and made public as part of a data leak.
*   Affected systems include Windows XP SP3, Vista SP2, 7 SP1, 8.1 and 10 with various browser versions and Flash versions up to 18.0.0.204.

The provided documents also highlight the importance of applying patches, disabling Flash in browsers or using click-to-play, and utilizing tools like Microsoft's EMET to mitigate the risk.
