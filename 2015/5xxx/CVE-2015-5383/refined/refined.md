Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of access control on the `logs`, `config`, and `temp` directories within the Roundcube webmail application. Specifically, these directories were accessible via the web server, allowing unauthorized users to potentially view sensitive information contained within them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information. In one specific example, a log entry contained a database error that included session IDs and other data that could be used to impersonate a user.
*   **Lack of Access Control:**  The absence of `.htaccess` files or other mechanisms to prevent direct web access to these directories is the core weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker who gains access to the log files could potentially extract session IDs to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration:** Access to the `config` directory could potentially expose sensitive configuration details.
*   **General Information Leakage:** The log files could reveal internal system or application details that would be useful to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Web Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the unprotected directories through the webserver (e.g., `webroot/logs/errors`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Roundcube installation via a web browser.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability, as they are accessing the directories directly, not through the application interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix implemented in the commit (012555c) added `.htaccess` files to the `config`, `logs`, and `temp` directories, which deny web server access to these directories. This prevents unauthorized direct access.
*   The commit also updated the `INSTALL` instructions to emphasize securing these directories.
*   The issue was reported due to a log entry revealing sensitive data like a session ID.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Roundcube versions 1.1.2 and later, however, it was not deemed to affect version 1.0.
