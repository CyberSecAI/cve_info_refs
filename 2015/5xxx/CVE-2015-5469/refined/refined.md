Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `mdc-youtube-downloader` WordPress plugin (specifically version 2.1.0) had a vulnerability in its `includes/download.php` file.
*   The plugin used user-supplied input from the `$_GET['file']` parameter without proper sanitization or validation to construct a file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of access control and path validation for the `$file_name` variable. This allowed an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server's local file system.
*  **Path Traversal**: By supplying a path like `/etc/passwd`, an attacker could potentially access and download sensitive files located outside of the intended plugin directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could download sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, and other confidential data. This could lead to further compromise of the system.
*   **System compromise**: If configuration files are downloaded, they may contain sensitive information that would enable further system compromise.
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability was triggered through a simple HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `download.php` script.
*   **`file` Parameter:** The attacker manipulated the `file` parameter within the GET request to specify the path of the file they wanted to download.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only required network access to the vulnerable WordPress site. No authentication or special privileges were needed.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needed to know the location of the `download.php` file within the plugin directory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Larry W. Cashdollar.
*   The vendor, Nazmul Ahsan, was notified on 2015-07-01 and addressed the issue in version 2.1.1 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code was removed in changeset [1191915](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1191915).
* The fix for the vulnerability involved the removal of the vulnerable `download.php` file.
