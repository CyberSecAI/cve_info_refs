Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5483

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress "Private Only" plugin version 3.5.1 fails to implement proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention techniques. Specifically, it does not use WordPress nonces for CSRF protection and lacks output escaping (using `esc_attr()`) for user-controlled data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, will execute actions on their behalf.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  The lack of output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which is then rendered in the admin interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
*   Store malicious content in the database.
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser.
*   Perform administrative actions such as adding users, deleting posts, and potentially even modifying PHP files (if that functionality is enabled). This can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website with malicious code.
*   **XSS:** The malicious code injected through CSRF will be stored in database and executed on subsequent page loads for admin users, or immediately if the browser doesn't have reflected XSS protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in WordPress administrator user to unknowingly trigger the CSRF attack.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to craft the malicious payload to exploit both CSRF and XSS.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided proof of concept shows how to inject JavaScript into the `po_logo` field.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on March 20, 2015 and reported to the vendor on July 9, 2015.
*   The vendor did not respond to the report, and the plugin was eventually removed from the WordPress plugins directory on August 24, 2015.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.8 (Medium).
