Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an improper application of whitelist restrictions in Apache Cordova for Android applications using remote servers. Specifically, the whitelist mechanism fails to block network redirects from a whitelisted remote website to a non-whitelisted website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate enforcement of whitelist restrictions.
- The vulnerability exists when using the `http` and `https` protocols.
- The whitelist does not prevent network redirects from trusted to untrusted sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can potentially bypass whitelist restrictions by redirecting from a whitelisted site to a malicious one.
-  This could potentially allow the attacker to load malicious content or execute malicious scripts within the context of the Cordova application, due to the application navigating to an unauthorized URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that initiates a redirect to a non-whitelisted site, from a whitelisted site.
-  This is a network-based attack, requiring the application to interact with a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control or compromise a whitelisted website, allowing the attacker to inject malicious redirects.
- The attacker needs no authentication to perform the attack, just to have a whitelisted server controlled, and then trigger redirects to the non-whitelisted server.
- The attacker can be remote as this is a network based attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The severity of this vulnerability was initially assessed as medium but was later downgraded to low after further investigation, because its impact is limited by the fact that attacker needs to have control on the whitelisted site.
- The suggested mitigation is to ensure that only trusted websites are whitelisted and to make sure that whitelisted websites don't redirect to malicious sites.
- Developers should also use SSL and Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate this issue.
-  Upgrading to the latest version of Cordova Android is highly recommended.
