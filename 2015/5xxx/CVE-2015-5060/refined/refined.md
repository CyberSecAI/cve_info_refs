The provided content is related to CVE-2015-5060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in Anchor CMS. The search functionality does not properly sanitize user-supplied input from the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS. The application takes the search term from the URL and uses it in a way that allows JavaScript to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload in the search parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and lure a user to visit it. No special privileges or access to the server are needed.
