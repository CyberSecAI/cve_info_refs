## Description

[![@a0xnirudh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5573458?u=5fef0cfe81478b7b5adcf1d9574b2d727201b061&v=4&size=48)](/a0xnirudh)[a0xnirudh](https://github.com/a0xnirudh)opened [on Jun 24, 2015](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms/issues/875#issue-90741467)

Hello all,

The search option of the anchor CMS is properly escaped but an attacker can directly inject an XSS payload on the URL and it will execute properly. This happens in the most recent version of anchor CMS available to download from the [official site](http://anchorcms.com/) i.e.version 0.9.2.

The simple payload looks like this:

[http://localhost/anchor/index.php/search/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E](http://localhost/anchor/index.php/search/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C/script%3E)
