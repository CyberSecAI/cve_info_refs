Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5076:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of the X2Engine web application to properly sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it in the subsequent HTTP response. This occurs in multiple locations of the application's code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present due to the application's failure to restrict the type of data accepted and to sanitize it before rendering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application's response, leading to potential consequences, such as:

*   Session hijacking by stealing cookies
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Malicious actions performed in the context of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in the GET parameters or POST parameters. The attacker crafts a malicious link and tricks the victim into clicking the link to execute the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim into accessing it while logged into the vulnerable application. No special privileges or direct access to the server are required. The attacker can be external and does not need prior authentication for certain injection points.
