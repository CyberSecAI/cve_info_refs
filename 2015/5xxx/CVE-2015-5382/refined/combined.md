Use CVE-2015-5382. For 1.1, the security fix for _alt seems to be
announced in <http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/e84fafcec/github> --
do you mean that part of the _alt vulnerability was fixed in
<http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/681ba6fc3/github> and then a
different part of the _alt vulnerability was fixed in
<http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/e84fafcec/github> (if so, then
there would potentially be another CVE ID)?

Use CVE-2015-5383. Note that
<http://trac.roundcube.net/browser/github/INSTALL> states:

  REQUIREMENTS
  * .htaccess support allowing overrides for DirectoryIndex

Thus, we wouldn't want to have a separate CVE ID for a scenario in
which someone attempts to use Roundcube with nginx.

Mistake on my side. 681ba6fc3 was a changeset that removed functionality
using the _alt argument, I did not mean to imply that part of the _alt
vulnerability was fixed by it.
e84fafcec is the changeset that fixes the issue in 1.1, and 6ccd4c54b
the corresponding backport to 1.0.

## Description

[![@rcubetrac](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17438468?u=5b98ad5b5c260bccd9885d58020feb38a8d7efc1&v=4&size=48)](/rcubetrac)[rcubetrac](https://github.com/rcubetrac)opened [on May 6, 2015](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/4817#issue-142211891)

*Reported by nrogers on 6 May 2015 16:37 UTC as Trac ticket #1490379*

There is a potential for an arbitrary read from an authenticated user who uploads a contact (vCard) with a specially crafted POST. Though I couldn't get the bug to trigger myself, this code still looks dangerous:

\program\steps\addressbook\photo.inc @ line 67-96

If the $data value can be set to NULL (through vCard) and the \_alt parameter is a valid file on the server an arbitrary read could occur:

if (!$data && ($alt\_img = rcube\_utils::get\_input\_value('\_alt', rcube\_utils::INPUT\_GPC)) && is\_file($alt\_img)) {

$data = file\_get\_contents($alt\_img);

}

This is returned via echo() a few lines down:

if ($data) {

header('Content-Type: ' . rcube\_mime::image\_content\_type($data));

echo $data;

}

Though I was unable to find a way to have data=NULL the concerning part is the \_alt field. There doesn't seem to be a corresponding feature for this in the GUI. Might be wise to remove if the functionality isn't used.

Attached is an example POST command to trigger this *potential* bug by supplying the "\_alt" param in the POST. User must be authenticated

# Updates 1.1.2 and 1.0.6 released

Published: 05 June 2015

* Tags:
* [releases](/news/releases)
* [updates](/news/updates)

We just published updates to both stable versions 1.0 and 1.1
after fixing many minor bugs and adding some security improvements
to the 1.1 release branch. Version 1.0.6 comes with cherry-picked
fixes from the more recent version to ensure proper long term support
especially in regards of security and compatibility.

The security-related fixes in particular are:

* XSS vulnerability in \_mbox argument
* security improvement in contact photo handling
* potential info disclosure from temp directory

See the full changelog [here](http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Changelog).

Both versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all
productive installations of Roundcube with either of these versions.
Download them from [roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download).

As usual, don’t forget to backup your data before updating!

*And there’s one more thing:* please support our crowdfunding campaign
for [Roundcube Next](https://roundcu.be/next) either directly or by
spreading the word about it. Your help is much appreciated!
