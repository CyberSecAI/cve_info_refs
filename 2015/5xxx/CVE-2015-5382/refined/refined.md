Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `_alt` parameter in the `photo.inc` file within the Roundcube address book component. This parameter was intended to specify an alternate image, but it could be manipulated to read arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `_alt` parameter. Specifically, if `$data` is null and `_alt` points to a valid file path, the `file_get_contents()` function reads the file's content, which is then sent in the response.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The code does not properly restrict which files are allowed to be read using the `_alt` parameter.
- **Unintended Functionality:** The `_alt` parameter is not a documented feature in the GUI, indicating it might be legacy or debug functionality, but is still accessible and vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (e.g., `config.inc.php`), potentially leading to further compromise, such as database credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  The contents of readable files could be exposed, impacting the confidentiality of the system and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited using an HTTP GET request to the `photo.inc` script, where the `_alt` parameter is provided with the path to the target file.
- **Crafted vCard Upload:** While the initial report mentions crafted vCard uploads, the core issue resides in the `_alt` parameter of the photo.inc script. The vCard is used to trigger the path that would be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be an authenticated user of the Roundcube webmail application, because the photo.inc endpoint is called as part of the addressbook handling.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the file paths of interest on the server's filesystem, but no prior knowledge of the system or network is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves removing the vulnerable code that handles the `_alt` parameter, preventing arbitrary file reads.
- The vulnerability is present in Roundcube versions 1.0 and 1.1. The fix is included in Roundcube 1.1.2 and 1.0.6 releases.
- The initial report mentioned the `$data` variable having to be null, but the core vulnerability exists in the direct reading of the `_alt` parameter with file\_get\_contents(), so the condition is not necessary for exploitation.
