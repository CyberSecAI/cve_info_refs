| applican vulnerable to URL whitelist bypass | |
| Overview | |
| applican provided by Newphoria Corporation Inc. is a platform to build hybrid applications for both iOS and Android. applican provides a whitelisting function (whitelist.xml) to limit the URLs that applications can access. However, if the application is launched using the URL-scheme, the access restriction is bypassed and URLs that are not whitelisted can be accessed. If an API of applican framework is specified in the URL, the API will be called in the context of the URL. | |

# JVN#73346595 applican vulnerable to URL whitelist bypass

## Overview

applican provided by Newphoria Corporation Inc. allows applications to access URLs that are not approved in the whitelist.

## Products Affected

* Applications built using applican for Android versions 1.12.2 and earlier
* Applications built using applican for iOS versions 1.12.2 and earlier

[Added on October 14, 2015]

Note that applican for iOS ver. 1.12.2 did not address the vulnerability completely. Newer versions have been released.

## Description

applican provided by Newphoria Corporation Inc. is a platform to build hybrid applications for both iOS and Android. applican provides a whitelisting function (whitelist.xml) to limit the URLs that applications can access. However, if the application is launched using the URL-scheme, the access restriction is bypassed and URLs that are not whitelisted can be accessed. If an API of applican framework is specified in the URL, the API will be called in the context of the URL.

## Impact

Android apps built using applican may allow an applican API to be executed if that API has been granted permission in the android manifest.

iOS apps built using applican may allow an arbitrary API to be executed.

## Solution

**Update applican and rebuild the application**

Update to the latest version of applican and rebuild the application according to the information provided by the developer.

**Analyzed on 2015.09.16 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:6.8
