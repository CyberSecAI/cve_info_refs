Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly enforce URL whitelisting in the 'applican' framework when applications are launched using a URL-scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **URL Whitelist Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the configured URL whitelist (whitelist.xml) when an application built with 'applican' is launched using a URL-scheme. This allows access to URLs that should be restricted.
- **Unrestricted API Access (iOS):** On iOS, it is possible to execute optional APIs used by the iOS application via the URL-scheme bypass.
- **Unrestricted API access (Android):** On Android, it is possible to call any API's on behalf of the affected application that have the required permissions in the Android manifest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Android:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized execution of applican APIs with permissions granted in the Android manifest.
- **iOS:** Exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary APIs within the iOS application's context. This could potentially expose sensitive information or manipulate application behavior.
- Both OS's: It is possible to access URLs that should have been restricted, potentially allowing for the retrieval or manipulation of data from those locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL-Scheme Launch:** The attack vector involves launching the vulnerable application using a specially crafted URL-scheme. The attacker can embed a URL containing a non-whitelisted endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable application's URL-scheme. This can be achieved through a link, a QR code, or other means that can cause the operating system to launch an application via a URL.
- **Knowledge of Target API:** An attacker needs to know about the applican API that they want to call. On iOS this is any optional API used by the application, and on Android this needs to have corresponding permission in the Android manifest.
