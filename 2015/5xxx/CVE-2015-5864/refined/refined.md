Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5864:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** An issue existed in the IOAudioFamily that led to the disclosure of kernel memory content.
*   **Weakness:** Kernel memory disclosure.
*   **Impact:** A local user may be able to determine kernel memory layout.
*   **Attack vector:**  A local attacker with the ability to interact with the vulnerable system and potentially trigger the audio subsystem functionality.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the target system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is described as an issue in `IOAudioFamily` that "led to the disclosure of kernel memory content." The fix was to address this vulnerability by "permuting kernel pointers." This suggests that the vulnerability involved leaking pointers to kernel memory, which could have been used by an attacker to gain knowledge of the kernel's internal layout and potentially aid in further exploitation attempts.
