Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2015-5314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the handling of fragmented EAP-pwd (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Password) messages within both `hostapd` (access point daemon) and `wpa_supplicant` (WPA supplicant).
*   Specifically, when an EAP-pwd message is fragmented, the code fails to properly validate the remaining reassembly buffer length for the *last* fragment. While the code does check the length of the initial fragments, the lack of validation for the last fragment allows a malicious actor to craft a final fragment that attempts to write past the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the length of the last fragment in a fragmented EAP-pwd message. This is a classic input validation vulnerability that allows an attacker to supply crafted data that leads to unexpected behavior.
*   **Missing Length Check:**  The code does not verify if the last fragment of the reassembled message attempts to exceed the remaining reassembly buffer length, while such check is performed for the preceding fragments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although a buffer overflow is prevented due to a separate validation within `wpabuf_put_data()`, the attempt to write beyond the buffer leads to process termination. This results in a denial-of-service condition, where `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant` will crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Over-the-Air:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker within radio range of the vulnerable device. This implies it can be exploited remotely over the wireless network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the radio range of a vulnerable access point (when targeting `hostapd`) or a client (when targeting `wpa_supplicant`).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the targeted host.
*   **Knowledge of EAP-pwd:** The attacker needs to craft an EAP-pwd message with a malicious final fragment to exploit the vulnerability.

**Specifics for Hostapd and wpa\_supplicant**

*   **hostapd:**  Vulnerable when used with an internal EAP server or as a RADIUS server with EAP-pwd enabled. Exploitation can lead to denial-of-service of the access point.
*   **wpa\_supplicant:** Vulnerable when EAP-pwd is enabled in a network configuration profile. Exploitation can lead to denial-of-service of the client device.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability is present in `hostapd` versions 2.0 through 2.5, and `wpa_supplicant` versions 2.0 through 2.5.
*  The vulnerability requires that `CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y` is set in the build configuration and EAP-pwd is enabled at runtime.
