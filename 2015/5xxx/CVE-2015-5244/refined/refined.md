Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `mod_nss` parses cipher strings provided via the `NSSCipherSuite` option. Specifically, when using the "!" syntax to disable insecure ciphersuites (e.g., `!eNULL:!aNULL`), the parsing logic incorrectly interpreted this as an instruction to enable those ciphersuites, instead of disabling them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Cipher String Parsing:** The core issue is the flawed logic that handles cipher strings with the negation operator (!), leading to unintended enabling of insecure ciphers.
*   **Use of `-1` Value**: The code used `-1`, `0`, and `1` to represent disabled, disabled, and enabled ciphers respectively. Passing `-1` to the `SSL_CipherPrefSet()` function resulted in enabling the cipher instead of disabling it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure to Insecure Ciphers:** By misinterpreting the "!" syntax, the server would enable insecure ciphersuites (like eNULL and aNULL), which could make the server vulnerable to various man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communications. An attacker could potentially downgrade the connection to use these weak ciphers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Configuration-Based:** The vulnerability is exploited by configuring the `NSSCipherSuite` option in the `mod_nss` configuration file using the "!" syntax to explicitly exclude insecure ciphers. This would inadvertently enable them due to the parsing error.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Once the vulnerable configuration is in place, an attacker positioned in the network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by forcing the connection to use the now-enabled weak ciphers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Configuration Knowledge:** The attacker would not need any special permissions. The attacker would need knowledge that the server is using `mod_nss` and its configuration.
*   **Network Position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic to leverage the enabled weak ciphers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The bug was discovered by Hubert Kario of Red Hat.
* The issue was fixed upstream with the commit: `34e1ccecb4a7d5054dba2f92b403af9b6ae1e110`.
* The fix involved correctly passing `PR_TRUE` or `PR_FALSE` based on whether the cipher was enabled or disabled to `SSL_CipherPrefSet()`.
