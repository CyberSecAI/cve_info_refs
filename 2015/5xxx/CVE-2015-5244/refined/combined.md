| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1259216#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-09-02 08:37:32 UTC  ``` The NSSCipherSuite option of mod_nss accepts OpenSSL-styled cipherstrings. It was found that the parsing of such cipherstrings is flawed. If this option is used to disable insecure ciphersuites using the common "!" syntax, e.g.:  NSSCipherSuite !eNULL:!aNULL:AESGCM+aRSA:ECDH+aRSA  it will actually enable those insecure ciphersuites.

# Pagure

| Author: | Pierre-Yves Chibon <pingou@pingoured.fr> |
| --- | --- |

Pagure is a git-centered forge, python based using pygit2.

With pagure you can host your project with its documentation, let your users
report issues or request enhancements using the ticketing system and build your
community of contributors by allowing them to fork your projects and contribute
to it via the now-popular pull-request mechanism.

Homepage: <https://pagure.io/pagure>

See it at work: <https://pagure.io>

Playground version: <https://stg.pagure.io>

If you have any questions or just would like to discuss about pagure,
feel free to drop by [our Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#pagure:fedora.im).

# About its name

The name Pagure is taken from the French word 'pagure'. Pagure in French is used as the
common name for the crustaceans from the [Paguroidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_crab)
superfamily, which is basically the family of the Hermit crabs.

Originating from French it is pronounced with a strong 'g' as you can hear
on [this recording](https://pagure.io/how-do-you-pronounce-pagure/raw/master/f/pingou.ogg).

# Get it running

There are several options when it comes to a development environment.
They are: Docker Compose, Vagrant, and manual. Choose an option below.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose will provide you with a container which you can develop on.
Install it [with these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

For more information about docker-compose cli, see: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/>.

To build and run the containers, use the following command:

> ```
> ./dev/docker-start.sh
>
> ```

Once all the containers have started, you can access pagure on <http://localhost:5000>.
To stop the containers, press `Ctrl+C`.

Once the containers are up and running, run this command to populate the
container with test data and create a new account:

> ```
> docker-compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml exec web python3 dev-data.py --all
>
> ```

You can then log in with any of the created users, by example:

* username: pingou
* password: testing123

## Vagrant

For a more thorough introduction to Vagrant, see
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Vagrant>.

An example Vagrantfile is provided as `Vagrantfile.example`. To use it,
just copy it and install Vagrant. Instructions for Fedora:

> ```
> cp dev/Vagrantfile.example Vagrantfile
> sudo dnf install ansible libvirt vagrant-libvirt vagrant-sshfs vagrant-hostmanager
> vagrant up
>
> ```

On Ubuntu, install Vagrant directly [from the website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
then run these commands instead:

> ```
> cp dev/Vagrantfile.example Vagrantfile
> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install ansible libvirt0 openssh-server qemu libvirt-bin ebtables dnsmasq libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
> vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt vagrant-sshfs vagrant-hostmanager
>
> ```

If you get this error `Block in synced_folders: Internal error. Invalid: sshfs`,
when you run `vagrant up` , you need to install vagrant sshfs plugin, which can be done by:

> ```
> vagrant plugin install vagrant--sshfs
>
> ```

and then:

> ```
> vagrant up
>
> ```

The default `Vagrantfile` forwards ports from the host to the guest,
so you can interact with the application as if it were running on your
host machine.

> Note
>
> `vagrant-hostmanager` will automatically maintain /etc/hosts for you so you
> can access the development environment from the host using its hostname, which
> by default is `pagure-dev.example.com`. You can choose not to use this
> functionality by simply not installing the `vagrant-hostmanager` plugin, but
> if you want Pagure to provide valid URLs in the UI for git repositories, you
> will need to adjust Pagure's configuration found in ~/pagure.cfg on the guest.

When the vagrant VM is up and running, connect to it with:

> ```
> vagrant ssh
>
> ```

This will log you into the VM as the user `vagrant` which has a couple of aliases
preconfigured:

> ```
> pstart            # Starts pagure, the workers and other tasks
> pstop             # Stops all those tasks again
> pstatus           # Shows pagure status
>
> ```

The Vagrant pagure doesn't have its own log file, use `journalctl -f` to
show the pagure output. The verbosity can be configured in the pagure config file
with the `LOGGING` parameter.

### Running the unit-tests in container

To run the unit-tests, there are containers available with all the dependencies needed.

> Note
>
> All build, test and shell activities executed via `run-tests-container.py` will automatically be logged.
> Every container has it's own `dev/results_<test-container-name>` folder, every run creates separate
> files with the current unix timestamp as prefix. You should cleanup this folder from time to time.

First you will need to have podman and git installed on your workstation:

> ```
> sudo dnf install podman git
>
> ```

Use the following command to run all tests on all container images, if the images not exist on your system, they will be build:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py
>
> ```

If you wish to execute the test suite on a centos based container run the following command:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py --centos
>
> ```

Container images are separated from the pagure source that will be tested.
Therefore they will only automatically build if they not exist.

A manual rebuild should be done from time to time to include new package versions.
Also if you work on any changes in the pagure spec file, the tox config or any requirements.txt file,
perform a rebuild to ensure your changed will taken into account.

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py --rebuild # all base and code container
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py --rebuild-code # code container only
>
> ```

You can also run a single test case:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py tests/test_pagure_flask_ui_priorities.py
>
> ```

Or a single test:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py tests/test_pagure_flask_ui_priorities.py:PagureFlaskPrioritiestests.test_ticket_with_no_priority
>
> ```

You can also get `run-tests-container.py` help:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py --help
>
> ```

By default, tests run against the git repo and the active branch in the current folder.
To override this behavior and run the tests on your remote development branch in your fork:

> ```
> ./dev/run-tests-container.py --repo https://pagure.io/forks/<username>/pagure.git --branch <name of branch to test>
>
> ```

### Running the unit-tests in tox

You can run the tests using tox. This allows you to run the tests on local version of the code.

> Note
>
> This way of running tests could help you test your local changes,
> but the output could be different then from the containerized tests.
> Always check your branch after push with containerized tests as well.

* Install the needed system libraries:

  ```
  sudo dnf install libgit2-devel redis gcc tox python-alembic

  ```

  Note

  You can also install any missing python interpreter.
  For example sudo dnf install python35
* Run the whole test suite:

  ```
  tox

  ```
* Or just single environment:

  ```
  tox -e py39

  ```
* Or single module:

  ```
  tox tests/test_style.py

  ```

## Manually

* Install the needed system libraries:

  ```
  sudo dnf install git python3 python3-devel libgit2-devel redis \
                   libjpeg-devel gcc libffi-devel redhat-rpm-config

  ```

  Note

  Do note the version of libgit2 that you install, for example
  in `libgit2-0.26.8-1` you need to keep in mind the `0.26`

  Note

  On RHEL and derivative (CentOS, Scientific Linux) there is no
  python3 package. Just python36 or python34 available in
  EPEL 7 (EPEL 6 only has python34). Choose the one you prefer
  (3.6 is newer and generally a better choice).
* Retrieve the sources:

  ```
  git clone https://pagure.io/pagure.git
  cd pagure

  ```
* Install dependencies

  + create the virtual environment (use python3.X explicitly on EPEL):

    ```
    python3 -m venv pagure_env
    source ./pagure_env/bin/activate

    ```
  + Install the correct version of pygit2:

    ```
    pip install pygit2==<version of libgit2 found>.*

    ```

    So in our example:

    ```
    pip install pygit2==0.26.*

    ```
  + Install the rest of the dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
* Create the folder that will receive the projects, forks, docs, requests and
  tickets' git repo:

  ```
  mkdir -p lcl/{repos,remotes,attachments,releases}

  ```
* Copy and edit the alembic.ini file (especially the `script_location` key):

  ```
  cp files/alembic.ini .
  vim alembic.ini

  ```
* Set the `script_location` to `alembic`, ie: the folder where the revisions
  are stored, relative to the location of the `alembic.ini` file.
* Create the inital database scheme:

  ```
  python createdb.py --initial alembic.ini

  ```
* Enable and start redis server:

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable redis
  sudo systemctl start redis

  ```
* Start a worker, in one terminal:

  ```
  ./runworker.py

  ```
* Run the application, in another terminal:

  ```
  ./runserver.py

  ```
* To get some profiling information you can also run it as:

  ```
  ./runserver.py --profile

  ```

This will launch the application at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>

* To run unit-tests on pagure

  + Install the dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-testing.txt

    ```
  + Run it:

    ```
    pytest tests/

    ```

    Note

    While testing for worker tasks, pagure uses celery in /usr/bin/
    Celery then looks for eventlet (which we use for testing only) at
    system level and not in virtual environment. You will need to
    install eventlet outside of your virtual environment if you are
    using one.

    Note

    This will also work in vagrant.

    Correctly handle disabled ciphers

    A cipher value could be -1, 0 or 1 meaning completely disabled,
    disabled and enabled. A -1 passed to SSL_CipherPrefSet() could
    cause a cipher to actually be enabled. Now pass PR_TRUE if
    the cipher is enabled otherwise pass PR_FALSE.

    Fix CVE-2015-5244

```
