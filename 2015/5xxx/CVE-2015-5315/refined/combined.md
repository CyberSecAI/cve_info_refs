Subject: hostapd/wpa_supplicant: EAP-pwd missing last fragment length
 validation

EAP-pwd missing last fragment length validation

Published: November 10, 2015
Identifier: CVE-2015-5314 (hostapd), CVE-2015-5315 (wpa_supplicant)
Latest version available from: <http://w1.fi/security/2015-7/>

Vulnerability

A vulnerability was found in EAP-pwd server and peer implementation used
in hostapd and wpa_supplicant, respectively. When an incoming EAP-pwd
message is fragmented, the remaining reassembly buffer length was not
checked for the last fragment (but was checked for other
fragments). This allowed a suitably constructed last fragment frame to
try to add extra data that would go beyond the buffer. The length
validation code in wpabuf_put_data() prevents an actual buffer write
overflow from occurring, but this results in process termination.

For hostapd used with an internal EAP server and EAP-pwd enabled in the
runtime configuration, this could allow a denial of service attack by an
attacker within radio range of the AP device.

For hostapd used as a RADIUS server with EAP-pwd enabled in the runtime
configuration, this could allow a denial of service attack by an
attacker within radio range of any AP device that is authorized to use
the RADIUS server.

For wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd enabled in a network configuration
profile, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker
within radio range.

Vulnerable versions/configurations

hostapd v2.0-v2.5 with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration
(hostapd/.config) and EAP-pwd authentication server enabled in runtime
configuration.

wpa_supplicant v2.0-v2.5 with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build
configuration (wpa_supplicant/.config) and EAP-pwd enabled in a network
profile at runtime.

Possible mitigation steps

- Merge the following commits and rebuild hostapd/wpa_supplicant:

  EAP-pwd peer: Fix last fragment length validation
  EAP-pwd server: Fix last fragment length validation

  These patches are available from <http://w1.fi/security/2015-7/>

- Update to hostapd/wpa_supplicant v2.6 or newer, once available

- Remove CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y from build configuration

- Disable EAP-pwd in runtime configuration

# USN-2808-1: wpa\_supplicant and hostapd vulnerabilities

10 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in wpa\_supplicant and hostapd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [wpa](/security/cves?package=wpa) - client support for WPA and WPA2

## Details

It was discovered that wpa\_supplicant incorrectly handled WMM Sleep Mode

Response frame processing. A remote attacker could use this issue to

perform broadcast/multicast packet injections, or cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2015-5310](/security/CVE-2015-5310))

It was discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled

certain EAP-pwd messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5314](/security/CVE-2015-5314), [CVE-2015-5315](/security/CVE-2015-5315))

It was discovered that wpa\_supplicant incorrectly handled certain EAP-pwd

Confirm messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a

denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10. ([CVE-2015-5316](/security/CVE-2015-5316))

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wpa_supplicant and
hostapd. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2015-4141

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered a
    vulnerability in the WPS UPnP function with HTTP chunked transfer
    encoding which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4142

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered a
    vulnerability in the WMM Action frame processing which may result in
    a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4143 CVE-2015-4144 CVE-2015-4145 CVE-2015-4146

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered that
    EAP-pwd payload is not properly validated which may result in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2015-5310

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the WMM Sleep Mode Response frame
    processing. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    mount a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5314 CVE-2015-5315

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the handling of EAP-pwd messages
    which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5316

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the handling of EAP-pwd Confirm
    messages which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-8041

    Incomplete WPS and P2P NFC NDEF record payload length validation may
    result in a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0-3+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by CVE-2015-4141, CVE-2015-4142, CVE-2015-4143 and
CVE-2015-8041.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.
