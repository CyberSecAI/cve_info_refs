  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-5279",
    "description": "A flaw was found where a QEMU emulator built with NE2000 NIC emulation support was vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow issue that occurred when receiving packets over the network. A privileged user inside a guest (VM) could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance (denial of service) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the switch.",
    "affected_components": [
      "QEMU emulator with NE2000 NIC emulation"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow in the ne2000_receive function due to improper handling of network packets.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (QEMU process crash) or arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network packets received by a vulnerable QEMU instance"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user inside a guest virtual machine (VM) is required to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the NE2000 NIC emulation support of QEMU. It requires a specific configuration where a virtual machine is running with NE2000 NIC emulation enabled.  The issue was discovered in version 4.12.1 of affected products and upgrading to software version 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue."
