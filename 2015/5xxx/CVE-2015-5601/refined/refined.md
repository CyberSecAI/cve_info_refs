Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the edx-platform application processes uploaded `.tar.gz` files during course imports.
*   The application attempts to restrict file extraction to a temporary directory but incorrectly calculates the extraction directory, assuming it is the current directory (`.`) which resolves to the edx-platform directory instead of the actual temp directory.
*   This flawed assumption allows specially crafted tar files to extract files to arbitrary locations within the edx-platform directory, bypassing intended security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** Although the application attempts to prevent path traversal using checks in `extract_tar.py`, these checks are flawed due to the incorrect assumption of the extraction directory being the current directory. This permits the creation of symbolic links to subdirectories of the `edx-platform` directory and subsequent file extraction into them.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The ability to extract files to arbitrary locations within the `edx-platform` directory leads to an arbitrary file write vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing Python files to directories in the Python library path, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the application restarts and imports those malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the user of the running process. This provides a complete compromise of the system where the edx-platform application is running.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Given that the attacker is executing code as the user running the process, it has the potential to access and compromise all data and configurations managed by that user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious .tar.gz File Upload:** The attack vector is through the course import endpoint, which accepts `.tar.gz` file uploads.
*   **Crafted Tar Archive:** An attacker must create a specially crafted `.tar.gz` archive containing:
    *   Symbolic links that point to subdirectories within the `edx-platform` directory.
    *   Python files (`.py`) with malicious code, placed to be extracted to locations where the application looks for modules when importing them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker must be a privileged user with the ability to upload course content, particularly via the course import feature. The report mentions "certain categories of privileged users," so it is not clear which roles are affected exactly.
*   **Knowledge of edx-platform Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the edx-platform directory structure, specifically the Python library paths to place malicious `.py` files to be imported during application restart.
*  **Ability to craft a malicious tar file**: The attacker must be able to craft a malicious `.tar.gz` file with symbolic links and python files as described above.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during a third-party security audit.
*   A fix was implemented in commit [https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/8902/commits](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/8902/commits).
