## Topic

Updated openshift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-
Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud
deployments.

Improper error handling in the API server can cause the master process
to crash. A user with network access to the master could cause this to
happen. (CVE-2015-5250)

This issue was discovered by Jordan Liggitt of the Red Hat OpenShift
Enterprise Team.

All OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258.>

After running the "yum update" command on each host and ensuring all
packages have been updated, restart the openshift-master service on
the master host:

# systemctl restart openshift-master

## Description

[![@nak3](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2138339?u=6a3b51aabb233d2380fdd225de6a8eea355eb97f&v=4&size=48)](/nak3)[nak3](https://github.com/nak3)opened [on Aug 26, 2015](https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/4374#issue-103204180)
## Env

```
# openshift version
openshift v1.0.5-27-g2cc96dc
kubernetes v1.1.0-alpha.0-1605-g44c91b1

# go version
go version go1.4.2 linux/amd64

```

**NOTE:** I couldn't reproduce this issue with OSE v3.0.1.0 due to another error.

## Issue:

* We can kill OpenShift process by sending request with invalid json file.
* Please see following steps.

## Reproduce steps

step-1. Start openshift origin with standalone mode, and create route and docker-registry. (Followed with [here](https://github.com/nak3/openshift-local-setup))

step-2. Send invalid json file by my [origin-killer.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nak3/23de3850fd3abf5ed038/raw/eba398a3e778459ca21ff8f60371e708566f7950/origin-killer.json)

```
[root@localhost ~]# oc create -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nak3/23de3850fd3abf5ed038/raw/eba398a3e778459ca21ff8f60371e708566f7950/origin-killer.json
imagestream "sti-python" created
Unable to connect to the server: EOF
The connection to the server 192.168.122.27:8443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
The connection to the server 192.168.122.27:8443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

```

step-3. You can see go panic and stop the OpenShift process

The log is here: <https://kenjiro.fedorapeople.org/misc/logs/origin.log> (Too long, please check from the bottom.)
