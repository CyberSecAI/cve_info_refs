| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=937786#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-07-13 07:55:22 UTC  ``` Courtesy bug from the SUSE Security team: <http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=3246> 0003246: No CSRF token - requests can be forged  No CSRF token is used when creating events in calendar, adding contacts, ... An attacker can therefore prepare a website that triggers POST requests for a victim to preform actions under his/her account.  only the username of the victim needs to be known.  - create a new contact - intercept and save the request - replace your username with the username of the victim in the request - create a webpage that sends the POST request automatically - lure the victim into visiting your webpage - if the victim is still logged in the action will be performed (ie. send him/her an email with a link to your site)     Dear maintainers, no upstream release is available. Reference this bug and CVE when you commit a patch or submit a fixed release.  References: <http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=3246> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5395> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/86> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5395> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=937786#c1)  Christian Schweingruber   2015-08-10 06:37:16 UTC  ``` this issue needs to be solved upstream ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=937786#c2)  Christian Schweingruber   2019-06-18 08:56:54 UTC  ``` The issue is resolved upstream for Versions 3 and 4 of SOGo: <https://sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=3246>  <https://github.com/inverse-inc/sogo/commit/582baf2960969c73f98643e46cfb49432c30b711> ``` |  |

| Summary | 0003246: No CSRF token - requests can be forged | | | | |
| Description | No CSRF token is used when creating events in calendar, adding contacts, ... An attacker can therefore prepare a website that triggers POST requests for a victim to preform actions under his/her account.  only the username of the victim needs to be known. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | * create a new contact * intercept and save the request * replace your username with the username of the victim in the request * create a webpage that sends the POST request automatically * lure the victim into visiting your webpage * if the victim is still logged in the action will be performed (ie. send him/her an email with a link to your site) | | | | |
| Tags | No tags attached. | | | | |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Hi Markus,

Sorry for the late reply. This bug also isn't fixed in jessie, the
reason for this is that upstream isn't going to fix this for SOGo 2
and earlier. The security bug is about the complete lack of CSRF
protection and implementing that is going to be a lot of work. SOGo 3
has a complete new frontend and that has CSRF protection now, so I
think it is best to just mark SOGo as unsupported in wheezy-lts. I
haven't had the time yet to finish packaging SOGo 3, but I'll be at
debcamp next month and should have enough time then to do that and
create a backport for jessie.

Kind regards,

Jeroen Dekkers

# Contributing to Debian Long Term Support

The Debian LTS team is always looking for more volunteers to do a better job. With more resources, we could for example:

* support packages that are currently unsupported
* take care of all Debian packages and not only the most popular ones
* fix lower priority issues

If you want to get involved in the LTS team and help keep Debian packages secure for 5 years, have a look at this page. We assume that you are already familiar with the repository layout described in [LTS/Using](/LTS/Using) and that you are subscribed to the LTS mailing list: <http://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/>

You can help in many ways:

## Test updated packages and report regressions

As a simple user, you can test packages that have been updated (or that are in the process of being updated). If you find a regression (i.e. something that used to work and that no longer works), then please report it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org and put the person who prepared the update in copy (in case they are not subscribed to the list).

Many LTS contributors are looking for testers of their updated packages. They send call for tests on the mailing list, so please [subscribe to it](http://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/) and test the packages they provide when you can, and report back whether they worked for you.

## Debian Security Tracker

The Debian LTS team makes extensive use of the [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/). This is a database of all known security issues in Debian.

Developers check out the Git source (see [instructions](/LTS/Development#checkout-security-tracker-repo)), commit changes, and the website automatically updates to reflect the changes.

LTS Developers are strongly encouraged to keep the data in the security tracker up-to-date. This includes updating the following files:

* data/CVE/list: Should be updated with broader information that affects more than just LTS (i.e., stable, testing). For example, consider adding to this file links to bug reports related to the security issue, links to upstream commits or new releases which address the vulnerability, links to public mailing list posts, upstream reports, upstream exploits, information regarding if the exploits do or do not work, etc. Any information that could be useful for the security team as well as the LTS team.
* data/dla-needed.txt: Should be updated to reflect LTS specific information, such as who is working on a package, possible issues that are specific to LTS, test packages available, requests for help, problems encountered, etc.
* data/DLA/list: In most cases there is no need to manually change this file, as it is maintained automatically by bin/gen-DLA which is described in following sections.

Make sure to read [its documentation](https://security-team.debian.org/security_tracker.html) on the Debian Security Team website.

## Prepare security updates for LTS

### Claim the issue in the security tracker (in dla-needed.txt)

In order to prevent duplication of effort, make sure the issue is listed in the [data/dla-needed.txt](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/blob/master/data/dla-needed.txt) file from the security tracker and add your name to it. Normally, issues are triaged by the frontdesk in dla-needed.txt at first. If not, you should add the issue to dla-needed.txt yourself. Look at how that is done [below](/LTS/Development#Guidelines_for_CVE_triaging) before adding an issue or adding your name to an issue.

We give package maintainers 24 to 72 hours delay before taking on updates ourselves, depending on the severity of the security issue.

As mentioned in the previous section, make sure to also review and update the relevant information in data/CVE/list when claiming a package for LTS work.

You shall only claim it for the time you do active work. You are expected to actively handle the problem within 2-3 days and then you are expected to announce your intention to upload so others can test it for a few (3-4) more days. If you can not solve the problem within the 2-3 days, then please mention why it takes more time, how far you have gone, the preliminary results and/or free it for someone else to work on it. We do not want people to work on a package for a few hours, wait a few days, work again on it, wait more and so on.

 Checkout the git repository of the security tracker: (Using a shallow clone because otherwise the operation will take half an hour. The clone will still need a few minutes to complete.)
```
$ git clone --depth 1 git@salsa.debian.org:security-tracker-team/security-tracker
$ cd security-tracker
$ sudo apt install jq python3-apt
$ bin/setup-repo
```

setup-repo installs a pre-commit hook to check data file syntax.

Then edit the data/dla-needed.txt file:
```
$ editor data/dla-needed.txt
$ git commit -m "Claim foo in dla-needed.txt" data/dla-needed.txt
$ git push
```

**Write access to the security-tracker repository**

Debian Developers automatically have commit access to the security-tracker repository. Otherwise you need to be a member of the security-tracker project on salsa.debian.org, please request membership through the [security tracker team gitlab project](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/), [security-tracker mailinglist](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-tracker/) or [debian-lts mailinglist](/LTS/Contact#debian-lts).

### Build the update

Backport the fix to the version in LTS (in case there's already been an earlier update). Make sure that the fix was approved by the upstream project (e.g. committed to their development repository), sometimes early patches proposals are erroneous or incomplete. If there is no fix, it is fine to work on a new one: be a good citizen and contribute the patch back upstream and make sure the maintainer and regular security teams will be aware of them, by adding it to a bug report against the package and linking that bug report in the security tracker. (If the issue being addressed requires AddressSanitizer in order to reproduce the vulnerability and confirm the fix, then [this page](/LTS/Development/Asan) may be helpful).

If the fix comes with new binary files (e.g. test cases), they won't be accepted by quilt, but you can reference them in debian/source/include-binaries and they'll be included in the .debian.tar.xz file directly ([discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2021/02/msg00008.html)).

In the changelog, you need to set the target distribution in debian/changelog to "**stretch-security**". The versioning follows the conventions already used in security.debian.org. Historically codenames have been used as version numbers, but this was changed some time ago as version numbers are more deterministic.

* If you use dch (pre-buster) to make the changelog entry, note that it may include the text *Non-maintainer upload by the Security Team.* It is important to either remove the line, remove *by the Security Team*, or replace it with something referring to the LTS Team, to avoid giving the appearance of support by the Security Team. Cf [762715](https://bugs.debian.org/762715 "DebianBug") ("Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.").
* If a package already e.g. had a +deb9u1 update, use +deb9u2 for the next update.
* If a package hasn't seen an update, use +deb9u1 for the next update.
* For the rare cases where new upstream versions are introduced, make sure to use a lower version than in stretch. See [discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2020/06/msg00008.html). Just don't use +stretchX as this will cause problems!
* For the rare case where backports of the entire package from newer distributions is required (as opposed to just the fix), it is expected that the changelog will not be in incrementing version order.

BTS numbers can be referenced but are currently [not processed](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2020/02/msg00048.html).

Note that for non-native packages, uploads to security-master need to include the source tarball (even if it's already present in the distribution you're uploading to) by using 'dpkg-buildpackage -sa'.

Make sure you use a clean chroot for building the binary packages. Using [sbuild](/sbuild)/[pbuilder](/pbuilder) is recommended. For instance:
```
# Init
sudo pbuilder --create --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz --distribution stretch --othermirror 'deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib'
sudo pbuilder --update --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz
# Rebuild source and binary packages from Stretch (in extracted source)
export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=$(nproc)"
pdebuild --use-pdebuild-internal --buildresult .. --debbuildopts '-S' -- --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz
# Rebuild binary packages from Stretch, reproducing buildd's separate build-indep/build-arch
# - first security upload:
sudo --preserve-env=DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS pbuilder --build --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz --source-only-changes --logfile build-indep.log --buildresult . --binary-indep --debbuildopts '-sa' package+deb9u1.dsc
sudo --preserve-env=DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS pbuilder --build --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz --source-only-changes --logfile build-arch.log  --buildresult . --binary-arch  --debbuildopts '-sa' package+deb9u1.dsc
# - later uploads:
sudo --preserve-env=DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS pbuilder --build --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz --source-only-changes --logfile build-indep.log --buildresult . --binary-indep package+deb9u2.dsc
sudo --preserve-env=DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS pbuilder --build --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-stretch.tgz --source-only-changes --logfile build-arch.log  --buildresult . --binary-arch  package+deb9u2.dsc
```

To actually build the binary package, you may want to use a porter box, especially if you need to fix a regression that concerns a specific architecture you may not have access to, see [PorterBoxHowToUse](/PorterBoxHowToUse) for instructions on how to use porterboxes.

See also:

* [Debian Developer's Reference - Preparing packages to address security issues](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.html#preparing-packages-to-address-security-issues)
* [Requesting wanna-build actions](https://release.debian.org/wanna-build.txt) if your package failed to build and you need a gb/giveback/give-back (and the build failure can't actually be fixed cleanly)

### Test the update

See [TestSuites](/LTS/TestSuites) for package-specific test instructions.

If there's a built-in test suite, make sure it runs fine at build-time in the LTS environment. It is acceptable to enable or even backport test suites from later releases if they are available.

There can also be [DEP-8](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep8/) tests in debian/tests, to run with [autopkgtest](https://packages.debian.org/autopkgtest). See for instance [TestSuites/rails](/LTS/TestSuites/rails) for a direct run or [TestSuites/sane-backends](/LTS/TestSuites/sane-backends) for a full LXC environment.

If there are no test suites available, you will need to run and test the package directly. Prefer a full environment (virtualized or sometimes even physical).

Do check the reverse-dependencies (find-rdeps, [apt-rdepends](https://packages.debian.org/apt-rdepends) -r, [dose-ceve](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dose-extra/dose-ceve.1.en.html#EXAMPLES) from [dose-extra](https://packages.debian.org/dose-extra)) and install some of them, to check if your package still runs correctly with them.

It is worth testing with both a 32- and 64-bit architecture, see e.g. [CVE-2019-14866](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2019/11/msg00005.html).

Check your package update with generic tools as well:
```
# check for common packaging issues in last build
# from extracted source after build, stretch host (only check new errors)
lintian -i
# inspect source changes
debdiff package+deb9u3.dsc package+deb9u4.dsc | diffstat
debdiff package+deb9u3.dsc package+deb9u4.dsc | less
# inspect binary changes
debdiff --from deb9u3/*.deb --to deb9u4/*.deb
# test package upgrade
sudo piuparts -d stretch \
  --extra-repo='deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib' \
  -l piuparts-package.log \
  -I :etc/buggy-dep \
  --single-changes-list package+deb9u4_{all,amd64}.changes \
  | grep -P '(INFO|ERROR):'
# also consider --install-remove-install
```

Depending on the urgency of the security fix, and your confidence on your own work, you might want to seek reviews from interested parties (such as upstream authors, Debian maintainers, security team, LTS team, etc.). If you ask for reviews, you should supply the following information:

1. A generated debdiff against the previous version in LTS.
2. A link to a test package that can be downloaded and tested.

It is common for LTS workers to upload their packages to a personal repository in [people.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch04.en.html#servers-people), but any public repository or even simple webserver will do. A few guidelines for those temporary uploads:

* sign the packages (using debsign, for example) so that users can verify package integrity
* make sure to have the target distribution set to UNRELEASED so that nobody else can upload them before they are ready.

### Upload the update

Uploads to Debian LTS **do not wait** for a DLA or any other manual intervention before being installed into the Debian Archive. In this regard, they are different from stable security uploads.

If you're satisfied with your tests, upload to security-master, using [dput](https://packages.debian.org/dput "DebianPackage") or [dput-ng](https://packages.debian.org/dput-ng "DebianPackage"):

```
dput security-master hello_1.0-1+deb9u1_source.changes
```

Once uploaded the package will be auto-built for all the available architectures (if it's an arch:any package). The architectures currently supported are amd64, i386, armel and armhf. Check the build logs at: <https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?suite=stretch-security&p=SOURCE_PACKAGE>

*Built-Using refers to non-existing source package*: if your package is rejected with this reason, open a bug against package ftp.debian.org requesting to add the missing package, see e.g. [974877](https://bugs.debian.org/974877 "DebianBug") or [974954](https://bugs.debian.org/974954 "DebianBug").

### Claim a DLA ID in DLA/list

Once your upload has been built successfully, you can go ahead with the DLA.

Run bin/gen-DLA in the top directory of the Git repository. It automatically generates an entry in data/DLA/list and asks you to commit the changes to ensure that no IDs are used twice. The following command would add an entry for src:hello fixing CVE-2014-0666 and creates an advisory template in the top directory of your security-tracker checkout.

```
$ DEBFULLNAME=xxx bin/gen-DLA --save hello CVE-2014-0666
# OR
$ DEBFULLNAME=xxx bin/gen-DLA --save .../hello_1.2-3+deb9u4_source.changes
```

That list of CVE will make sure that the security tracker is aware of the fix and mark the issues as resolved for that specific package.

gen-DLA will automatically remove prior suite triage for the fixed vulnerabilities (e.g. [stretch] - package <postponed>). However, the {DLA-XXXX-1} annotation will be added by the bi-daily cron, and the fixed version will be inferred automatically (don't add it).

### Special case: Upload non-free packages

Currently (20220119) source-only uploads of non-free packages to security-master are not possible (according to Aurélien Jarno this is a bug). The buildd will not build the package for different architectures. The LTS team still maintains packages like [amd64-microcode](https://packages.debian.org/amd64-microcode) and [firmware-linux-nonfree](https://packages.debian.org/firmware-linux-nonfree).

New upstream releases should include the full "source-code" and the amd64 binary packages (build with -sa and upload the amd64 changes file).

After that you need to upload only the i386 binary packages as well. This can be achieved by passing the -b flag to dpkg-buildpackage. You can also use the changestool from [reprepro](https://packages.debian.org/reprepro) to modify your changes file and to exclude unwanted files from it.

### Announce the update

Once the upload is completed, an email will be sent to you and to the [debian-lts-changes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-changes) mailing list, confirming the update has been released into the Debian archive. The BTS bot will also announce it in the #debian-devel-changes channel.

Send mail to the [debian-lts-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/) mailing list. The mail needs to be signed by an OpenPGP key in the debian or debian-maintainers keyring. Inline signatures always work (PGP/MIME works with mutt but fails with Enigmail. Thunderbird fails starting from version 76).

The advisory template has been created by bin/gen-DLA (see before) and generally looks like this:

```
Subject: [SECURITY] [DLA $DLA-1] $SOURCEPACKAGENAME security update

Package        : $SOURCEPACKAGENAME
Version        : $LTS_VERSION
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0001 CVE-2014-0002
Debian Bug     : 12345

DLA text goes here
[...]
```

In addition to describing the vulnerabilities, remember to add a short package description, so the audience can better understand the context and whether they are affected.

Please also don't append your personal signatures to DLAs.

If you use mutt, a simple way to send it is to use
```
mutt -e "set signature=/dev/null" -H DLA-123
```

Simple "mail" command works:
```
cat DLA-XXXX.txt | gpg --clearsign | mail -s "[SECURITY] [DLA XXXX-X] $SOURCEPACKAGENAME security update" -a "From: Max Mustermann <max.mustermann@debian.org>" -r max.mustermann@debian.org debian-lts-announce@lists.debian.org
```

Only when you have confirmed that the package was processed after upload (once you get the accept email) should you send the DLA to the mailing list.

When all this is done, you should remove the package from other locations it was uploaded to in the test section, if any.

* [DebianSecurity/AdvisoryCreation/SecFull#Sending\_out\_the\_announcement\_to\_debian-security-announce](/DebianSecurity/AdvisoryCreation/SecFull#Sending_out_the_announcement_to_debian-security-announce)

### Prepare an update for the website

After sending the email, you must also prepare an update for the main debian.org web site with the new announcement. The benefits of posting to the web site are;

* permalinks: <https://www.debian.org/lts/security/20XX/dla-XXX>
* i18n: mark for translation (if the translators wish to)
* DLAs are considered to be equally as important as DSAs.

For this you need a copy of the website source. This is a one-time setup:
