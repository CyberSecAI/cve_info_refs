Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in SOGo versions prior to 3.1.0. Specifically, the application did not use a CSRF token for actions like creating calendar events or adding contacts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF protection mechanisms. This allows an attacker to forge requests and trick a user's browser into executing actions without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could force a logged-in user to perform actions on the SOGo system without the user's consent. These actions could include:
    *   Creating new contacts.
    *   Adding calendar events.
    *   Modifying settings like setting an email forward, potentially redirecting emails to the attacker.
*   **Account Compromise:** By manipulating settings, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to create or alter data through forged requests could lead to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attack:** The attack vector is primarily web-based. An attacker crafts a malicious web page or link that contains the forged requests.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker lures a victim into visiting the crafted malicious web page while the victim is logged into their SOGo account.
*   **POST Request Forgery:** The forged requests are typically sent as POST requests to the SOGo server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target Username:** The attacker needs to know the username of the victim but does not necessarily require the password.
*   **Ability to Create Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to create a web page that automatically sends crafted POST requests.
*   **Social Engineering Ability:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the malicious page while the victim is logged in to their SOGo account.
*   **No Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability does not bypass authentication. The attacker exploits an existing valid session of a user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in SOGo version 3.1.0 and later with the addition of XSRF token support.
*   The issue was initially reported on the SOGo bug tracker with the ID 3246.
*   The fix was implemented with a commit on GitHub: `https://github.com/inverse-inc/sogo/commit/582baf2960969c73f98643e46cfb49432c30b711`
*   Debian Wheezy LTS is not supported, the issue is resolved in Debian Bullseye, Bookworm, Sid and Trixie.
*   The severity is considered high by Ubuntu with a CVSS v3 score of 8.8.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker with a low attack complexity and no required privileges to cause high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability through user interaction.
