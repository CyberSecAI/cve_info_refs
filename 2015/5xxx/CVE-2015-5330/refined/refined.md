{
  "CVE-2015-5330": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Samba LDAP server mishandles string lengths due to an issue in ldb, leading to a remote memory read attack.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper string length handling in ldb leads to a remote memory read vulnerability in the Samba LDAP server.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information from daemon heap memory by sending crafted packets and then reading either an error message or a database value.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attack via crafted packets to the Samba LDAP server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted packets to a vulnerable Samba server and be able to interpret the error messages and data returned."
  },
  "CVE-2015-8467": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper privilege checks in the samldb_check_user_account_control_acl function within Samba when creating machine accounts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Samba does not properly check for administrative privileges, leading to bypass of access restrictions during machine account creation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote authenticated user can create a machine account, bypassing intended access restrictions in a domain with both Samba DC and Windows DC. This can also lead to a denial of service of the windows DCs.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attack by authenticated users exploiting the machine account creation process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have valid user credentials within a domain that uses both a Samba DC and a Windows DC."
  },
  "CVE-2016-2110": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NTLMSSP authentication implementation in Samba allows man-in-the-middle attackers to perform protocol-downgrade attacks by removing application-layer flags or encryption settings.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The NTLMSSP authentication implementation in Samba does not prevent the modification of the client-server data stream to remove application-layer flags or encryption settings.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can modify the client-server data stream to remove the NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SEAL or NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SIGN options, which disrupts LDAP security and allows a protocol downgrade attack.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks that target the NTLMSSP authentication implementation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be positioned as a man-in-the-middle to modify the client-server data stream during NTLMSSP authentication."
  },
    "CVE-2015-5296": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Samba allows connections that are encrypted but unsigned, which can be downgraded by an attacker.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Samba does not enforce signing when creating an encrypted client connection, allowing an attacker to downgrade the connection to unencrypted.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can downgrade an encrypted but unsigned connection to an unsigned, unencrypted connection.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a machine-in-the-middle position in the network traffic between a client and a server, able to modify the connection negotiation process."
  },
  "CVE-2015-7540": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LDAP server in Samba's AD domain controller does not properly validate memory allocation when processing ASN.1 data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Samba's AD domain controller's LDAP server doesn't check return values when allocating memory, which can lead to memory exhaustion.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (memory consumption and daemon crash) by sending crafted packets to the LDAP server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network attack by sending crafted packets to the Samba LDAP server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to send crafted packets to the Samba LDAP server."
  },
  "CVE-2015-5252": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient symlink verification in Samba when specific share names have substring relationships.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Samba improperly verifies symlinks when share names with specific substring relationships exist, which leads to a bypass of intended file-access restrictions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can use a symlink to access files outside of an exported share path.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker can exploit symlink handling by using share names with certain substring relationships.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker with knowledge of the vulnerability can exploit it in specific share name configurations."
  },
    "CVE-2015-5299": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing access control check in the VFS shadow_copy2 module within Samba.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Samba incorrectly performs access control checks when using the VFS shadow_copy2 module.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could use this issue to access snapshots, contrary to intended permissions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attack by visiting a shadow copy directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access a shadow copy directory via the SMB protocol."
