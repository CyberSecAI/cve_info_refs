Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient escaping of the `ModalWindow` title in Apache Wicket. The `getWindowOpenJavaScript()` method within the `org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.modal.ModalWindow` class only used `escapeQuotes()` which only escaped quotes in the title. This allowed JavaScript code to be injected into the markup because JavaScript without quotes can still be executed by browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `escapeQuotes()` method was inadequate to prevent JavaScript injection, as it did not escape other characters that could be used to construct a JavaScript payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Potential Security Threat:** If the injected JavaScript contains user-provided data, it might compromise the user's session, steal sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*  **UI Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript could alter the behavior or appearance of the webpage in a malicious way.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Title Input:** The attacker provides a specially crafted title for the `ModalWindow` that contains JavaScript code. For instance, the example given was a title model returning a string such as: `<i onclick=alert(1)>stuff</i>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control ModalWindow Title:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the title model of the `ModalWindow`. This might involve manipulating data that is displayed in the title.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the ModalWindow is rendered, and the malicious JavaScript in the title is executed when the user interacts with it (e.g., by clicking on the title, or the page load).

**Additional Details:**

* The issue was present in Apache Wicket versions 1.5.x, 6.x and 7.x.
* The fix involved escaping the title by default. This can be disabled by explicitly using `modalWindow.setEscapeModelStrings(false)`.
* The vulnerability was reported by Tobias Gierke.
* The fix was released in versions 1.5.15, 6.22.0 and 7.2.0.
