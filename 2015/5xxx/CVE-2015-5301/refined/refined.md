Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5301:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ipsilon Identity Provider (IdP) software lacked proper authorization checks when deleting a service provider.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing user authorization check: The code did not verify if the user attempting to delete a service provider had the necessary permissions to do so.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Any authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability to delete any service provider, potentially disrupting services that rely on those providers.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by making network requests to the Ipsilon server to delete service providers.
- Authenticated User: An attacker needs to be a valid user who is authenticated to the Ipsilon IdP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Ipsilon IdP.
- Network access to the Ipsilon IdP server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in `ipsilon/providers/saml2/admin.py`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check for permissions before deleting a SAML2 Service Provider.
- The upstream patch is available at: `https://pagure.io/ipsilon/9dec97c3c83928d231ea10f4160523a13803e594`.
