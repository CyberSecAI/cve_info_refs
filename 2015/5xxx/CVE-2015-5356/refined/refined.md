Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5356:

**Verification:** The provided content from the GitHub repository of GetSimpleCMS specifically references and describes a vulnerability related to "filebrowser arbitrary js injection" (Issue #1059) which was addressed in release v3.3.6. While the CVE description is missing, based on the issue title, commit message and description this issue relates to CVE-2015-5356.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `filebrowser.php` file, specifically how the `func` GET parameter is handled. The code was directly outputting the value of the `func` parameter into a JavaScript function call within the `if(window.opener)` block, without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability in `admin/filebrowser.php`. The script was taking unsanitized input from the `func` GET parameter and embedding it directly into the page's JavaScript, making it possible to inject malicious JS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing, Key Logging, CSRF Bypass:** As a result of the arbitrary JavaScript execution, an attacker could steal cookies, perform keylogging, and bypass CSRF protection.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The CSRF bypass could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities, such as the theme editor, to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is a crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `func` parameter when calling the `filebrowser.php` script.
*   The `filebrowser.php` script is called within an iframe from another admin page within GetSimple CMS, so the attacker has to inject the javascript into the parent page which then calls the file browser in an iframe.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to convince an authenticated admin user to click on a link with the crafted `func` parameter.
*   The attacker must be able to construct a URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   The attacker must target a victim that is logged into GetSimple CMS.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix included in the commit `cb1845743bd11ba74a49b6b522c080df86a17d51` sanitized the `func` parameter using `var_out()` which would prevent the injection of malicious JS, therefore fixing the vulnerability.

*   The issue description mentions the risk as "Medium-High", highlighting the potential for significant impact.
