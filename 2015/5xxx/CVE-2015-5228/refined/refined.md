Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The criu (Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace) service daemon creates log and dump files in an insecure manner. Specifically, it uses a user-supplied directory path for these files without proper sanitization or access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** The vulnerability allows for the creation of arbitrary files at user-specified locations.
*   **Arbitrary Chown:**  Local users can take ownership of existing files due to the insecure file creation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. This is because they can create files with root ownership or take ownership of existing root-owned files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to access the system locally to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User-Supplied Directory Path:** The attack relies on the ability to supply a directory path to the criu daemon, where the daemon will then create log and dump files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:**  The attacker needs a local user account on the system where the vulnerable criu daemon is running.
*   **Ability to Interact with criu Daemon:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the criu daemon in a way that allows them to control the destination path for log and dump files.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue is related to the insecure handling of user-supplied paths during the creation of log and dump files.
*   The upstream discussion about hardening the criu service daemon can be found at: `http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-August/021847.html`
*   SUSE indicates that the vulnerability does not affect their products. However, they provided a patch for openSUSE Tumbleweed.
*   Red Hat also acknowledged and fixed the vulnerability: `https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1255782`
