Date: Tue, 25 Aug 2015 14:03:18 +0200
From: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2015-5228 & CVE-2015-5231 in the criu service daemon

This is just a heads-up that a discussion about hardening the criu
service daemon is now happening upstream:

  <<http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-August/021847.html>>

Considering impact (the service is not widely used right now), we
decided to discuss the new design in the open.  Please contribute to the
discussion on the criu mailing list if you are interested.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1255782#c0)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-21 14:31:55 UTC  ``` It was discovered that local users could use the criu daemon to create arbitrary files and take ownership of existing files, due to the creation of log and dump files in a user-supplied directory path. This allows unprivileged local users to gain root privileges.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1255782#c4)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-25 11:40:45 UTC  ```  Created criu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1256747](show_bug.cgi?id=1256747 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5228 CVE-2015-5231 criu: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1255782#c5)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-25 11:59:53 UTC  ``` Upstream discussion:    <http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-August/021847.html>   ``` |  |
