  "CVE-2015-5283": {
    "description": "The sctp_init function in net/sctp/protocol.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.3 has an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic or memory corruption) by creating SCTP sockets before all of the steps have finished.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel (net/sctp/protocol.c)"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps in the sctp_init function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition during SCTP module initialization",
      "Uninitialized memory access due to premature socket creation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash, memory corruption).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local users creating SCTP sockets before module initialization completes."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create SCTP sockets locally."
    ],
    "additional_notes": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered when the SCTP module is unloaded and is being requested due to a user creating an SCTP socket.",
      "The race condition happens because user space can create SCTP sockets after the call to sctp_v{4,6}_protosw_init() is completed, and before register_pernet_subsys() is called.",
       "The fix involves splitting netns initialization in two moments: defaults and control socket, so that the defaults are already loaded by when we register the protocol, while control socket initialization is kept at the same moment it is today.",
      "The issue was introduced in Linux kernel version v3.7-rc1 and fixed in v4.3-rc3"
