Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a reflected file download issue in the Red Hat Mobile platform. The platform's service allows an attacker to craft a URL that, when accessed, results in the browser downloading a file with attacker-controlled content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected File Download:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of input parameters, specifically the `_callback` parameter in the `install.cmd` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content which is then returned by the server, causing the browser to interpret the response as a file download.
*   The server echoes the attacker-controlled `_callback` parameter in the response, leading to the reflected file download.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can trick a user into downloading and executing arbitrary code on their machine. This is achieved by injecting malicious code into the file content which is downloaded by the browser.
*   **Spoofing/Phishing:**  Attackers can use the vulnerability to create URLs that appear to originate from the Red Hat Mobile platform, making it easier to trick users into downloading and running malicious files. These URLs can be embedded in spoofed or phishing emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector involves the creation of specially crafted URLs that include malicious code within the `_callback` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **URL Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes a malicious payload in the `_callback` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL. This often involves techniques such as phishing emails or social media links.
*   **No Authentication Required**:  The vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a **LOW** severity because it requires user interaction to download and execute a malicious file. Additionally, not all browsers are vulnerable to this issue.
*   The vulnerability was closed as **WONTFIX**, meaning that it will not be fixed by Red Hat.
