Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5937:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple memory corruption issues existed in the parsing of image metadata within the ImageIO framework.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate validation of image metadata, which allows for memory corruption when processing maliciously crafted image files.
*   **Impact:** Viewing or processing a maliciously crafted image file can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious image file that, when viewed or processed by a vulnerable application, triggers the memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to get a user to process the maliciously crafted image file either through a website, an email attachment, or any other method where the affected systems would process the image file.

**Affected Products:**

*   Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Edition, and Apple Watch Hermes running watchOS 2.0.1
*   iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later running iOS 9.1
*   OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10.5, and OS X El Capitan 10.11
