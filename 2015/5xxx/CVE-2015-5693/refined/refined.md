- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the path processing of command URLs accessed through the management port of Symantec Web Gateway. A crafted URL can cause the Web Gateway to execute a command that should not be available externally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path processing for command URLs accessible via the management port, leading to the execution of unintended commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands under the context of root on vulnerable installations of Symantec Web Gateway.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted URL to the management port of the Symantec Web Gateway.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted URL to the management port of the gateway. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
