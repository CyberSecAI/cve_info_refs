Is horrible even if you uninstall it will leave you a lot of bugs… I can’t make ads in google because of that plugin.

I used this plugin for some years, and the plugin has so many bugs and a odd way to add features in wordpress. The support ends in 2019. So, there is no chance to keep using this…
So, I had to create my own plugin. All features I need is working now and my site increase speed.

Difficult to install, full of ads, no usage instructions, rubbish results. Avoid!

### [Garbage](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/garbage-81/)

The formatting is incorrect. My logo on the Svbtle template overflows the logo area. Trying to launch the visual editor or delete a landing page emits several warning messages. There’s no readily apparent way to delete a variation. Obviously, this plugin is no longer supported by the company and doesn’t work well with WP 4.9 or above.

This Plugin is useless, the formatting does not work and the plugins are ugly and buggy.
