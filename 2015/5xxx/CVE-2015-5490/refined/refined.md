The provided content includes a request for CVE IDs for multiple Drupal module vulnerabilities. One of them is related to the "Views" module.

**CVE-2015-5490** is associated with Drupal's "Views" module and corresponds to **SA-CONTRIB-2015-103**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to broken views data cache entries. This indicates a problem in how the Views module caches data, leading to potential access bypass issues.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The primary vulnerability is an access bypass. It suggests a flaw that allows users to see data they shouldn't have access to, possibly due to improper caching or access control checks in the module's code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker could potentially bypass access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to data, which could lead to information disclosure or other security breaches.
*  **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the Views module itself, by exploiting flaws in the data caching mechanism.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need to be a user of the affected Drupal site and somehow trigger the faulty caching mechanism to gain access to unauthorized content.

The provided commit log entry seems to be a fix for the issue, ensuring that no broken view data cache entries are created, aligning with the vulnerability description.
