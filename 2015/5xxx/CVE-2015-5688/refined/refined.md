The provided content is related to CVE-2015-5688.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Geddy framework, by default, was serving static files from not only the public folder but also from underlying OS folders. This was due to insufficient input sanitization of requested file paths when serving static assets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The application did not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the path to the static files being served. This allowed an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the URL to access files outside of the intended static file directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server's filesystem, such as configuration files, source code, or other data not intended for public access. In the provided example, the attacker was able to access `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the application, using a specially crafted URL with directory traversal sequences to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is running.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to perform this attack.
