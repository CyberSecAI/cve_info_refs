Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-5312:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The `xmlStringLenDecodeEntities` function in `parser.c` of libxml2 does not properly prevent entity expansion. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-3660, but it has a similar outcome.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Improper handling of entity expansion within XML documents, leading to potential resource exhaustion (CPU consumption) by processing crafted XML data.
   - Memory corruption issues in the handling of XML documents.
   - Potential for denial of service.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Denial of Service (DoS) through excessive CPU consumption by processing a maliciously crafted XML or HTML document.
   - Potential application crashes.
    -  Exposure of potentially sensitive data or memory layout in some instances.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - Processing a crafted XML document, either locally or remotely.
    - A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a specially crafted XML document.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities within web services and/or other applications using libxml2.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Ability to provide or trick an application into processing a malicious XML document.
  - Ability to send crafted XML data to a vulnerable system via the network or other means.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in libxml2 versions prior to 2.9.3.
*   Several sources mention this CVE as part of a larger batch of vulnerabilities that were fixed together in libxml2.
*   The issue is often related to handling of XML entity expansions, particularly with crafted or malformed XML data that can consume excessive resources.
* The reports indicate that a fix was implemented by limiting entity expansion in affected functions and adding checks for potential errors or inconsistencies within the XML data to stop or properly handle parsing errors.
*   Patches often involve a combination of improved memory handling, input validation, and improved error handling or exiting from processing routines.
*   Some reports show the vulnerability could potentially cause memory disclosure if not handled correctly in addition to DoS.
*    Some sources indicate this vulnerability can be exploited both locally or remotely
