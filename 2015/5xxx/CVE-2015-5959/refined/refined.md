Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5959:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the logging of database passwords in plaintext within error messages generated by the Froxlor application. Specifically, the `class.Database.php` file was directly including database credentials in the error messages and traces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive database passwords (both the unprivileged user password and the root password) in log files.
*   **Insecure Logging:** The application was writing error logs, including the aforementioned passwords, to a publicly accessible directory `/logs/sql-error.log` without proper access controls in the default configuration/setup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker could access the `/logs/sql-error.log` file (due to the publicly accessible directory), extract database passwords.
*   With access to these passwords, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability via web access to the server hosting Froxlor application. By navigating to `/logs/sql-error.log`, they can retrieve the stored passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Froxlor installation.
*   No prior authentication is required, as the directory containing the log files was publicly reachable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves masking passwords within the error messages by replacing them with `DB_UNPRIV_PWD` and `DB_ROOT_PWD` strings. This prevents plaintext passwords from appearing in log files.
*   The fix also includes deleting the existing log file.
*   The vulnerability was present in Froxlor version 0.9.33.1 and earlier.
*  The fix included a change to log errors to syslog instead of `/logs/sql-error.log`, but that wasn't the primary vulnerability being addressed by CVE-2015-5959.
