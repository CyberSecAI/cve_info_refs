Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5349:

**CVE-2015-5349** is related to a command injection vulnerability in Apache Directory Studio's CSV export functionality.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper escaping of fields when exporting data to CSV format. This allows a malicious user to inject specially crafted values into an LDAP server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Output Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize output when exporting to CSV, specifically when handling values that could be interpreted as formulas by spreadsheet applications.
- **CSV Injection:** This is a specific type of injection where data intended to be plain text is interpreted and executed as a formula by a spreadsheet program.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Command Execution:** When a user exports the specially crafted data into a CSV file and then opens it in a spreadsheet application (like Excel), the malicious content will be interpreted as a formula and executed. This could lead to a wide range of impacts from data exfiltration to local system compromise depending on the formulas injected.
- **Potential System Compromise:** The impact extends beyond just the spreadsheet application, as attackers could potentially exploit the formula execution to run code on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Data Injection:** An attacker injects malicious formulas into LDAP attribute values on a directory server.
- **CSV Export:** A user with access to Apache Directory Studio exports the data to a CSV format.
- **Spreadsheet Application:** The user opens the CSV file using a vulnerable spreadsheet application (like Excel).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **LDAP Server Access:** The attacker must have the ability to modify data within an LDAP server instance which is being managed by the vulnerable Apache Directory Studio instance.
- **Knowledge of Formula Syntax:** The attacker needs to know the syntax for formulas in the target spreadsheet application in order to craft a malicious payload.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker depends on a user to export the data to CSV and open the file with a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content indicates that this issue is resolved in Apache Directory Studio version 2.0.0-M10.
- The provided release notes explicitly mention "CVE-2015-5349 - Command Injection through LDAP CSV export", confirming the vulnerability.
- The content does not specify the exact version of spreadsheet software vulnerable to this attack, but the general concept of CSV injection is well known to affect multiple spreadsheet applications.
