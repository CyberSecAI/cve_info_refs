Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Hawtio console in Red Hat JBoss A-MQ not setting the `HTTPOnly` and `Secure` attributes on cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing `HTTPOnly` Attribute:** The absence of the `HTTPOnly` attribute allows client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) to access the cookie.
*   **Missing `Secure` Attribute:** The lack of the `Secure` attribute means the cookie can be transmitted over non-HTTPS connections, making it vulnerable to interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially retrieve an authenticated user's SessionID.
*   With the stolen SessionID, an attacker could conduct further attacks with the same permissions as the authenticated user, gaining unauthorized access and potentially compromising the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into a webpage to steal the cookies.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** If the `Secure` attribute is missing, an attacker could intercept the cookie during transmission over an insecure (non-HTTPS) connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or execute malicious scripts within the user's browser context to leverage the missing `HTTPOnly` attribute.
*   **Network Sniffing (if `Secure` attribute is missing):**  The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic if the `Secure` attribute is missing and the user is on an insecure connection.
*   **Access to the Hawtio console:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Hawtio console of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Naftali Rosenbaum of Comsec Consulting.
*   The vulnerability affects Red Hat AMQ, but not Apache ActiveMQ.
*   The issue was addressed in Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3 R9.
*   The fix involves ensuring the `HTTPOnly` and `Secure` attributes are set on cookies to mitigate the described risks.
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity by Red Hat.
