Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2015-5663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   WinRAR uses unsafe methods to determine how to load executable files. Specifically, when a user attempts to execute a file without a file extension, WinRAR may instead execute a file with the same name but with a file extension from the same directory.
*   WinRAR's registry save/restore functionality is also vulnerable. When saving or restoring registry settings, if an executable file (e.g., REGEDIT.BAT) is present in the displayed directory, WinRAR executes that file instead of the intended Windows registry editor (regedit.exe).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Loading:** WinRAR doesn't properly handle files without extensions, potentially executing unintended files.
*   **Insecure Registry Functionality:** When saving or restoring registry settings, WinRAR doesn't verify if the targeted file is an expected executable, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can trick a user into executing a malicious file.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker's code will execute with the same privileges as WinRAR.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker convinces a user to open a file without an extension through WinRAR.
*   **File Manipulation:** An attacker places a malicious executable (e.g., REGEDIT.BAT) in a folder the user interacts with through WinRAR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to either trick the user into opening a specifically crafted file or place a malicious file in a directory that WinRAR displays when saving or restoring registry settings.
*   No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in WinRAR 5.30 beta 4 and earlier (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions).
*   The vulnerability is addressed in WinRAR 5.30 beta 5.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) - High
*   **CVSS v2:** 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) - Medium
