##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

      'Name'           => "Atlassian HipChat for Jira Plugin Velocity Template Injection",
      'Description'    => %q{
        Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available
        for Jira that allows team collibration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java
        code into a Velocity template, and gain code exeuction as Jira. Authentication is required
        to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't
        protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform,
        but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows).

        HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions
        between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with
        a vulnerable copy of HipChat.

        When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module
        will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to
        passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled
        with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable.

        This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Customers who have installed the HipChat For JIRA plugin in JIRA, and are running a version of the plugin equal to or above 1.3.2 and less than 6.30.0** should either update those instances of the **HipChat For JIRA plugin** or their **JIRA** installations to fix this vulnerability.

### **Velocity Template Injection Vulnerability**

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank a severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

We internally discovered that the **HipChat For JIRA plugin** had a resource that combined user input into a velocity template source and subsequently rendered it. Authenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that have a vulnerable version of the HipChat For JIRA plugin enabled. To exploit this issue attackers need to be able to access the JIRA web interface and log into JIRA.

All versions of **HipChat For JIRA plugin** from 1.3.2 before 6.30.0 are affected by this vulnerability.

All versions of **JIRA** from 6.3.5 before 6.4.11 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:

# Atlassian HipChat for Jira Plugin Velocity Template Injection

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Atlassian HipChat for Jira Plugin Velocity Template Injection

Disclosed
10/28/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available
for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java
code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required
to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't
protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform,
but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows).
HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions
between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with
a vulnerable copy of HipChat.
When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module
will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to
passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled
with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable.
This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/multi/http/jira_hipchat_template
msf exploit(jira_hipchat_template) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(jira_hipchat_template) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(jira_hipchat_template) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(jira_hipchat_template) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
