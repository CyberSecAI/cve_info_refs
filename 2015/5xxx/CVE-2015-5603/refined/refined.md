  "CVE-2015-5603": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HipChat for JIRA plugin had a resource that combined user input into a velocity template source and subsequently rendered it.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Velocity Template Injection"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary Java code on systems with vulnerable versions of the HipChat for JIRA plugin enabled, potentially gaining full control of the affected server.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "A specially crafted message sent to a vulnerable HipChat for JIRA plugin instance.",
        "HTTP request to the `/rest/hipchat/integrations/1.0/message/render/` endpoint with a malicious JSON payload"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
         "Must be an authenticated user of the JIRA application",
         "Network access to the JIRA web interface."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HipChat for JIRA plugin processes user-provided messages using a vulnerable Velocity template engine.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Velocity Template Injection",
          "Improper input sanitization"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as the user running JIRA (typically the Tomcat user).",

         "Malicious HTTP POST request to the `/rest/hipchat/integrations/1.0/message/render/` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the exploit.",
