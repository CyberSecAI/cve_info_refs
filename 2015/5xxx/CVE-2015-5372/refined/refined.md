The content is related to CVE-2015-5372.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the SAML 2.0 implementation of nevisAuth when acting as a Service Provider (SP). Specifically, it fails to properly validate the digital signatures of security assertions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass signature validation of security assertions. This is due to a flaw in how nevisAuth handles security assertions conveyed via User-Agent (HTTP POST Binding).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can forge and inject new assertions, impersonating other users. They can modify arbitrary values of the assertion, such as the NameID, and bypass authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves intercepting a valid past authentication process, extracting the signing certificate from the assertion, cloning the certificate, generating a new public/private key pair, inserting the public key into the cloned certificate, using the private key to sign the new certificate, replacing the original signing certificate in the assertion with the rogue copy, modifying the assertion values (e.g., NameID), and signing the modified assertion with the cloned certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic during a valid authentication process. They need the ability to manipulate the SAML assertion data and send a modified assertion to the service provider.
