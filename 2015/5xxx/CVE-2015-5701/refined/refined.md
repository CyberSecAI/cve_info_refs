```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `mktexlsr` script in `texlive-binaries` creates temporary files in `/tmp` using a predictable filename pattern, and does not check for the existence of the file before writing to it, leading to a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure temporary file creation: The script uses a predictable filename pattern (`/tmp/mktexlsrtrees$$.tmp`), making it possible for an attacker to create a file with the same name before the script does.
- TOCTOU race condition: The script does not verify if the temporary file already exists before writing to it.
- Lack of atomic operation: The file creation is not an atomic operation, creating a race condition allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite the temporary file.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary file overwrite: A local attacker could create a symbolic link with the predictable name of the temporary file, which would then be overwritten by the `mktexlsr` script with the privileges of the user running it.
- Sensitive information disclosure: An attacker could potentially read information from the temporary file by creating a regular file at the same location.

Attack vectors:
Local attacker.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user access to the system.
- Ability to create files in `/tmp` with predictable names and create symbolic links with the same name.

Additional details:
- The script was often run as root from cron. This makes the impact of a successful exploit very high.
- The vulnerability was fixed by using `mktemp` to create temporary files with random names and exiting if `mktemp` fails.
- The original fix was reverted due to compatibility problems, and the vulnerability was reintroduced.
