{
  "CVE-2015-5221": {
    "description": "Use-after-free (and double-free) in Jasper JPEG-200",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a double free in the `mif_process_cmpt` function. The function calls `jas_tvparser_destroy` which frees memory, but conditional code branches can lead to a second call of `jas_tvparser_destroy` on the same memory address, resulting in use-after-free and double free.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
        "Double-free"
      ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution if the use-after-free condition can be further exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted JPEG 2000 image file.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file, no further attacker privileges are required."
