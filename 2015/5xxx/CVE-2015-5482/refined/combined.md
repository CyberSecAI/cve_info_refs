## Installation

#### General Requirements

* PHP: 7.4 or newer

#### WordPress Requirements

* WordPress: 5.9 or newer

#### bbPress Requirements

* bbPress Plugin: 2.6.2 or newer

#### Basic Installation

* Plugin folder in the WordPress plugins folder must be `gd-bbpress-attachments`
* Upload folder `gd-bbpress-attachments` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

## FAQ

### Where can I configure the plugin?

Open the Forums menu, and you will see Attachments item there. This will open a panel with global plugin settings.

### Why is Media Library required?

All attachments uploads are handled by the WordPress Media Library, and plugin uses native WordPress upload functions. When the file is uploaded it will be available through Media Library. Consult WordPress documentation about Media Library requirements.

### Sometimes upload fails without any error?

If there is no error to log, it means that PHP during upload has not provided any information about upload, and that upload has failed before reaching WordPress. Usually, this is related to the file size limit in the PHP.

### How can I increase PHP file size limit?

This has to be done on server, in the PHP.INI file (depends on the hosting) with the directive called `upload_max_filesize`. Also, you need to increase `post_max_size` value also. If you allow MAX file size of 32MB, and you want to have 4 files uploaded at once, `upload_max_filesize` has to be 32MB and `post_max_size` has to be 128M or more.

### Does this plugin work with bbPress and BuddyPress groups?

GD bbPress Attachments 4.6 is tested with BuddyPress 10.0 and newer, using bbPress for Groups forums. Make sure you enable JavaScript and CSS Settings Always Include option in the plugin settings.

### What are the common problems that can prevent upload to work?

In some cases, it can happen that jQuery is not included on the page, even so, the bbPress requires it to be loaded. That can happen if something else is unloading jQuery. If the jQuery is not present, the upload will not work.

Another common issue is that WordPress Media Library upload is not working. If that is not set up, attachments upload can’t work.

### Will this plugin work with standalone (non WordPress) bbPress installation?

No. This plugin requires the plugin versions of bbPress 2.6.2 or higher.

Great download plugin with bonuses: thumbnails and editable media library!
It is necessary to write more; it is not obvious, but it can be a decisive factor for the choice!
my recommendations!

## Advisory:

# Local File Include vulnerability in GD bbPress Attachments allows attackers to include arbitrary PHP files

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 1, 2015

An attacker who is an admin can easily include any .php file on the server.

An attacker who can get an admin to follow a link they control will also be able to include that PHP file. It is easy to make these links very convincing.

They could exploit this to attempt to exhaust the server’s resources by including the file that includes the arbitrary file in an infinite loop.

If they’re additionally able to upload arbitrary PHP files (via an admin account or some other vulnerability) they’ll be able to run arbitrary code on the server.

Current state:
 Fixed
