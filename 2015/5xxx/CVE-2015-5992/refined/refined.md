Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-5992:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `form2WlanSetup.cgi` page does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "ssid" parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in the `form2WlanSetup.cgi` page. Specifically, the `ssid` parameter is vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `ssid` parameter. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.  This could result in the attacker performing actions on behalf of the user, stealing cookies, redirecting the user to other sites, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL or web form that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `ssid` parameter when accessing the `form2WlanSetup.cgi` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL or form that includes the malicious script and be able to get a user to visit the crafted link or form. The user must be a user of the router. The user would need to be logged in to the router's admin panel for the attack to have impact.
