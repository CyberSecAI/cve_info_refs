**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling group names within the "Modify Group" feature of the BlackCatCMS administration panel. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize the group name input before rendering it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary Requests:** The attacker can use XSS to make requests to the web server on behalf of the victim user.
- **Malware Download:** XSS can be leveraged to prompt the user to download and install malware.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker can use JavaScript to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Modify Group" feature in the admin panel.
- An attacker needs to create or modify a group with a crafted name containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the administrative panel of BlackCatCMS.
