## Description

[![@aydinnyunus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52822869?u=7295fd2eb2132ef817efea1196a5b3f6a743f543&v=4&size=48)](/aydinnyunus)[aydinnyunus](https://github.com/aydinnyunus)opened [on Apr 19, 2021](https://github.com/BlackCatDevelopment/BlackCatCMS/issues/408#issue-861723285)
## Summary

An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a XSS vulnerability in the "Modify Group" feature in Admin

## Steps to Reproduce:

* Login into the Admin panel
* Go to '/backend/groups/index.php'
* Add group with name '">
* Save group.

## Impact

Cookie Stealing - A malicious user can steal cookies and use them to gain access to the application.

Arbitrary requests - An attacker can use XSS to send requests that appear to be from the victim to the web server.

Malware download - XSS can prompt the user to download malware. Since the prompt looks like a legitimate request from the

site, the user may be more likely to trust the request and actually install the malware.

Defacement - attacker can deface the website using javascript code.
