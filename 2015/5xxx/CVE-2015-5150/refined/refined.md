The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus 7.90, which aligns with CVE-2015-5150, as it is one of the CVEs associated with the described vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability 1: Improper Authentication Disclosing Password**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing user access control mechanisms.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Low privilege users can access sensitive Active Directory integration functionality normally restricted to administrators. This includes retrieving the plain text username and password for the domain account used for Active Directory integration and configuring arbitrary domains for authentication and user import.
*   **Impact:**  A low-privilege user can gain privileged access to the application and potentially the integrated domains, leading to remote access to the organization.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, by exploiting URLs related to Active Directory integration.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Attacker needs a low-privilege account within SupportCenter Plus (can be achieved by registering or stealing an account). Active Directory integration must be configured on the system.

**Vulnerability 2: Directory Traversal on File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of file upload paths allowing for directory traversal.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Low privilege users can manipulate the `module` parameter during file uploads to traverse directories.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential for remote code execution (although limited by missing Java compiler and user ID directory appending).
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Uploading malicious content to web accessible directories.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Remote, via a POST request to /workorder/Attachment.jsp.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Attacker needs a low-privilege account within SupportCenter Plus and the ability to make a POST request to the file upload endpoint.

**Vulnerability 3: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:**  Unsanitized user input reflected back in the response.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in various parameters (`query`, `compAcct`, `redirectTo`).
*   **Impact:**
    *   For the `query` parameter: Only administrators are vulnerable.
    *   For `compAcct` and `redirectTo` parameters: All authenticated users are vulnerable.
    *   Malicious JavaScript can be executed within the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, by crafting malicious URLs containing the XSS payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user account on the system.
