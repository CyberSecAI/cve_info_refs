Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5602:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided text from the Debian Security Advisory DSA-3440-1 directly references **CVE-2015-5602** and describes a vulnerability in `sudoedit`.
*   The exploit-db entry also mentions the same CVE ID and the vulnerable software `sudo` version.
*   The Oracle Security Bulletin notes that CVE-2015-5602 exists in their component "Sudo".
    Therefore, the analyzed content is relevant to CVE-2015-5602.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from improper handling of wildcards in the `sudoers` configuration when used with `sudoedit`. Specifically, when wildcards like `/home/*/*/test.txt` are used, `sudoedit` does not correctly validate the full path, leading to a symlink attack.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Improper validation of paths with wildcards in `sudoedit`.
    *   `sudoedit` allows editing of files in a directory that the user can write to.
    *   `sudoedit` allows editing a file through symlinks located in a writeable directory.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker can bypass authorization and edit arbitrary files. This can lead to privilege escalation as demonstrated by access to `/etc/shadow` or other configuration files.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local attacker who has the ability to create symlinks in a writable directory.
    *   The attacker needs a `sudoers` rule to allow editing of files via `sudoedit`, which can have a wildcard pattern in the path, pointing to the writable directory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   A regular user account on the target system.
    *   A sudoers rule that grants the user `sudoedit` access to files in a directory that contains or is resolved via symlinks.
    *   Ability to create and manipulate symbolic links in the writable directory.
*  **Technical details:**
    *  The flaw occurs when a sudoers entry uses wildcards with `sudoedit`, e.g., `myuser ALL=(root) /home/*/file.txt`. A user can create a symlink in their home directory, e.g., `ln -s /etc/shadow /home/myuser/newdir/test.txt` and then edit the file using sudoedit (`sudoedit /home/myuser/newdir/test.txt`) thus gaining root access to `/etc/shadow`, bypassing the intended access restrictions.
    * Sudo's developers mentioned they now avoid editing of a file in a writable directory that a user can write to and avoid following symlinks in a directory the user can write to (although this can be disabled.)

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is primarily a local privilege escalation issue.
*   The root cause is a logic error in the path validation within `sudoedit`.
*   The fix involves changing sudo behavior so that arbitrary file access is not allowed using `sudoedit` if the user has write access to the directory containing the target file or the symlink in that directory.
