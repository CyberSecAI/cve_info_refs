Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient server-side validation of the Google OAuth authentication token by the Google Login plugin for Jenkins. The plugin relied solely on the `hd` parameter in the initial client-side redirect to Google's OAuth page to enforce domain restrictions. This parameter was easily modifiable by an attacker through an intercepting proxy. The plugin failed to verify the domain of the authenticated user after the token was returned from Google.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Client-Side Domain Restriction:** The domain restriction was primarily enforced through the `hd` parameter in the Google OAuth URL, which is controlled by the client and can be easily manipulated.
*   **Missing Server-Side Validation:** The plugin did not perform server-side verification of the user's domain after receiving the authentication token from Google. It relied only on the token signature for verification.
*   **Trust of Client-Provided Data:**  The plugin improperly trusted the client-provided information (the redirect URL with the `hd` parameter) instead of performing its own validation based on the token content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** A malicious, anonymous user could bypass domain restrictions set up for the Jenkins instance. This allowed them to authenticate successfully using any Google account, even those outside of the intended domain.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once authenticated, the level of access granted to the attacker depends on the Jenkins instance's role and permission configuration, specifically to the *authenticated* group. In the tested instance, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to achieve admin level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack can be performed over the network by intercepting the redirect from the Jenkins instance to Google's OAuth page.
*   **Request Modification:** The attacker modifies the redirect URL to Google's OAuth page, specifically removing or changing the `hd` parameter, using an intercepting proxy like Burp Suite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker requires the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a proxy tool.
*   **Google Account:** The attacker needs a Google account to authenticate with after modifying the `hd` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the Google Login plugin.
*   The fix involved server-side verification of the domain from the user's token and ensure it matches the intended domain.
*   The severity of the vulnerability was rated as medium due to the fact that post-authentication access depends on the particular Jenkins configuration.
