**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in Joomla! CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF checks allowed for potentially uploading malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially upload malicious code to the affected Joomla! system through a CSRF attack.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker needs to find a way to trick a logged-in user into executing this request. This could be via a malicious link, image, or other methods of socially engineering a logged-in user.
- The attacker does not need to be directly authenticated with the web application. The attack depends on the user's active, valid session.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable requests.

**Additional details:**
