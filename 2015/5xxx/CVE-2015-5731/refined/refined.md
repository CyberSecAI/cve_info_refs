Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WordPress handles post locks. An attacker could exploit this to prevent legitimate users from editing a post by holding the lock indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Locking Mechanism:** The system allowed a user to acquire a post lock without proper mechanisms to ensure its release, potentially leading to a denial of service for other users.
*   **Lack of Nonce Verification:** Initially, the "take over" action for post locks did not verify a nonce, making it susceptible to CSRF-like attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can prevent other users from editing a post by locking it and not releasing the lock, effectively denying access to the content.
*   **Content Control:** By locking posts, an attacker could potentially interfere with site content updates.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request:** An attacker could directly send a request with the `get-post-lock` parameter to lock a post and prevent legitimate users from editing.
*  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Without nonce verification, an attacker could trick an authenticated user into taking over the post lock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (Initially):** The attacker initially needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to view and edit posts.
*   **Access to Post ID:** The attacker must have knowledge of the post ID they wish to lock.
*   **Ability to Generate Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to generate requests to the WordPress site, using either crafted links or through CSRF attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability introduced a nonce check for the "take over" action. This ensures that the lock is only obtained when a user intends to take over.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in WordPress version 4.2.4 and later.
*   The changesets [33542](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33542) and [33543](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33543) address this vulnerability by adding the nonce verification.
*   The Debian security advisory [DSA-3332-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3332) and [DSA-3383-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3383) also mention CVE-2015-5731 as a resolved issue.
