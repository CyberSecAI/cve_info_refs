Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ANA App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient SSL Certificate Validation:** The application does not perform adequate checks on the SSL certificates presented by servers it connects to. This could be due to various issues like not verifying the certificate chain, not checking for valid dates, or not validating the hostname against the certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the app and the server can intercept and decrypt the communication by presenting a fake certificate.
*   **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the encrypted communication, potentially gaining access to sensitive information transmitted between the app and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is conducted over a network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim or be able to intercept network traffic destined for the targeted server. This could be achieved by setting up a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot or through ARP poisoning on a shared network.
*   **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to act as a "man-in-the-middle", intercepting and modifying network traffic, and presenting their own malicious certificate.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects both Android (version 3.1.1 and earlier) and iOS (version 3.3.6 and earlier) versions of the ANA App.
*   The vulnerability was reported by AOKI Keiichi and coordinated with the developer by JPCERT/CC under Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
*   The CVSS v2 base score for this vulnerability is 4.0, with network access, high complexity, and no authentication required. The impact is partial for both confidentiality and integrity, and none for availability
