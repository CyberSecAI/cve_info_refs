- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the symbolic linking mechanism of afc.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a flaw in how Apple File Conduit (afc) handles symbolic links.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A maliciously crafted afc command may allow access to protected parts of the filesystem. This could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions and potentially gain access to sensitive information or modify system files.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a maliciously crafted afc command. The attacker would need to be able to execute or inject such a command, possibly through a compromised application or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious afc command on a vulnerable device. This might involve local access, a malicious app, or some other form of code execution on the target device.
