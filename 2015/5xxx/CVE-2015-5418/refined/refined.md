- Remote code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. The code would run in the context of the process handling the malicious GIF.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted GIF image.
- User interaction required: The user has to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
- Ability to craft a malicious GIF file: The attacker needs the technical knowledge to craft a GIF file that triggers the buffer overflow.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to a user, either via a malicious website or directly via email/file sharing.

**Additional Details:**
- Hewlett-Packard released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-05-19, and the coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2015-08-24
