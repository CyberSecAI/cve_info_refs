Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that Ipsilon does not escape HTML when processing HTTP(S) request responses. This allows for the injection of JavaScript code into Python exception message templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper HTML escaping in the processing of HTTP(S) request responses, which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the use of Python templates where user-provided input is not sanitized before being included in the output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to an XSS attack. This could result in:

*   **Client-side attacks:** Execution of arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Data theft:** Access to sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other user data.
*   **Session hijacking:** Taking over user sessions and performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP(S) request that triggers a specific type of exception, injecting malicious JavaScript code through unsanitized response data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker does not need any special privileges or access; it can be performed by any remote, unauthorized attacker who can send HTTP(S) requests to the vulnerable Ipsilon server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Ipsilon versions 0.1.0 to 1.0.0
- It was fixed in versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.0 by enabling auto-escaping of templates.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Scherer of Red Hat.
- The upstream patch is available at: `https://pagure.io/ipsilon/a503aa9c2a30a74e709d1c88099befd50fb2eb16`.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry: `https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1255170`
- The vulnerability is described as an XSS vulnerability due to exception handling.
