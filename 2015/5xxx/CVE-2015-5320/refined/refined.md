{
  "CVE-2015-5320": {
    "Description": "JNLP slave connections did not verify that the correct secret was supplied, which allowed malicious users to connect their own machines as slaves to Jenkins knowing only the name of the slave. This enables attackers to take over Jenkins (unless the slave-to-master security subsystem is enabled) or gain access to private data like keys and source code.",
    "Root cause": "The Jenkins JNLP slave connection mechanism does not properly verify the secret key provided during connection establishment.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure JNLP agent connection",
      "Missing secret key verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows attackers to take over Jenkins or gain access to private data like keys and source code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access to the Jenkins master"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Knowledge of the name of a configured Jenkins agent.",
      "Ability to connect to the Jenkins master via JNLP."
     ]
  }
