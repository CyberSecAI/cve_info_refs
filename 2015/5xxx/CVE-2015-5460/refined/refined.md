      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The provided content is a commit diff that fixes an XSS vulnerability by sanitizing the output of classification names in `app/views/events/_menu.html.erb`.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application that would be executed when a user views the affected pages. This could lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user and other security issues.",
        "attackVectors": "The attack vector is through the application's web interface. An attacker can inject malicious scripts by crafting a classification name that will be displayed in the event menu.",

        "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input when adding threat classifications. Specifically, the output from the `snorby/app/views/events/_menu.html.erb` file is not sanitized before being rendered, allowing injected scripts to execute.",

          "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"

        "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application by creating a malicious classification. When a user views the event menu, this script will execute in their browser. This could result in the attacker potentially stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing other actions on behalf of the user.",
        "attackVectors": "The attack vector is through the web application's interface, specifically when adding a new threat classification. The XSS is triggered when the classification name is rendered in the event menu.",

        "weaknesses": [
          "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious script into classification names, which, when rendered on the page, will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.",
        "attackVectors": "The attack vector is via the web UI. An attacker can add a classification with a malicious script in the title. This script will then be executed when a user views the 'My Queue' page.",
