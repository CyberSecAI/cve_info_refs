## Description

[![@0x27](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9094330?u=74664183ce30ab603b2bd669643b925e3056c5c3&v=4&size=48)](/0x27)[0x27](https://github.com/0x27)opened [on Aug 5, 2015](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/issues/333#issue-99280448)

[The Post-Auth RCE](https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/suiteshell) allegedly "fixed" in [Commit b1b3fd6](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/commit/b1b3fd61c7697ad2073cd253d31c9462929e7bb5) is not fixed.

The fix simply makes the bug slightly harder to exploit, turning it from a straight-shot file upload bug into a lovely race condition. Also, I bypassed the blacklist again :)

Video Proof below, a PoC will be published along with a full writeup of the vulnerability in due course, and [a CVE is being requested from MITRE (or whoever decides to issue them...).](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/296)

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/365e808f23059f18dd53906de4d3d10745aeef50d2b749f493d067ef5f9dd102/687474703a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f654856496735656f594e632f302e6a7067)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHVIg5eoYNc)

Suggested fix: Validate images BEFORE writing to disc. Writing them to disc, then checking them, is a bad idea.

[Also, you were told on the commit this was a bad idea. Are we going to have to play remote-code-execution whack a mole for another while?](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/commit/b1b3fd61c7697ad2073cd253d31c9462929e7bb5#commitcomment-11281062) Seriously, as a Crown Commercial Services Supplier, your QA process should surely have caught this.

Alternate fix for [#251](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/pull/251). As mentioned in the PR we also want to add whitelisting rather than blacklisting.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Do note, this fix could lead to the file being there for a short period of time leading to a race condition wherin the attacker simply has to beat the unlink to the punch and spawn a reverse shell/drop further malicious files/whatever.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Use CVE-2015-5946 for the original incomplete blacklist vulnerability
in which an authenticated attacker could, at any time, upload an
executable file (such as a phtml file) to a location from which the
web server serves files.

The blacklist was:

        'php', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5', 'pl', 'cgi', 'py',
        'asp', 'cfm', 'js', 'vbs', 'html', 'htm'

Use CVE-2015-5947 for the other original issue in which the:

  if(!verify_uploaded_image

code block does not attempt to restrict access after an "unverified"
file is detected. CVE-2015-5946 and CVE-2015-5947 seem to be
independently relevant, although possibly that depends on the "Found
{$m[0]} in $path, not allowing upload" code.

Use CVE-2015-5948 for the race condition that exists because of the
incomplete fix for CVE-2015-5947.

> vulnerability in

There is no CVE ID specifically for the concept of using blacklisting
rather than whitelisting. In practice, a large blacklist can be
constructed that results in a negligible chance that an allowed file
would be executable on a customer system with a realistic
configuration. This may be considered an unrecommended or overly risky
design, but the issue is not included in CVE.

> its
> "check for valid image" test leaves uploaded files in a tempdir that
> is web accessible.

There is no CVE ID specifically for the concept of using a temporary
directory that is web accessible. The same directory could be used,
without the race condition, in a number of ways -- possibly including
