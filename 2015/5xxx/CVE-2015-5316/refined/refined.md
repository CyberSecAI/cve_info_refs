Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the EAP-pwd (Password-Authenticated Key Exchange) peer implementation within `wpa_supplicant`. Specifically, when an EAP-pwd Confirm message is unexpectedly received *before* the Identity exchange phase of the protocol, the error handling path incorrectly dereferences a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference within the error handling code. When an unexpected Confirm message is received, the program attempts to access memory through a pointer that hasn't been properly initialized, resulting in a crash.
*   **Improper Error Handling:**  The error path within the EAP-pwd implementation was not robust enough to handle the reception of a Confirm message before the Identity message, indicating a flaw in the protocol state machine or handling of unexpected messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service attack. By sending a specially crafted EAP-pwd Confirm message at the wrong time, an attacker can cause the vulnerable `wpa_supplicant` process to terminate, thus disrupting Wi-Fi connectivity for the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, over-the-air attack:** An attacker within radio range of a vulnerable device can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **EAP-pwd enabled:** The vulnerability is only applicable when EAP-pwd is enabled in a network configuration profile on the target device.
*   **Specifically crafted Confirm Message:** The attack requires the attacker to send a malicious EAP-pwd Confirm message before the Identity message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Radio Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of the targeted device to send the malicious wireless message.
*   **Basic Wireless knowledge:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of Wi-Fi and how EAP-pwd works.
*   **Capability to send wireless frames:**  The attacker needs to be able to inject wireless frames, which can be achieved using readily available tools.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to `wpa_supplicant` versions 2.3 through 2.5 when compiled with `CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y`.
*   The fix involves correcting the error handling in the EAP-pwd peer implementation to avoid the NULL pointer dereference.
*   Mitigation includes patching or upgrading `wpa_supplicant`, disabling EAP-pwd in the build configuration or at runtime.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Ubuntu 15.10, other distributions may be affected differently.
