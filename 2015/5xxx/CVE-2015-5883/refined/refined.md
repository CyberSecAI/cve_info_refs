- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Terminal application did not handle bidirectional override characters consistently between displaying and selecting text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inconsistent handling of bidirectional override characters in Terminal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Maliciously crafted text could mislead the user in Terminal. An attacker could use this to potentially trick the user into executing malicious commands by displaying them differently than they are actually interpreted.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted text displayed in the Terminal application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to display text within a Terminal window.
