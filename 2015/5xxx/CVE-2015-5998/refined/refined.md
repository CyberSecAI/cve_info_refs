Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authentication mechanisms in Impero Education Pro classroom management software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** The authentication process relies on sending a fixed message ("-1|AUTHENTICATE\x02PASSWORD"). This message can be easily spoofed by an attacker once the encryption method is known.
-   The use of a hardcoded key and IV (related to CVE-2015-5997) allows an attacker to decrypt the traffic, allowing them to further leverage this authentication weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.
-  After successful authentication, the attacker can execute arbitrary Impero commands on the targeted machine.
-  The attacker can potentially run programs with SYSTEM privileges, leading to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network attack.
-  The attacker needs to know the fixed message for authentication and the encryption method (which is vulnerable through CVE-2015-5997).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the machine running the vulnerable Impero software.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the custom encryption protocol (details in CVE-2015-5997) to decrypt and forge authentication messages.
