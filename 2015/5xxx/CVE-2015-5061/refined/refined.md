{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation allows a malicious payload to be stored in the 'vendor name' field.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The stored XSS payload is executed when other authenticated users view the affected vendor's edit page or contracts associated with it.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "entry_point": "POST request to `/VendorDef.do` when creating a new vendor. The XSS payload is injected into the `organizationName` parameter.",
      "execution_points": [
        "Visiting the edit page for the malicious vendor (`/VendorDef.do?mode=edit&id=3`).",
        "Visiting a contract view page associated with the malicious vendor (`/ContractDef.do?contractID=1`)."
       ]
    },
     "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user with permissions to add new vendors is required to inject the malicious payload. Low user interaction is required for exploitation."
