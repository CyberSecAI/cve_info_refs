Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5310:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the processing of WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) Sleep Mode Response frames within wpa_supplicant. Specifically, the software failed to verify if management frame protection (MFP), also known as PMF, was enabled for the association before accepting updated Group Temporal Keys (GTK) from the frame. This mechanism was not designed to be used without management frame protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper validation of management frame protection (MFP/PMF) before accepting updated GTK keys.
- Acceptance of unauthenticated GTK updates via injected WNM Sleep Mode Response frames when MFP is not enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Broadcast/multicast packet injection: An attacker can inject malicious broadcast/multicast packets using a modified GTK.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can replace the legitimate GTK, preventing the acceptance of authorized broadcast/multicast packets, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injected WNM Sleep Mode Response frames from an attacker within radio range of the vulnerable station.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within radio range of the vulnerable wpa_supplicant device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send wireless frames, and inject a crafted WNM Sleep Mode Response frame.
- The vulnerable device must be configured with `CONFIG_WNM=y` and be using a driver that sends WNM action frames to userspace.
- The wireless association must be using RSN (WPA2-Personal or WPA2-Enterprise) but without management frame protection (MFP) enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects wpa_supplicant versions 2.0 to 2.5.
- The fix involves ignoring Key Data in the WNM Sleep Mode Response frame if PMF is not in use.
- Mitigation steps include patching wpa_supplicant, upgrading to version 2.6 or newer, enabling management frame protection, or disabling WNM functionality.
- The vulnerability is rated as Moderate severity in the Android Security Bulletin, but can lead to a denial of service.
