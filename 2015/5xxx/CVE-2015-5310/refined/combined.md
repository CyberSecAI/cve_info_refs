Subject: wpa_supplicant unauthorized WNM Sleep Mode GTK control

wpa_supplicant unauthorized WNM Sleep Mode GTK control

Published: November 10, 2015
Identifier: CVE-2015-5310
Latest version available from: <http://w1.fi/security/2015-6/>

Vulnerability

A vulnerability in wpa_supplicant was found in WMM Sleep Mode Response
frame processing in a case where the association uses RSN (WPA2-Personal
or WPA2-Enterprise), but does not use management frame protection (MFP,
also known as PMF = protected management frames). This WNM Sleep Mode
mechanism was not designed to be used without management frame
protection, but there was no explicit check for that in wpa_supplicant.

wpa_supplicant accepted the updated GTK keys from this frame regardless
of whether management frame protection was negotiated for the
association. This may result in an unauthenticated, injected frame being
able to replace the GTK (the key used to protected broadcast and
multicast Data frames).

This vulnerability can be used to perform broadcast/multicast packet
injection and denial of service (prevent authorized broadcast/multicast
packets from being accepted) attacks by an attacker that is within radio
range of the station devices.

Vulnerable versions/configurations

wpa_supplicant v2.0-v2.5 with CONFIG_WNM=y the build configuration
(wpa_supplicant/.config) and a driver that sends WNM Action frames to
user space for processing. For example, most cfg80211/mac80211-based
drivers do this. However, some drivers do not seem to send the WNM Sleep
Mode Response frame to user space even though they are reporting some
other WNM Action frames. When wpa_supplicant is used with such a driver,
it may not be possible to trigger this vulnerability.

Possible mitigation steps

- Merge the following commit and rebuild hostapd/wpa_supplicant:

  WNM: Ignore Key Data in WNM Sleep Mode Response frame if no PMF in use

  This patch is available from <http://w1.fi/security/2015-6/>
  (two different versions; one matching the exact hostap.git and another
  one for older snapshot prior to the unrelated changes in the file; the
  latter can be used to fix older wpa_supplicant versions).

- Update to wpa_supplicant v2.6 or newer, once available.

- Enable management frame protection in the AP and station configuration
  ("ieee80211w=2" in wpa_supplicant network profile).

- wpa_supplicant: Disable CONFIG_WNM=y in the build configuration
  (wpa_supplicant/.config) (i.e., remove the line or comment it out);
  note: this will disable all WNM functionality, so this mitigation option
  may not be appropriate for number of use cases.

# Nexus Security Bulletin—January 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 04, 2016 | Updated April 28, 2016*

We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Builds LMY49F or later and Android 6.0 with Security Patch Level of January
1, 2016 or later address these issues. Refer to the [Common Questions and Answers](#common_questions_and_answers) section for more details.

Partners were notified about and provided updates for the issues described in
this bulletin on December 7, 2015 or earlier. Where applicable, source code
patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

## Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

## Security Vulnerability Details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2016-01-01 patch level.
There is a description of the issue, a severity rationale, and a table
with the CVE, associated bug, severity, updated versions, and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP change that addressed the issue to the
bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP
references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Mediaserver

During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps cannot normally access.

### Attack Surface Reduction for Nexus Kernels

SysV IPC is not supported in any Android Kernel. We have removed this from the
OS as it exposes additional attack surface that doesn’t add functionality to
the system that could be exploited by malicious applications. Also, System V
IPCs are not compliant with Android's application lifecycle because the
allocated resources are not freeable by the memory manager leading to global
kernel resource leakage. This change addresses issue such as CVE-2015-7613.

=== Content from w1.fi_0aea1903_20250125_010337.html ===
wpa\_supplicant unauthorized WNM Sleep Mode GTK control
Published: November 10, 2015
Identifier: CVE-2015-5310
Latest version available from: http://w1.fi/security/2015-6/
Vulnerability
A vulnerability in wpa\_supplicant was found in WMM Sleep Mode Response
frame processing in a case where the association uses RSN (WPA2-Personal
or WPA2-Enterprise), but does not use management frame protection (MFP,
also known as PMF = protected management frames). This WNM Sleep Mode
mechanism was not designed to be used without management frame
protection, but there was no explicit check for that in wpa\_supplicant.
wpa\_supplicant accepted the updated GTK keys from this frame regardless
of whether management frame protection was negotiated for the
association. This may result in an unauthenticated, injected frame being
able to replace the GTK (the key used to protected broadcast and
multicast Data frames).
This vulnerability can be used to perform broadcast/multicast packet
injection and denial of service (prevent authorized broadcast/multicast
packets from being accepted) attacks by an attacker that is within radio
range of the station devices.
Vulnerable versions/configurations
wpa\_supplicant v2.0-v2.5 with CONFIG\_WNM=y the build configuration
(wpa\_supplicant/.config) and a driver that sends WNM Action frames to
user space for processing. For example, most cfg80211/mac80211-based
drivers do this. However, some drivers do not seem to send the WNM Sleep
Mode Response frame to user space even though they are reporting some
other WNM Action frames. When wpa\_supplicant is used with such a driver,
it may not be possible to trigger this vulnerability.
Possible mitigation steps
- Merge the following commit and rebuild hostapd/wpa\_supplicant:
WNM: Ignore Key Data in WNM Sleep Mode Response frame if no PMF in use
This patch is available from http://w1.fi/security/2015-6/
(two different versions; one matching the exact hostap.git and another
one for older snapshot prior to the unrelated changes in the file; the
latter can be used to fix older wpa\_supplicant versions).
- Update to wpa\_supplicant v2.6 or newer, once available.
- Enable management frame protection in the AP and station configuration
("ieee80211w=2" in wpa\_supplicant network profile).
- wpa\_supplicant: Disable CONFIG\_WNM=y in the build configuration
(wpa\_supplicant/.config) (i.e., remove the line or comment it out);
note: this will disable all WNM functionality, so this mitigation option
may not be appropriate for number of use cases.
