  "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.232 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.508 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.199, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.199, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.199 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5127, CVE-2015-5134, CVE-2015-5539, CVE-2015-5540, CVE-2015-5550, CVE-2015-5551, CVE-2015-5556, CVE-2015-5557, CVE-2015-5559, CVE-2015-5561, CVE-2015-5563, CVE-2015-5564, and CVE-2015-5565.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs when setting the scrollRect attribute of a MovieClip in ActionScript 2 (AS2) with a custom Rectangle object. Specifically, it's possible to free the MovieClip while a reference to it remains in the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Flash Player plugin. This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves a specially crafted SWF file that sets the `scrollRect` attribute of a `MovieClip` with a custom `Rectangle`, and then frees the `MovieClip` object."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious SWF file and deliver it to a victim. The victim must then load the SWF file in a vulnerable Flash Player environment. The attacker does not need any specific capabilities other than being able to deliver the file to the user."
