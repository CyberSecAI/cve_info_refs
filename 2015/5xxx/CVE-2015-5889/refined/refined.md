Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure usage of the `execv()` function in the `/usr/bin/rsh` binary on Mac OS X. Specifically, when `/usr/bin/rsh` is called with only a host argument, it invokes `/usr/bin/rlogin` without dropping privileges or clearing the environment. This allows environment variables, including ones used by `libmalloc`, to persist and be used by `rlogin`.
- `libmalloc` uses environment variables such as `MallocLogFile` for logging and does not permanently clear the environment like `libdyld`.
- The `issetugid(2)` system call, used to determine if certain environment variables are safe to use, returns 0 when a setuid binary launches another process without dropping privileges, even if the process context is still tainted by unsafe environment variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure environment variable handling:** `rsh` doesn't properly sanitize its environment when launching `rlogin`, allowing an attacker-controlled environment to be passed to `rlogin`.
- **`libmalloc` unsafe environment variable usage:** `libmalloc` reads configuration from environment variables, specifically `MallocLogFile` and `MallocStackLoggingDirectory`, without sufficient sanitization when run under a setuid context via `rsh` and `rlogin`.
- **Insufficient privilege dropping:** The `rsh` binary, a setuid-root binary, doesn't drop privileges or sanitize the environment before calling `rlogin`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local privilege escalation to root:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an unprivileged local user can gain root privileges.
- **Arbitrary file creation with controlled content:** The attacker can create a root-owned file with attacker-controlled content by manipulating the `MallocLogFile` and `MallocStackLoggingDirectory` environment variables through the vulnerable `rsh` binary.
- **Modifying sudoers file:** The provided exploit modifies the `/etc/sudoers` file to allow passwordless `sudo` access for all users, effectively granting root access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands locally on the vulnerable system.
- **Manipulation of environment variables:** The attacker sets specific `libmalloc` related environment variables (`MallocLogFile` and `MallocStackLoggingDirectory`) to achieve arbitrary file creation.
- **Execution of `/usr/bin/rsh`:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing the setuid-root binary `/usr/bin/rsh`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local user access:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the target system.
- **Ability to execute programs:** The attacker must be able to execute programs, including `/usr/bin/rsh`.
- **Basic shell access:** An interactive shell or command execution capability is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in OS X El Capitan (10.11), and it affects OS X versions 10.9.5 and 10.10.5.
- The exploit leverages the ability of libmalloc to log memory allocation information to an attacker-specified file, in this case, the /etc/crontab file. This file is then used to append a line to the sudoers file to gain root access.
- A Metasploit module (as included in the provided content) was created to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
