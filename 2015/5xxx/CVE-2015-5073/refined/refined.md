{
  "CVE-2015-5073": {
    "Description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way PCRE handled malformed regular expressions. An attacker able to make MariaDB execute an SQL query with a specially crafted regular expression could use these flaws to cause it to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking in the `find_fixedlength()` function of the PCRE library when handling malformed regular expressions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (crash)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By making MariaDB execute an SQL query with a specially crafted regular expression.",
          "Sending a specially-crafted regular expression to a service using PCRE."

    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to influence the regular expression processed by PCRE",
        "Ability to make MariaDB execute an SQL query with a crafted regular expression",
          "Remote attacker"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted regular expression containing a forward reference within a backward assertion with an excess closing parenthesis"
  }
