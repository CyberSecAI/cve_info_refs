Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause was a logic error in the `usb_storage.js` file within the Gaia system app of Firefox OS. This file was responsible for handling USB Mass Storage (UMS) mounting. The logic error caused the system to expose USB media volumes to USB hosts even when the device was locked with a passcode. This could happen after a reboot or after certain screen saver state changes. The `usb_storage.js` logic was flawed in how it determined whether USB storage should be enabled based on the lockscreen state. It was not correctly using the lockscreen state to prevent access to the USB storage. The issue was introduced when the file was rewritten.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper access control for USB storage when the device was locked. The system failed to prevent USB media volumes from being mounted and accessible while the device was locked with a passcode.
-   **Flawed Logic in `usb_storage.js`:** The JavaScript code responsible for managing USB storage had incorrect logic. It did not properly take into account the lock screen state before enabling USB sharing. It also treated MTP and UMS differently which was not intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the device's internal storage and potentially sensitive data. By simply rebooting the device and connecting it via USB, the attacker could mount and access storage even with a passcode enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector was physical access to the device. An attacker needs physical access to the device to be able to reboot it and connect it via USB.
-   **Reboot:** The vulnerability can be triggered by rebooting the device.
-   **Screen Saver State:** Certain screen saver state changes could also expose the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Physical access to the device.**
-   **Ability to reboot the device.**
-   **Basic understanding of how to connect and access USB storage from a computer.**

**Additional Details:**

-   The bug report provides more detail than the CVE description, including specific STR (steps to reproduce), code analysis of the flawed logic, and details about interactions with ADB.
-   The issue affects Firefox OS versions 2.1 and 2.2, and was fixed in versions 2.1, 2.1S, 2.2 and master.
-   The fix involved reverting the `usb_storage.js` logic back to use the service's locked state and the lockscreen app events for managing USB storage access.
-   The vulnerability was rated as "sec-high" and a security bounty was awarded.

**Summary**

The core issue was an improper implementation of access control in Firefox OS's USB mass storage handling. The flawed logic in `usb_storage.js` allowed for unauthorized access to a locked device's storage through the USB interface, creating a significant security risk.
