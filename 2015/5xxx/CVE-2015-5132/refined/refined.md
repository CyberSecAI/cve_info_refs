  "CVE-2015-5132": {
    "description": "Buffer overflow in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.232 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.508 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.199, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.199, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.199 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5131 and CVE-2015-5133.",
    "affected_software": [
      "Adobe Flash Player",
      "Adobe AIR",
      "Adobe AIR SDK",
      "Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow caused by an overly large index value relative to a dynamically allocated buffer. The root cause lies in how Flash Player handles certain SWF content and its memory management when processing indices.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds memory read",
        "Buffer overflow"
     ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The vulnerability could also lead to application crashes (Denial of Service).",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, where a specially crafted SWF file is loaded by the Flash Player. The method of delivery of the SWF file is unspecified.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious SWF file that triggers the buffer overflow. The attacker would likely need to host this file and lure the victim into loading the SWF via a webpage or other means."
