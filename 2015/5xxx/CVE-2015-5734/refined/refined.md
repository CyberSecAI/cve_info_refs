Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `preview_theme()` function in WordPress, which is used to provide a temporary preview of a theme. This function utilizes output buffering (`ob_start()`) with a callback function, `preview_theme_ob_filter`, which in turn uses `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback` to process links. The vulnerability lies in how `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback` attempts to remove `onclick` attributes from HTML links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Attribute Removal:** The `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback` function attempts to remove `onclick` attributes using a regular expression. However, this removal process is flawed. It inadvertently allows an attacker to inject new attributes into the HTML link tag by crafting a malicious `title` attribute that contains the string `onclick='"` followed by the desired attributes, and then closing the title attribute.
*   **Bypassed XSS Filter:** The flawed logic allows to bypass the intended security filters, enabling the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, which can include event handlers like `onmouseover`, allowing for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page that will be executed when a logged-in administrator previews the theme with the malicious link.
*   **Site Compromise:** Through successful exploitation, an attacker could potentially take control of the administrator's session, leading to full site compromise.
*   **Malicious actions:** An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the admin, such as creating or deleting posts, changing settings, or installing malicious plugins/themes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing specific `$_GET` parameters that, when clicked by an administrator, trigger the vulnerable code path in the `preview_theme()` function.
*   **Crafted HTML:** The attacker injects specially crafted HTML code (e.g. in a comment) containing the malicious link with the payload to be injected, which will be processed by the vulnerable theme preview logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Logged-in Administrator:** The attack requires a logged-in administrator to visit a page containing the malicious code or click on the crafted malicious link while logged in to the WordPress admin panel.
*   **HTML Injection:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML content into a location that will be rendered by WordPress, such as a post comment, so that the injected HTML is rendered in the context of the previewed theme.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is in the `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback` function, specifically in how it handles links.  The function has the following logic:

1.  It tries to remove `onclick` attributes from `<a>` tags.
2.  It checks if the URL in the `href` attribute contains `/wp-admin/`, a URL with `://` that doesn't match the site's home URL, `/feed/`, or `/trackback/`.
3.  If the URL is any of the above it is modified to have `onclick="return false;"` added to the `<a>` tag.
4.  If not it adds preview parameters to the URL to ensure theme preview functionality works, and returns the modified HTML.

The vulnerability lies in the removal of `onclick` attributes. A malicious link like:

`<a href='/wp-admin/' title="onclick='" Title='" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;display:block;" onmouseover=alert(1)//'>Test</a>`

After processing by `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback`, results in:

`<a href='/wp-admin/' title="" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;display:block;" onmouseover=alert(1)//'>Test</a>`

The removal of `onclick='"` leads to the unintended injection of `style` and `onmouseover` attributes.

**Patch:**

The patch removes the vulnerable regex manipulation and returns the original match `$matches[0]` in the `preview_theme_ob_filter_callback` function, effectively disabling the problematic attribute handling and thus preventing the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marc-Alexandre Montpas of Sucuri.
*   The fix was included in WordPress version 4.2.4.
*   The vulnerability is a persistent XSS vulnerability because the injected payload is stored in the database.
