The correct parsing of that sentence is like:

  WordPress 4.2.4 fixes three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
  [a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site
  (CVE-2015-2213)]

not like:

  [WordPress 4.2.4 fixes three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
  a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site]
  (CVE-2015-2213)

See below for the set of 6 CVE IDs that correspond to the currently
available information.

> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33555>
> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33556>

Use CVE-2015-2213 only for this SQL injection issue.

# WordPress 4.2.4 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a**security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by [Marc-Alexandre Montpas](https://sucuri.net/) of Sucuri, [Helen Hou-Sandí](http://helenhousandi.com/) of the WordPress security team, [Netanel Rubin](http://www.checkpoint.com/) of Check Point, and [Ivan Grigorov](https://hackerone.com/reactors08). It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by [Johannes Schmitt](http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/) of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by [Mohamed A. Baset](https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh).

Our thanks to those who have practiced [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/) of security issues.

WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&stop_rev=33396).

[Download WordPress 4.2.4](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.

*Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available ([zip](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip)) and it contains these fixes. For more on 4.3, see [the RC 1 announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-release-candidate/).*

# Persistent XSS Vulnerability in WordPress Explained

**Security Risk:** Dangerous

**Exploitation Level:** Easy

**DREAD Score:** 6/10

**Vulnerability:** Persistent XSS

**Patched Version:** 4.2.4

Last week the WordPress team released a [patch that fixed 6 security vulnerabilities](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/). Of the six, you’ll find one  that we identified a few months back.

**Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:**
 May 6th, 2015 – Initial report to WordPress security team
 May 8th, 2015 – WordPress security team confirming receipt of the report
 July 23th, 2015 – WordPress 4.2.3 released, not fixing the issue
 July 24th, 2015 – WordPress security team confirming it will be fixed on the next security release
 August 4th, 2015 – Patch made public with the release of WordPress 4.2.4

### Technical Details

The bug comes from the **preview\_theme()** function, it is used by WordPress to temporarily preview what a specific theme will look like. It is hooked to the **setup\_theme** action hook, which gets executed every time a theme is to be displayed.

[![The preview_theme() function](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image1.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image1.png)

The preview\_theme() function

As you can see from the above screenshot, if a logged-in administrator visits one of the site’s pages and uses a few additional **$\_GET** parameters (Which can happen, for example, if he clicks on a malicious link beforehand), this function will set **preview\_theme\_ob\_filter** as **ob\_start**‘s callback function.

[![The preview_theme_ob_filter callback function](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image2.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image2.png)

The preview\_theme\_ob\_filter callback function

Once **ob\_start()** has gathered all of the page’s content, it will call **preview\_theme\_ob\_filter()** to grab all HTML links and filter them using the **preview\_theme\_ob\_filter\_callback** function.

[![The preview_theme_ob_filter_callback function](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image3.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image3.png)

The preview\_theme\_ob\_filter\_callback function

Which will, among other things, remove **onclick=”** event handlers from the link tags.

### Where is the Issue?

The problem occurs when **preview\_theme\_ob\_filter\_callback** removes the **onclick=”** handlers as it could be used to actually insert new tag attributes to the HTML link by sending a tag similar to the following in a post comment:

`<a href='/wp-admin/' title="onclick='" Title='" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;display:block;" onmouseover=alert(1)//'>Test</a>`

Where the part in bold is the one that will get removed, accidentally inserting our **style** and **onmouseover** attributes, which will print the following link tag in the administrator’s browser:

`<a href='/wp-admin/' title="" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;display:block;" onmouseover=alert(1)//'>Test</a>`

This bypasses their filters that were in place to disallow javascript from being executed.

### Updates Are Out, Ensure You Don’t Miss Them

If your site supports automatic updates, chances are it’s already been patched. If it’s disabled, you’ll want to manually update at your earliest convenience. We also recommend investing in a technology that can help proactively protect against vulnerabilities like the ones recently patch, something like a [Website Firewall (WAF)](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/stop-website-attacks-and-hacks).

   Problem is wordpress security team is not enough. Before release they should find those bugs or vulnerabilities. But they are not making it because team is not enough. WP Security team must grow.

   So this has to be done by an admin?
