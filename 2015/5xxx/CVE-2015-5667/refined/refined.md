Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content within the `HTML::Scrubber` Perl module when the "comment" function is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The module fails to properly sanitize HTML, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is present when the `comment` function is enabled within the `HTML::Scrubber` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: If an attacker can inject malicious script tags, those scripts will be executed in the user's web browser, potentially leading to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Displaying altered content
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious HTML, including script tags, into the content that is processed by `HTML::Scrubber`. This could be achieved via:
    - User input fields
    - Database storage
    - Other data sources that the application uses to generate HTML

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to introduce unsanitized HTML content that will be processed by the vulnerable `HTML::Scrubber` module with the `comment` function enabled. This typically requires some way to inject data into the application's data flow.

**Affected Products:**
- HTML::Scrubber version 0.14 and earlier.

**Solution:**
- Update to HTML::Scrubber version 0.15 or later, where the vulnerability has been fixed.

**CVSS:**
- CVSS v2: 2.6 (Low) - AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N
