Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how MATCHA INVOICE configures the database during its installation process. This flaw allows for code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The primary vulnerability is code injection, which allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Incorrect Database Configuration:** The underlying issue is related to the handling of database configuration during installation, which introduces the code injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server where MATCHA INVOICE is installed. This can lead to complete control over the web server.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker may gain access to sensitive data stored in the database or server file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the installation process of MATCHA INVOICE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Installer Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the installer of the vulnerable version of MATCHA INVOICE.

**Additional Notes**
- The vendor's advisory mentions a blind SQL injection vulnerability alongside the code injection, which was also fixed in version 2.5.7. This indicates multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the same patch.
- The CVSS score is 5.1 (Medium), with network access, high complexity, no authentication, and partial impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.
