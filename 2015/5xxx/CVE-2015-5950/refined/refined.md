Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how NVIDIA graphics drivers handle specific IOCTL writes. Specifically, a 32-bit integer value stored in the kernel driver is written to a user-specified memory location, without proper sanitization of the memory location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Pointer:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization for the user-specified memory location. This allows a local attacker to write kernel data to an arbitrary memory location, potentially including kernel space.
- **IOCTL Handling:** The NVIDIA drivers incorrectly handle certain IOCTL writes, which allows for the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on the system. This is achieved by writing to a memory location that leads to code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary memory writes within the kernel's address space leading to system instability or denial of service.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The CVSS score indicates a complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This means that an attacker can gain full control of the system, read any data, modify any data, and render the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker who has local access to the system.
- **Specially Crafted IOCTL:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted IOCTL command to the NVIDIA graphics driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target machine, without requiring any initial privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of how to craft the malicious IOCTL command that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Interact with NVIDIA Driver:** The attacker must be able to send IOCTLs to the vulnerable NVIDIA graphics driver.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux operating systems, and all currently supported NVIDIA driver releases, and all GPUs except Tegra products.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dario Weisser.

This content provides more detail than the initial CVE description. It clarifies that the vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization when writing to a user-specified location using a kernel driver, leading to potential arbitrary kernel writes and local privilege escalation.
