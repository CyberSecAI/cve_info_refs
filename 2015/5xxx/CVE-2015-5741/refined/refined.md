{
  "CVE-2015-5741": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The net/http library in Go programming language does not properly handle HTTP requests with both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers, potentially leading to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, the library does not reject requests containing both headers, but instead, ignores the `Content-Length` header, which violates RFC 7230.",
    "root_cause": "The Go net/http library does not enforce the restriction specified in RFC 7230 that a message MUST NOT contain both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header. Instead of returning a 400 error, the library ignores the Content-Length header.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP Request Smuggling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security controls, perform web-cache poisoning, or alter the request/response map, potentially leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP requests with both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers to a server using the vulnerable net/http library, typically through a reverse proxy."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server that uses the vulnerable `net/http` library and is placed behind a reverse proxy or similar intermediary.",
     "additional_information": "This CVE is related to a broader set of HTTP request smuggling issues in the Go `net/http` library. This specific issue was assigned to address the violation of RFC 7230 related to handling both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers."
