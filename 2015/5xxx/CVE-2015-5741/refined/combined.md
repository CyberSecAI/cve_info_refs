| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 08:38:44 UTC  ``` There have been found potentially exploitable flaws in Golang net/http library affecting versions 1.4.2 and 1.5.  Problems: * Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error, the second Content-length is ignored. * Invalid headers are parsed as valid headers (like "Content Length:" with a space in the middle)  Exploitations: In a situation where the net/http agent HTTP communication with the final http clients is using some reverse proxy (reverse proxy cache, SSL terminators, etc), some requests can be made exploiting the net/http HTTP protocol violations.  Attacker could possibly: * bypass security controls on theses previous elements * perform some cache poisoning on these elements * alter the request/response map on these previous elements (for DOS)  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/237>  Upstream patches: <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 08:39:24 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1250353](show_bug.cgi?id=1250353 "CLOSED ERRATA - golang: HTTP request smuggling in net/http library [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c2)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 09:03:59 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1250374](show_bug.cgi?id=1250374 "CLOSED ERRATA - golang: HTTP request smuggling in net/http library [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c3)  Vincent Batts    2015-08-05 21:10:18 UTC  ``` is <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/26049f6f9171d1190f3bbe05ec304845cfe6399f> also to be included?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c4)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-06 08:53:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Mariš from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c0)) > Upstream patches: > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9>  [CVE-2015-5739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5739)  > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>  [CVE-2015-5740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5740)  > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>  [CVE-2015-5741](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5741)  Assignment details at: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/294>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c5)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-06 09:28:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Batts from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c3)) > is > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/26049f6f9171d1190f3bbe05ec304845cfe6399f> > also to be included?

# Re: CVE Request - Go net/http library - HTTP smuggling

```
Florian,

We believe that this is a potentially exploitable issue.  We would like a
CVE-ID in order to release a 1.4.3 build that has the fixes applied to the
current stable release (1.4.2) for linux distro coordination.

Commits have been made to the Go master branch to fix the problem:

<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9>
<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>
<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>

Additional background on the exploit, as provided by the reporter:

net/http problems
------------------

* Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error,
the second Content-length is ignored
* Invalid headers are parsed as valid headers (like "Content Length:" with a
space in the middle)

Exploitations
--------------

In a situation where the net/http agent HTTP communication with the final
http clients is using some reverse proxy (reverse proxy cache, SSL
terminators, etc), some requests can be made exploiting the net/http HTTP
protocol violations.

The goal of theses requests will be either:
 * to bypass security controls on theses previous elements
 * to perform some cache poisoning on these elements
 * to alter the request/response map on these previous elements (for DOS),
see for example this apache 2.4 issue:
<https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57832>

net/http: revert overly-strict part of earlier smuggling defense

```
The recent <https://golang.org/cl/11810> is reportedly a bit too
aggressive.

Apparently some HTTP requests in the wild do contain both a
Transfer-Encoding along with a bogus Content-Length. Instead of
returning a 400 Bad Request error, we should just ignore the
Content-Length like we did before.

# CVE Request - Go net/http library - HTTP smuggling

---

*From*: Jason Buberel <jbuberel () google com>

*Date*: Wed, 29 Jul 2015 15:15:45 +0000

---

```
Hello OSS Security Community,

The Go open source project has received notification of an HTTP request
smuggling vulnerability in the net/http library (
<http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/>). The vulnerability was identified in the
1.4.2 release version (<http://golang.org/dl>) and in the 1.5 release branch.

Patches have already been applied to the 1.5 release branch, and will be
ported to the 1.4.2 release branch. We will then create a 1.4.3 release.

We are requesting a CVE ID in order to coordinate updates with
distributions that include binary packages for the Go programming language.
We will also announce and request that all Go programs using the net/http
package that were compiled with version 1.4.2 or earlier be recompiled with
1.4.3 or 1.5 (when released) due to the static linking nature of the Go
toolchain.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Regards,
Jason Buberel
Product Manager, Go
Google, Inc.

```

# Re: CVE Request - Go net/http library - HTTP smuggling

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

For purposes of CVE assignments, we feel that this needs to be
categorized separately from the other parts of the report. The primary
factor is that there are different sets of affected versions. This
behavior apparently was not present in all versions of Go: it was
added in February 2012. Also, it is not really an error in determining
the semantics of a set of headers; it's a security-relevant error in
interpretation of the syntax of an individual header.

Use CVE-2015-5739.

```
> ```
> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>
>
> * Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error,
> the second Content-length is ignored
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2015-5740 for the reporter's finding of a security-relevant
RFC 7230 3.3.3 4 violation ("MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
status code").

300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f also has code changes that
were not mentioned in your "as provided by the reporter" section. Our
interpretation is that there were separate internal discoveries of
other security-relevant RFC 7230 violations, such as "MUST NOT send a
Content-Length header field in any message that contains a
Transfer-Encoding header field." Use CVE-2015-5741 for one or more
internal discoveries reflected in
300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f.

Finally, if there is a code change in
300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f that is exclusively for the
purposes of hardening (i.e., no RFC requires the change as a smuggling
security fix, and the code change is not for addressing an
individually exploitable problem), then that code change is outside
the scope of CVE.
