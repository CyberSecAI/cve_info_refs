```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Some of Django's built-in validators did not properly sanitize newline characters due to the usage of `$` instead of `\Z` in regular expressions.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Header injection vulnerability due to improper input validation.
  - Impact of exploitation: Attackers can inject arbitrary headers in HTTP responses or emails, leading to HTTP response splitting attacks.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Email messages to the EmailValidator
    - URLs to the URLValidator
    - Unspecified vectors to the `validate_ipv4_address` or `validate_slug` validators.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to supply input with newline characters to the affected validators.
