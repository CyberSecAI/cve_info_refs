CVE-2015-5590:

Root cause of vulnerability:
- A buffer overflow in the `phar_fix_filepath` function within the phar extension. The function does not check if the `newpath_len` exceeds `MAXPATHLEN`, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Lack of input validation of path length.

Impact of exploitation:
- Crash of the application.
- Potential execution of arbitrary code by an attacker.

Attack vectors:
- By processing a specially crafted, malicious phar file.
- Exploitable through the IMAP extension, as the vulnerability was triggered when processing an email with a malicious phar attachment.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to cause the execution of malicious phar code by having it included or used by the vulnerable PHP application.
