## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1236010#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-06-26 10:55:26 UTC  ``` Quoting from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/06/25/2> "Wesnoth implements a text preprocessing language that is used in conjunction  with its own game scripting language. It also has a built-in Lua interpreter  and API. Both the Lua API and the preprocessor make use of the same function  (filesystem::get_wml_location()) to resolve file paths so that only content  from the user's data directory can be read.  However, the function did not explicitly disallow files with the .pbl  extension. The contents of these files could thus be stored in saved game  files or even transmitted directly to other users in a networked game. Among  the information that's compromised is a user-defined passphrase used to  authenticate uploads to the game's content server.  This issue was found by Toom Lõhmus, then verified and fixed by Ignacio R.  Morelle."  There have been two patches, [3] and [4]. Patch [3] did only take lowercase extensions into account and was incomplete. Patch [3] is [CVE-2015-5069](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5069).

Use CVE-2015-5069 for the vulnerability in versions before 1.12.3 that
allowed access upon supplying a pathname ending in .pbl (lowercase).

>  * More general, correct fix:
>    <https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/commit/b2738ffb2fdd2550ececb74f76f75583c43c8b59>

Use CVE-2015-5070 for the vulnerability in versions 1.12.3 and earlier
that allowed access upon supplying a pathname ending with a mixed-case
or uppercase .pbl.
