  "CVE-2015-5069": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Wesnoth's text preprocessor and Lua API used the same function to resolve file paths, but it did not explicitly disallow files with the .pbl extension. This could allow the contents of .pbl files (including user-defined passphrases for content server uploads) to be stored in saved game files or transmitted to other users.",
    "details": [
      {
        "Root cause": "The function `filesystem::get_wml_location()` did not explicitly disallow files with the `.pbl` extension.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation",
          "Path traversal vulnerability"
        ],
        "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information, such as user-defined passphrases for authenticating uploads to the game's content server.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Storing malicious .pbl file paths in saved game files",
          "Transmitting malicious .pbl file paths to other users in a networked game"
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify game files or participate in a networked game."
