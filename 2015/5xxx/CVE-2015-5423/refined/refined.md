Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Hewlett-Packard KeyView IDOL parses HTML files. Specifically, there's a buffer overflow that occurs when handling table data within an HTML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability triggered by malformed HTML table data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This code executes with the privileges of the process that handles the malicious HTML file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page containing the specially crafted HTML, which, when visited, can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious File:** Alternatively, the attacker could distribute a malicious HTML file that, when opened, exploits the vulnerability.
  - In both cases, user interaction is required by the victim to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker does not need local access to the system and can exploit remotely through a network.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious web page or distribute a malicious file to the target victim.
- **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability requires user interaction. The target user needs to either open the malicious HTML file or visit a web page with the exploit.
- The vendor, Hewlett-Packard, has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-05-19 and a coordinated public release of advisory was done on 2015-08-24.
