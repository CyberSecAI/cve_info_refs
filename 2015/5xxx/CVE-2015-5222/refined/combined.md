| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1255120#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-08-19 17:02:17 UTC  ``` Cesar Wong of Red Hat reports:  Exec operations should be forbidden to privileged pods such as builder pods  because they have privileged access to nodes. Currently, you can exec into any  builder pod, getting privileged root access to the node it's running on.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1255120#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2015-08-19 19:52:45 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Cesar Wong of the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1255120#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-20 19:25:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL 7 Version of OpenShift Enterprise 3.0  Via RHSA-2015:1650 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015%3A1650)   ``` |  |
