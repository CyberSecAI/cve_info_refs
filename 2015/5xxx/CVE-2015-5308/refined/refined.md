Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5308

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `cs_admin_users.php` file of the wp-championship WordPress plugin. Specifically, data from POST and GET requests are directly incorporated into SQL queries without any form of validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is blind SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through parameters like `user`, `isadmin`, `mailservice`, `mailreceipt`, `stellv`, `champtipp` and `tippgroup` in POST requests and `userid` in GET requests. Since it's "blind," the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the queries, but they can infer information by observing changes in the application's behavior or response times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, plugin configurations, and potentially other WordPress data.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data within the plugin's tables, potentially disrupting the game, manipulating scores, or even deleting user data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially modify user roles to grant themselves administrative access to the WordPress site.
- **Complete Takeover:** In severe cases, this vulnerability can be leveraged to gain full control of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Malicious SQL code can be injected into the parameters within POST requests sent to `cs_admin_users.php`.
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Malicious SQL code can be injected into the `userid` parameter within GET requests sent to `cs_admin_users.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** An attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel to reach the vulnerable `cs_admin_users.php` page and exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send POST/GET requests to this page.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.
- **SQL Injection Tools:** Tools like `sqlmap` can be used to automate the exploitation process.
