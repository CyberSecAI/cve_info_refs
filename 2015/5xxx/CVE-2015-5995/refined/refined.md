Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Medialink MWN-WAPR300N router's reliance on HTTP cookie headers for authorization without proper validation or integrity checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The router uses the HTTP cookie header to determine if a user is authorized. It doesn't validate the integrity or authenticity of the cookie, making it susceptible to manipulation.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By modifying the cookie header to  `Cookie: language-en; admin:language-en`, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the router's web management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain complete control of the vulnerable device by bypassing authentication.
- **Configuration Changes:**  The attacker can modify router settings, potentially disrupting network operations, redirecting traffic, or exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Area Network (LAN) Attack:** An attacker on the same local network as the vulnerable router can exploit this vulnerability.
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating the HTTP cookie header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **LAN Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- **Ability to Modify HTTP Headers:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or craft HTTP requests and modify the cookie header.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior knowledge of credentials or need to be authenticated to exploit this flaw.
