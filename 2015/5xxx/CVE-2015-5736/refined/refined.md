Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-5736:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the `FortiShield.sys` driver, a minifilter filesystem driver. This driver allows establishing callbacks during specific IRP operations, which are triggered by file system interactions. The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the IOCTLs (0x220024 and 0x220028) used to set up these callbacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unrestricted Callback Registration:** The primary weakness is that any user can register an arbitrary function as a callback using the exposed IOCTLs. These callbacks are then executed with kernel privileges.
2.  **Exposed IOCTL:** The vulnerability is present because of the exposed IOCTLs 0x220024 and 0x220028 that allow registration of arbitrary callback functions with kernel privileges.
3.  **Lack of Access Control:** Insufficient access control on the IOCTLs means a regular user-mode process can leverage the vulnerable functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can achieve code execution with SYSTEM privileges by setting up a malicious callback function. This allows the attacker to perform any privileged operations on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Driver Interaction:** The attack vector involves interacting with the `FortiShield.sys` driver by sending IOCTL requests to register a callback function.
*   **Filesystem Operations:** The registered callbacks are triggered by performing IRP_MJ_WRITE or IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION operations on the filesystem, like moving a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
*   **Ability to interact with driver:** The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the `FortiShield.sys` driver.
*   **Ability to trigger file system operations:** The attacker needs to trigger an operation that results in IRP_MJ_WRITE or IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION operations to trigger the callbacks

**Additional Technical Details (from Exploit-DB entries):**

*   **SMEP Bypass (Post-Anniversary Exploit):** Some exploit versions use a technique to bypass Supervisor Mode Execution Protection (SMEP), which is a security feature in Windows.
*   **ROP Chain:** Exploits involve building a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to gain code execution. The ROP chain is written into kernel memory to overwrite function pointers in the driver and control the execution flow.
*   **Token Stealing:** The exploits demonstrate how to perform token stealing, which allows the attacker to impersonate the SYSTEM user.
*   **PTE manipulation:** Some exploits use the vulnerability to manipulate page table entries (PTE) to gain code execution.
*   **Bitmap Objects:** Some exploit versions utilize bitmap objects to leak kernel addresses and overwrite memory.
