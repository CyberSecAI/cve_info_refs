  "cve": "CVE-2015-5689",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Ghost. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Ghost images. The issue lies in sign-extending byte values from an array before using them as an index into an array, allowing for out-of-bounds access. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
