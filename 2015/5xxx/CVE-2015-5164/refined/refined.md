Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper handling of Python pickle()-encoded messages in the Qpid server on Red Hat Satellite 6. The Qpid server did not restrict message types sent from managed content hosts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the use of Python's `pickle()` for deserializing data from untrusted sources (managed content hosts). `pickle()` is known to be dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code if the pickled data is malicious.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Restriction:** The Qpid server failed to properly validate or restrict the types of messages being accepted from managed content hosts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with administrative access to a managed content host could send malicious `pickle()` encoded data that, when processed by the Satellite 6 server, could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could allow the attacker to gain complete control over the Satellite 6 server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Communication:** The attack vector involves network communication between a managed content host and the Satellite 6 server via the Qpid service.
- **Malicious Messages:** The attacker sends specifically crafted messages containing malicious pickled data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker requires administrative-level access to a managed content host within the Red Hat Satellite 6 environment. This access is needed to send malicious messages to the Qpid service running on the Satellite 6 server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Brian Bouterse of Red Hat.
- The fix involved restricting the use of pickle and switching to JSON for serialization where possible, and ensuring all celery tasks inherit from a base PulpTask class.
- The issue was tracked in Redmine as issue #23.
- The fix was applied in commit `ed36708132e18bac4ab8b58d0b56cdb2ffe95685`, and the remaining celery serializers were disabled with commit `478443a7e3fa1cbb8e4e54690533ff0537b19b56`
- The bug report in Red Hat Bugzilla is Bug #1247732.
