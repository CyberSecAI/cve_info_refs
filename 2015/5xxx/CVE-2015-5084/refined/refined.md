- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Siemens Sm@rtClient Android application stored Sm@rtServer-specific passwords using an insufficiently protected method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522). The application's storage technique allowed local attackers to extract the stored passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with access to the mobile device could retrieve Sm@rtServer-specific passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the SIMATIC HMI systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the mobile device where the vulnerable application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs physical access to the mobile device where the vulnerable Sm@rtClient application is installed. Low skill is required to exploit the vulnerability.
