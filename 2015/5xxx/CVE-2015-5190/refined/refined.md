- Root cause of vulnerability: A user-supplied string is used in running a system command within the pcsd web UI, without proper sanitization of escape characters.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Command Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the server hosting the pcsd web UI.
- Attack vectors: An attacker tricks a victim that is logged into the pcsd web UI into visiting a specially crafted URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in pcsd web UI user into visiting a crafted URL. Also the victim user must be part of the `hacluster` group.
