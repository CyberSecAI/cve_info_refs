Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5379:

**CVE-2015-5379:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Axigen WebMail Ajax interface has a vulnerability in how it handles email HTML attachments. Specifically, the "view attachment" function executes any JavaScript code embedded within these attachments.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By crafting malicious emails with HTML attachments containing JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's Axigen WebMail session.
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to various attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
    *   **Data Theft:** By running malicious JavaScript, attackers could potentially steal data accessible via the user's webmail session.
    *   **Other Attacks:**  An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect them to malicious websites, or otherwise manipulate their webmail session.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Email:** The primary attack vector is through email. A malicious user sends an email with a crafted HTML attachment to a victim user.
    *   **WebMail Interface:** The attack is triggered when the victim opens the malicious attachment using the vulnerable view attachment functionality within the Axigen WebMail Ajax interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of the vulnerable Axigen WebMail system.
    *   **No Special Access to Server:** The attacker does not need access to the Axigen server or the user's system itself, they only need to be able to send an email.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content includes a test case to verify the vulnerability:
    * A test.html file with a JavaScript alert is created.
    * This file is attached to an email, and if opening the attachment executes the javascript alert, the system is vulnerable.
* The content provides specific patches for different Axigen 8.x versions, both with and without IM (Instant Messaging) support.
*   The patch involves replacing the `actions.hsp` file in the `webmail/default/private/ajax/` directory, which mitigates the arbitrary JS execution.
*   The patch installation requires restarting or reloading the Axigen service after applying the patch.
*   Axigen versions 9.0 and higher do not contain this vulnerability by limiting attachment types for in-browser preview.
