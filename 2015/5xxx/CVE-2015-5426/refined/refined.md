- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of scenario files (.lrs) within HP LoadRunner.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A fixed-length stack buffer overflow is triggered by manipulating values within a scenario file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by having a target user open a malicious scenario file (.lrs). User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious .lrs file and have the victim open it.
