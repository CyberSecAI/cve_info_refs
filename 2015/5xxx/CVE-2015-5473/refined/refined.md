**Multiple Vulnerabilities in Samsung SyncThru**

The provided content describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities, all associated with CVE-2015-5473 and affecting Samsung SyncThru, a product for managing Samsung printers:

**1. FileUploadController Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution (Multiple Instances)**

*   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize file paths during file uploads.
*   **Weakness:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The `FileUploadController` servlet, exposed via `fileupload.html`, `uploadCloning.html`, and `uploadFirmware.html`, does not properly sanitize file paths.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can upload files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*  **Attack Vector:**  Remote, unauthenticated attacker uploads a file with a crafted path to overwrite or place executable files on the system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**2. DriverFileUploadServlet Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution**
*   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize file paths during file uploads.
*   **Weakness:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The `DriverFileUploadServlet` servlet, exposed via `upload/driver`, does not properly sanitize file paths for certain ZIP files.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can upload specially crafted ZIP files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Remote, unauthenticated attacker uploads a specially crafted ZIP file with a crafted path to overwrite or place executable files on the system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. UpdateDriverFileServlet Directory Traversal Denial of Service**

*   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize file paths during file uploads, specifically in relation to file deletion.
*   **Weakness:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The `DriverFileUploadServlet` servlet, exposed via `upload/updateDriver`, does not properly sanitize file paths, allowing the deletion of files.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the system, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker uploads a file with a crafted path to specify which file should be deleted.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**4. AddDriverFileServlet Directory Traversal Denial of Service**

*   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize file paths during file uploads, specifically in relation to file deletion.
*   **Weakness:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The `AddDriverFileServlet` servlet, exposed via `upload/addDriver`, does not properly sanitize file paths, allowing the deletion of files.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the system, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker uploads a file with a crafted path to specify which file should be deleted.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Commonalities:**

*   **Affected Product:** All vulnerabilities affect Samsung SyncThru.
*   **Authentication:** None of the described vulnerabilities require authentication by default.
*   **Root Cause:** Path sanitization issues during file uploads.
*   **Resolution:** All vulnerabilities were resolved in Samsung SyncThru 6 v1.0.

**Summary**

CVE-2015-5473 encompasses multiple distinct vulnerabilities within Samsung SyncThru that stem from a failure to properly sanitize file paths during file uploads. These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution (in some cases as SYSTEM) or cause denial-of-service conditions by deleting arbitrary files.  The attack vector for all is through unauthenticated remote access.
