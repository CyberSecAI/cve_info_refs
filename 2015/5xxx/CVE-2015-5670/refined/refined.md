Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5670

**Vulnerability Description:**
Enisys Gw, an open-source groupware, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Input Sanitization: The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided data before it is displayed within the application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
- Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): The vulnerability is specifically identified as a reflected cross-site scripting issue, where the malicious script is embedded in a request and reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's web browser.
- Potential for Further Attacks: XSS can be used to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, deface websites, redirect users to malicious sites, or inject keyloggers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access (AV:N): The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker does not need local or adjacent network access.
- Crafted Requests: An attacker crafts a malicious request containing the XSS payload. When the application processes this request and displays the data, the script is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
-  The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with the crafted request.

**Affected Products:**
- Enisys Gw version 1.4.0 and earlier.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the latest version provided by the vendor, which addresses this issue.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- Base Score: 4.3
- Access Vector: Network (N)
- Access Complexity: Medium (M)
- Authentication: None (N)
- Confidentiality Impact: None (N)
- Integrity Impact: Partial (P)
- Availability Impact: None (N)

**Additional Notes:**
The vulnerability was reported by Shoji Baba and coordinated by JPCERT/CC with the vendor, Techno Project Japan Co. The vendor has since released a version, 2.0.1, as shown on their website.
