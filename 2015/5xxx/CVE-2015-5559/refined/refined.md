Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-5559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple flaws were discovered in how Adobe Flash Player displays certain SWF content. These flaws stem from memory corruption vulnerabilities in the Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Memory corruption vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player when handling SWF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious SWF file that, when loaded by a victim, can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the Flash Player plugin.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious SWF files can also cause the Flash Player to crash, leading to a denial of service condition.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Some vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information.
*  **Security Restriction Bypass**: Some vulnerabilities may allow for the bypass of security restrictions implemented within Flash Player.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SWF Files:** The primary attack vector involves creating specially crafted SWF files.
*   **Websites:** Attackers can embed these malicious SWF files on websites.
*   **Malware:** Attackers can use various methods to deliver the malicious SWF files to the victim's system, including drive-by downloads or compromised websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious SWF file to the victim's browser. This can be done remotely via websites, phishing emails, etc.
*   **Crafting Malicious SWF:** The attacker needs the technical expertise to craft SWF files that can trigger the vulnerabilities within the Flash Player.
*   **No User Interaction (Potentially):** While user interaction is required to load a page containing the malicious SWF, some attack scenarios may lead to exploitation automatically upon page load if the user does not explicitly disable the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that multiple CVEs were addressed in the same update, with CVE-2015-5559 being one of them.
*  The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for remote code execution.
*  The vulnerability affected all architectures that used the vulnerable versions of Flash Player.
*  The fix involved updating the Flash Player to version 11.2.202.508 or higher.

In summary, CVE-2015-5559, along with other related CVEs, highlights a critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player which allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by using maliciously crafted SWF files, making it a serious threat at the time.
