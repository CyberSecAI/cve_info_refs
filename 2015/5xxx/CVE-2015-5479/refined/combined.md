# libav: divide-by-zero in ff\_h263\_decode\_mba()

Posted on [July 16, 2015](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2015/07/16/libav-divide-by-zero-in-ff_h263_decode_mba/ "11:57 am") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[Libav](https://libav.org/) is an open source set of tools for audio and video processing.

After talking with Luca Barbato which is both a Gentoo and Libav developer, I spent a bit of my time fuzzing libav and in particular I fuzzed libavcodec though avplay.

I hit a crash and after I reported it to upstream, they confirmed the issue as a divide-by-zero.

The complete gdb output:

# USN-2944-1: Libav vulnerabilities

4 April 2016

Libav could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libav](/security/cves?package=libav) - Multimedia player, server, encoder and transcoder

## Details

It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed media

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libavformat53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libav)
  -
  [4:0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libav/4%3A0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2)
* [libavcodec53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libav)
  -
  [4:0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libav/4%3A0.8.17-0ubuntu0.12.04.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
