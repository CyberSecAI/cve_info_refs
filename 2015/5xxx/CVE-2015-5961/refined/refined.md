Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Firefox Accounts signup process, specifically the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) error screen, was loading external web content from a static URI directly into the B2G (Boot to Gecko) root process. This allowed the loading of arbitrary web content into a privileged process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure handling of external web content within a privileged process.
- Lack of proper sandboxing or isolation for the loaded external content.
- The external link was not using HTTPS, potentially allowing a MITM attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject arbitrary web content into the B2G root process. This could lead to:
- Execution of malicious code with root privileges.
- Potential compromise of the entire device.
- Data exfiltration.
- Other malicious activities due to the compromised root process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the Firefox Accounts signup flow.
- An attacker would need to entice a user to trigger the COPPA error screen.
- A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker could also potentially redirect the HTTP request for the external content to their malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerability and the steps to trigger it.
- The attacker needs to have a position to control a vulnerable device's network connection or be able to perform a MITM attack.
- They would also have to coerce a user to complete the steps to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was present in Firefox OS versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, but fixed in 2.2 and master.
- The fix involved including the oop config for BrowserFrame to isolate the content.
- A custom element was used to handle the stringification of the error message.
- The initial severity was considered high, but later downgraded to moderate due to the requirements for exploitation.
- The issue is related to how external content was being embedded in the system app.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the implemented fix.
