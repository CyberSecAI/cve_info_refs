Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the `Mapper` component in Apache Tomcat processes redirects for directory requests. It performs the redirect before checking security constraints and Filters. This allows a malicious actor to infer the existence of a directory even if access is restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By requesting a URL without a trailing slash, an attacker can observe whether Tomcat redirects to the same URL with a trailing slash. If a redirect occurs, it indicates that a directory with the given name exists; if no redirect occurs, the directory is non-existent or inaccessible. This allows an attacker to enumerate the directories within a web application, even those behind security constraints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can detect the existence of a directory, and potentially map out the internal structure of the application.
*   An attacker can determine whether or not a given path is a valid directory.
*   If at the context root, an attacker can confirm if a web application exists even if a user does not have access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via an HTTP request without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Tomcat server.
*   The attacker does not require any prior knowledge or special privileges.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.45
    *   Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.68
    *   Apache Tomcat 8.x before 8.0.30
    *   Apache Tomcat 9.x before 9.0.0.M2
*   **Fix**:
    *   The vulnerability was fixed by moving the redirection functionality from the Mapper to the DefaultServlet. This ensures that any security constraints or Filters are applied before any redirect takes place.
    *   Two new context configuration options were added `mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled` and `mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled` for configuration of the behaviour
*   The vulnerability is present in a wide variety of products that utilize Apache Tomcat (various Red Hat, SUSE, Debian, Oracle, and other products)
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mark Koek of QCSec.
*  The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication.
