- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in IBM Security Access Manager for Web.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the Operating System of the appliance. This is due to insufficient input validation, allowing injection of malicious commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the LMI (Local Management Interface) can use this vulnerability to gain elevated access to the appliance, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a command injection attack through the LMI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the LMI of the IBM Security Access Manager for Web appliance. This generally implies having some level of legitimate access, although the specific level is not defined.
