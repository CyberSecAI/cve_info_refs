 ## Analysis of CVE-2015-5718
 

 The provided content relates to CVE-2015-5718.
 

 ### Root cause of vulnerability
 The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `handle_debug_network` function of the Websense Content Manager administrative interface. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy data into a 512-byte buffer named "dest", without proper bounds checking.
 

 ### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
 - Stack-based buffer overflow: The `strcpy` function is vulnerable to buffer overflows when the source string exceeds the destination buffer's size.
 - Lack of input validation:  The application does not validate the length of the input being copied into the buffer, leading to the overflow.
 

 ### Impact of exploitation
 - Denial of service: Overwriting the stack can cause the `content_manager` application to crash.
 - Arbitrary code execution: By carefully crafting the overflow payload, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses and execute arbitrary code. This is made more feasible when combined with a CSRF attack.
 

 ### Attack vectors
 - HTTP POST request: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/submit_net_debug.cgi` endpoint. The `cmd_param` parameter is used to inject overflow data
 - CSRF Attack: The advisory mentions the vulnerability can be used in combination with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, implying that an attacker could potentially trick a logged in administrator into triggering the vulnerable code.
 

 ### Required attacker capabilities/position
 - Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Websense Content Manager administrative interface, typically on port 8081.
 - Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint: The attacker must know the specific path (`/submit_net_debug.cgi`) and the vulnerable parameter (`cmd_param`)
 - CSRF exploitation requires the attacker to be able to induce a legitimate user to submit the malicious request.
 

 ### Additional Details
 - The provided exploit demonstrates overwriting multiple CPU registers, including the stack pointer, and causes a segmentation fault.
 - The affected version of Websense Triton Content Manager is 8.0.0 build 1165. The fix is in hotfix V8.0.0 HF02.
 - The vulnerable function is located in `/home/cmbuild/Compass-Proxy/src/dev/WCG/traffic/proxy/mgmt2/web2/WebHttpRender.cc`
