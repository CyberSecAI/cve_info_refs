{
  "CVE-2015-5295": {
    "description": "The template-validate command in OpenStack Heat allows an authenticated user to cause a denial of service by referencing a local file like /dev/zero, which leads to arbitrary local file content being loaded, resulting in memory exhaustion.",
    "affected_component": "OpenStack Heat",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary file read",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can cause a denial of service by exploiting the vulnerability. Additionally, the user can potentially determine if a file exists on the heat engine server and if the heat engine service can access it, even though the content of the file is not exposed back to the user.",
    "attack_vector": "By providing a specially crafted template to the `template-validate` command, an authenticated user can trick the heat engine service into loading arbitrary local file content by using a file:/// URI. A hash character (#) can be used to bypass extension checks.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenStack Heat service.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered using the `heat template-validate` command, as well as via stack creation or update operations.",
      "The `python-heatclient` is also affected, where the vulnerability can be exploited if a malicious template is provided locally to the client.",
      "The vulnerability is due to bypassing the `global_environment()` when using the `env.get_class`, and the `template_resource.generate_class` wrongly defaults the `get_template_file` allowed schemas to `('file',)`. This allows reading local files using user-provided paths.",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion by referencing a file like `/dev/zero`",
      "The patch for this vulnerability introduces a `get_class_to_instantiate()` method to the Environment to avoid generating classes via `generate_class` except for the global environment.",
       "Initial attempts to restrict file access to `/etc/heat/templates/` were found to be insufficient due to path traversal vulnerabilities.",
        "The vulnerability was initially found in the `template-validate` command but was later found to also impact other code paths within heat, including the stack validation path.",
        "The fix ensures that user defined resources do not result in reads from the local filesystem, limiting it to resources defined in the global environment."
