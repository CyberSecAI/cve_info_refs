Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Adobe Flash Player's handling of vector lengths. Specifically, the 'capacity' field of Vector.<primitive> objects, used to store dynamic arrays of primitive data types is not protected by a XOR check, and is located before the XOR-protected 'length' field. This lack of protection allows for memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Vector Length Corruption:** The capacity field within the vector object is not protected, so an attacker can manipulate it if they have a memory corruption vulnerability (such as a heap overflow) to overwrite this field, while leaving the XOR-protected length field intact. By increasing the capacity to a value greater than allocated, the runtime may assume a larger allocation than what actually exists.

2.  **Unprotected Capacity Field:** The fact that the capacity is not protected by the same XOR check that is applied to the length allows for this exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vector-length corruption can lead to a crash, achieving a DoS attack.
2.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the capacity field, an attacker can create a vector that aliases with other parts of the heap memory. Then an attacker can write to a target memory location and read back by reading data into the vector and extending past allocation. This can potentially be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Network-based attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through malicious SWF files served on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Memory Corruption Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an existing memory corruption vulnerability, such as a heap overflow, to corrupt the vector's capacity field and to read from memory location.
2.  **Ability to Serve SWF File:** The attacker needs to serve a malicious SWF file containing the exploit.
3.  **Target User Action:** A user needs to load or execute the malicious SWF file for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional details:**
*   The exploit relies on the specific structure of the Vector object in memory, making it less effective once Vector objects are fully moved out of the heap.
*   The vulnerability is on the heap which makes it more difficult to exploit for arbitrary code execution.
*   The vendor (Adobe) recommends moving the XOR-protected length before the capacity to better protect against overflows or guarding the capacity field with a similar check.

The provided information gives a more in-depth explanation of the technical details of the vulnerability than the official CVE description. The official CVE description mentions "vector-length corruption" without detailing how to trigger it, while the supplied information discusses the role of the unguarded capacity field and how it may allow a heap overflow and arbitrary code execution.

It's also noted this vulnerability was addressed in Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.521 on Linux, 18.0.0.241 and 19.0.0.185 on Windows and OS X
