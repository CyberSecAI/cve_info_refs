```
Root cause of vulnerability: The PortletBridge PortletRequestDispatcher did not respect security constraints set by the servlet when a portlet request was made for rendering a non-JSF resource like JSP or HTML.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Failure to properly enforce security constraints for non-JSF resources. This could allow access to resources that should be restricted by the servlet.

Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker could bypass security constraints and gain unauthorized access to restricted resources. This could lead to information disclosure.

Attack vectors: A remote attacker sends a portlet request for rendering a non-JSF resource (e.g. JSP or HTML).

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable system. No specific authentication or user interaction is mentioned in the provided information, suggesting that the attacker could be unauthenticated.
