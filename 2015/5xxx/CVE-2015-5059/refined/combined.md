Use CVE-2015-5059 for the issue in which $g_view_proj_doc_threshold
had been ANYBODY but is supposed to be VIEWER.

Is there any related security problem caused by this possible
inconsistency in the code:

  define( 'ANYBODY', 0 );

  function access_get_global_level

          if( empty( $p_user_id ) && !auth_is_user_authenticated() ) {
                  return false;

  function access_get_project_level

          if( empty( $p_user_id ) && !auth_is_user_authenticated() ) {
                  return ANYBODY;

? In other words, is an unauthenticated client sometimes, but not always,
considered to have the ANYBODY access level?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1237199#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-30 14:09:43 UTC  ``` In MantisBT, the "Project Documentation" feature can be used to attach files to a project. When this feature is enabled ($g_enable_project_documentation = ON) and the threshold to view these files is left to its default value ($g_view_proj_doc_threshold = ANYBODY), any registered user in the system can download every such attachment, including those which are linked to private projects to which the user does not have access. This can be achieved by calling the download script directly, and specifying the ID of the file to download, e.g.  <http://example.com/mantis/file_download.php?file_id=123&type=doc>  Affected versions: - <= 1.2.19 - <= 1.3.0-beta.2  Originally reported on <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/791> Upstream patches:  - 1.2.x: <http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/f39cf525>  - 1.3.x: <http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/a4be76d6>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1237199#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-30 14:10:06 UTC  ```  Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1237200](show_bug.cgi?id=1237200 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5059 mantis: information disclosure due to too wide $g_view_proj_doc_threshold permission [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1237201](show_bug.cgi?id=1237201 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5059 mantis: information disclosure due to too wide $g_view_proj_doc_threshold permission [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1237199#c2)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-07 13:08:40 UTC  ``` mantis-1.2.19-3.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.
