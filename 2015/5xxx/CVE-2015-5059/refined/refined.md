Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive default configuration in MantisBT. The `$g_view_proj_doc_threshold` setting, which controls who can view project documentation files, was set to `ANYBODY` by default. This allowed any user, including those not members of a private project, to download documentation files associated with that project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unauthorized disclosure of project documentation files. This includes attachments linked to private projects, exposing potentially sensitive information to users who should not have access.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system failed to enforce proper access controls, allowing any authenticated user to download project documentation files regardless of their project membership.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Attackers could gain access to private project documents, potentially containing sensitive information such as project plans, design documents, or confidential communications. This unauthorized access could lead to a breach of confidentiality for the project and the organization.
*   **Data Leakage:**  The leakage of project documentation could result in financial loss, competitive disadvantage, or damage to reputation, especially if the leaked data is of strategic or sensitive nature.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The primary attack vector is through direct access to the `file_download.php` script by specifying the `file_id` parameter in the URL, like this: `http://example.com/mantis/file_download.php?file_id=123&type=doc`.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the MantisBT system, although they do not need to have any specific role or be part of the project to which the documentation is attached.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered MantisBT User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the MantisBT instance.
*   **Knowledge of File IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the `file_id` of the document they wish to access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved by changing the default value of `$g_view_proj_doc_threshold` from `ANYBODY` to `VIEWER`, which restricts access to project members.
*   The fix was implemented in MantisBT versions 1.2.20 and 1.3.0-rc1, and backported to earlier versions.
