Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the blog post related to CVE-2015-5376:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation within the login form of WiNPAT Portal 3. Specifically, the username field allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form.
- Lack of input validation in the username field of the login form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
- This could lead to data exfiltration, modification or deletion, and potential full control over the database and application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the login form of the WiNPAT Portal 3 web application.
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL commands by manipulating the `LoginControl%24txtUserLogin` HTTP POST parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable login page.

**Additional details:**
- The blog post confirms the vulnerability to be present in versions 3.2.0.1001 to 3.6.1.0, but it may be applicable to a wider version range.
- The author provides a basic proof-of-concept to validate the SQL injection using a time-based delay, and recommends using `sqlmap` to further exploit the vulnerability.
