Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5078:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located within the `dataentry.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `insert()` function of `application/controllers/admin/dataentry.php`. The original code contains a SQL query that directly includes the `$submitdate` variable without sanitization using `dbQuoteAll()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information)
    - Data modification (tampering with survey results or other data)
    - Data deletion
    - Potential privilege escalation depending on database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `insert()` function in `application/controllers/admin/dataentry.php`
- The attacker would need to manipulate the `submitdate` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would likely need access to the administrative panel or the vulnerable endpoint that calls the `insert()` function. They need to be able to control or manipulate input parameters that include the `$submitdate` variable

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content clearly shows a commit that was created to fix the vulnerability which was a SQL injection by using `dbQuoteAll()` to sanitize the `$submitdate` variable.
- This content provides details about the specific file and function vulnerable which is more detailed than the CVE description.
