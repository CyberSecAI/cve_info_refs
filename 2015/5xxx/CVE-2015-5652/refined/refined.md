Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Python for Windows' insecure DLL search path. Specifically, it may load a DLL named `readline.pyd` from an untrusted location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading:** Python for Windows doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads dynamic libraries (DLLs). It's susceptible to loading a malicious `readline.pyd` from the current directory, instead of the intended location, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `python.exe` process.
- **Compromise of Python Environment:** This allows the attacker to fully compromise the Python environment, potentially leading to further system compromise and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Placement:** An attacker would need to place a malicious `readline.pyd` file in the same directory where `python.exe` is executed.
- **Social Engineering/Phishing:** Attackers might lure users into executing a Python script in a directory containing the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the file system in a location where the Python script or `python.exe` might be executed.
- **User Interaction:** Requires the user to execute the python interpreter from a compromised directory.

**Additional Information:**
- **Workaround:** The workaround suggests ensuring no file named "readline.pyd" exists in the current directory when executing python.exe to mitigate the risk.
- **Vendor Acknowledgment:** The vendor stated that this is a "longtime behavior of Python".

The provided documents offer a good level of detail regarding the vulnerability, providing the root cause, attack vectors, potential impact, and a practical workaround to minimize the risk.
