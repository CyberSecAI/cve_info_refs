# tripleo-heat-templates: unsafe pipeline ordering of swift staticweb middleware

Bug #1494896 reported by
[James Slagle](https://launchpad.net/~james-slagle)
on 2015-09-11

[262](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

### Bug Description

Christian Schwede and Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported a

vulnerability in tripleo-heat-templates. When the staticweb middleware

is enabled, it is incorrectly configured before the keystone auth

middleware, reporting containers with enabled staticweb listings to

be empty and private while in fact being public accessible. A possible

unrecognized information leak might be the result. All setups configured

with staticweb middleware are affected.

Since [https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1489749](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/%2Bbug/1489749) has nothing to do with puppet-swift anymore, I think we can switch it to public now.

Author: Emilien Macchi <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Sep 11 14:51:02 2015 -0400

Put staticweb middleware after keystoneauth in proxy pipeline

The staticweb middleware needs to be put after authentication

    middlewares to ensure correct functionality as documented in

    <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/middleware.html#staticweb>

Without this Swift sends a HTML response even if the request was done

    using a X-Auth-Token. This might result in a faulty handling of the response on

    the client side; for example, "swift stat containername" would report an empty,

    private container, while the container might actually be public readable with

    data stored in it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1267883#c0)  Mike Burns    2015-10-01 09:47:10 UTC  ``` This is the THT part of the fix  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1240587](show_bug.cgi?id=1240587 "CLOSED ERRATA - Unable to control the file_descriptors limit for rabbitmq-server via the director.") +++  Description of problem: Unable to control the file_descriptors limit for rabbitmq-server via the director.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Current.  How reproducible: Always.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Deploy an overcloud using OSP-d.  Actual results: rabbitmq-sever is launched via the rabbitmq resource agent using the following file_descriptors limit :  # pcs resource show rabbitmq  Resource: rabbitmq (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=rabbitmq-cluster)   Attributes: set_policy="ha-all ^(?!amq\.).* {"ha-mode":"all"}"    Operations: start interval=0s timeout=100 (rabbitmq-start-timeout-100)               stop interval=0s timeout=90 (rabbitmq-stop-timeout-90)               monitor interval=10 timeout=40 (rabbitmq-monitor-interval-10)  # rabbitmqctl report | grep -A3 file_descriptors  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,924},                     {total_used,3},                     {sockets_limit,829},                     {sockets_used,1}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,924},                     {total_used,3},                     {sockets_limit,829},                     {sockets_used,1}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,924},                     {total_used,152},                     {sockets_limit,829},                     {sockets_used,150}]},  Expected results: rabbitmq-server is launched via the rabbitmq resource agent but is able to control the file_descriptors limit via a parameter. As requested in [BZ#1240561](show_bug.cgi?id=1240561 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [RFE] Add a parameter to the rabbitmq agent to control the file_descriptors limit").  Additional info:   --- Additional comment from David Vossel on 2015-07-07 11:31:00 EDT ---  (In reply to Rafael Rosa from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1267883#c3)) > Can the file_descriptors limit be increased manually as a work around?

If you would try to run puppet manifest manually without RHOSd, the parameter would be changed.  --- Additional comment from Marius Cornea on 2015-09-30 17:55:23 EDT ---  The tripleo-heat-templates patch attached to the bug doesn't seem to be present in the 09-25 puddle. Was it updated so it can take the fd limit as parameter? I'm trying to verify this but we should be able to pass the fd limit as a parameter, not run puppet manually.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1267883#c3)  Marius Cornea    2015-10-02 13:29:52 UTC  ``` stack@instack:~>>> cat templates/rabbit.yaml  parameters:     RabbitFDLimit: 7192  stack@instack:~>>> openstack overcloud deploy --templates ~/templates/my-overcloud -e ~/templates/my-overcloud/environments/network-isolation.yaml -e ~/templates/network-environment.yaml --control-scale 3 --compute-scale 1 --ceph-storage-scale 0 --ntp-server clock.redhat.com --libvirt-type qemu -e ~/templates/rabbit.yaml   stack@instack:~>>> for ip in $(nova list  | grep controller |  awk '{print $12;}' | cut -d "=" -f2); do ssh heat-admin@$ip 'sudo rabbitmqctl report | grep -A3 file_descriptors';done  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,3},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,1}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,4},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,2}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,197},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,195}]},  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,3},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,1}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,197},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,195}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,4},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,2}]},  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,197},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,195}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,4},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,2}]}, --  {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,7092},                     {total_used,3},                     {sockets_limit,6380},                     {sockets_used,1}]},   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1267883#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-08 12:19:55 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Subject: [PATCH] Put staticweb middleware after keystoneauth in proxy pipeline
The staticweb middleware needs to be put after authentication
middlewares to ensure correct functionality as documented in
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/middleware.html#staticweb
Without this Swift sends a HTML response even if the request was done
using a X-Auth-Token. This might result in a faulty handling of the response on
the client side; for example, "swift stat containername" would report an empty,
private container, while the container might actually be public readable with
data stored in it.

I'm setting this as Depending On [bug 1259905](show_bug.cgi?id=1259905 "CLOSED ERRATA - Integrate yum updates of overcloud with Puppet") (which implements the Puppet integration). It *appears* that you're testing a puddle without that support, because the yum update command is updating openstack services directly and there's no evidence of a puppet run. With the patches for [bug 1259905](show_bug.cgi?id=1259905 "CLOSED ERRATA - Integrate yum updates of overcloud with Puppet"), yum should stop updating the openstack services (it will only update packages not managed by Puppet) and puppet should update them instead.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c5)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2015-09-16 11:54:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to chris alfonso from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c2)) > What are the specific problems that are caused by this.

What is going to be tricky is only stopping the cluster when there is actually something to update. Two possibilities come to mind:  * Do the cluster stop + start only after the package update, and only if something actually changed. * Always stop + start the cluster regardless of whether anything is changing. This may be fine for a 3+ node HA cluster? I think there's also a case though where we're deploying on a single controller but still using Pacemaker? It seems suboptimal in that case.

We will need to review this sequence once OSPd can deploy Instance HA feature because you will need a slightly different order of commands to update compute nodes.

What about doing a yum dry run to check if there are updates and then take action?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c9)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-16 19:13:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabio Massimo Di Nitto from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c8)) > What about doing a yum dry run to check if there are updates and then take > action?  That could be a possibility. As I mentioned in [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c3) though, we're aiming to have Puppet take care of the updates to the OpenStack services using ensure => latest. So this might add significant extra complexity in that case.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c10)  David Hill    2015-09-17 15:20:23 UTC  ``` I'm not sure it's the same bug but here is another overcloud that broke while updating : <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1263855>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c11)  chris alfonso    2015-09-17 16:18:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1263855](show_bug.cgi?id=1263855) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c13)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-18 15:59:57 UTC  ``` So, to clarify, we're talking purely about z-stream updates here. No DB migrations. No RPC version changes. Just z-stream bug fixes.  Do we really have to stop the entire cluster once for every controller node to be updated? That doesn't sound very HA. In fact, it sounds a lot less HA than not using Pacemaker at all would be.  Can you go more into the specific reasons why the entire cluster has to be stopped while we install an updated version of an OpenStack service with a minor bug fix? It's really hard to know how best to work within the constraints that we're seeing here without knowing what is driving them.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c14)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-18 16:02:22 UTC  ``` BTW the plan for reboots is that we will not automatically do them as part of the package update (i.e. minor z-stream update) process. There will be a separate "openstack overcloud ..." command to do a rolling reboot of nodes if e.g. the yum update has installed a new kernel and the user wants to start making use of it.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c15)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-18 17:59:47 UTC  ``` OK, attempting to answer my own questions to some extent after discussions on IRC:  * The "cluster stop" suggestion is missing a parameter, which confused me as to its meaning. The command is in fact "cluster stop <node>", so it only stops pacemaker on one node: <http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-pcs/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/_perform_a_failover.html>  * The "cluster standby <node>" suggestion does seem better to me - keep Pacemaker running so the other cluster members know about it but just shut down the services it manages: <http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-pcs/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/_test_cluster_failover.html>  * As I mentioned in [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c14), we're planning to implement a separate reboot command. That one will definitely want to do "cluster stop <node>", but given that this script does not include a reboot I think we should be able to get away with "cluster standby <node>".  * There is probably no need to get Puppet involved in cases where Pacemaker is managing the services. In those cases, the knowledge of how to restart them in the correct order rests with Pacemaker, not Puppet.  * For OSP Director, we always deploy controller nodes with Pacemaker (even if there is only one of them). So we need Puppet integration only for compute nodes? (Or do those use Pacemaker too?) Are there any services managed by Puppet but not under Pacemaker control in a Pacemaker-enabled deployment?  * For upstream tripleo, however, deploying with Pacemaker remains optional so we'll need to play nice with that code in any event.  * Doing "yum list updates" seems like a good way of determining whether the cluster member actually needs to be placed in standby/stopped prior to the update - we could compare to the list of packages being managed by Puppet, or maybe just to the Pacemaker config somehow. We should probably use the output of this command to feed back into the actual yum update, so that we don't get race conditions.  * Even better might be to do "yum update -y --downloadonly" and then use the transaction saved in /tmp with "yum load-transaction" so that we get exactly the versions we were expecting and can't accidentally pull in anything else from an even-newer version of a package that may have appeared.  * For bonus points, we could use the "yum deplist command" to get the list of all packages which the openstack services are depending on, so that we could be sure to restart the service even if only a library changed. Unfortunately you have to do it recursively to get everything though, which sounds very slow.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c16)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2015-09-18 18:01:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Zane Bitter from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c13)) > So, to clarify, we're talking purely about z-stream updates here.

I never said the entire cluster has to be stopped at once. I said one node at a time has to be stopped, updated and then started again in sequence. See [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c5) and [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c6).  > That doesn't sound very HA.

If the update is pulling in also pacemaker & co updates, you need to special case and restart them manually.

That doesn´t work for all packages unfortunately. So be careful. Due to some restrictions not all packages can express a dependency properly. I can bring you a few examples if necessary (hence my comment above).   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c19)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-20 16:52:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabio Massimo Di Nitto from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c18)) > (In reply to Zane Bitter from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c15)) > > * Doing "yum list updates" seems like a good way of determining whether the > > cluster member actually needs to be placed in standby/stopped prior to the > > update - we could compare to the list of packages being managed by Puppet, > > or maybe just to the Pacemaker config somehow.

Well what we have now is we run yum, and whatever services get restarted by the %postupgrade scripts get restarted, though probably not in the correct order.  What we were planning is to get Puppet involved, so that Puppet would do the restarts in the order that is required when packages it knows about demand that. This is strictly better.  What I was suggesting here is to calculate the dependencies recursive using yum and restart the cluster member if any dependencies yum knows about have changed. This, while far from perfect, is strictly better than either of the previous two approaches. It may or may not be practical though - "yum deplist" is not recursive, so it could get messy very quickly.  I don't really see RDO Manager/Director's role here as introducing new system administration tools, so much as knowing about the topology of the OpenStack deployment such that it can orchestrate the existing administration tools, like yum. A sysadmin is still going to need to decide when a yum update is sufficient and when they want to reboot all the nodes, which we will provide a separate command to orchestrate.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c20)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2015-09-20 17:45:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Zane Bitter from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c19)) > (In reply to Fabio Massimo Di Nitto from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c18)) > > (In reply to Zane Bitter from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c15)) > > > * Doing "yum list updates" seems like a good way of determining whether the > > > cluster member actually needs to be placed in standby/stopped prior to the > > > update - we could compare to the list of packages being managed by Puppet, > > > or maybe just to the Pacemaker config somehow.

Nope that´s not completely coorect. %postupgrade does a restart only if the service is already started and registered with systemd.  When a systemd service is managed by pacemaker, pacemaker adds some extra data to the unit file (in override mode) that will filter out those restarts since the service is managed externally.  >  > What we were planning is to get Puppet involved, so that Puppet would do the > restarts in the order that is required when packages it knows about demand > that. This is strictly better.  If a service is running under pacemaker, have pacemaker handle the restart. If you start adding a 3rd layers for managing services (between systemd/puppet/pacemaker) it´s going to be a receipt for disasters.  >  > What I was suggesting here is to calculate the dependencies recursive using > yum and restart the cluster member if any dependencies yum knows about have > changed. This, while far from perfect, is strictly better than either of the > previous two approaches. It may or may not be practical though - "yum > deplist" is not recursive, so it could get messy very quickly.  As I explained before, yum dependencies can´t always be expressed properly. There are packages out there that do lack explicit dependencies. Take for example resource-agents. It cannot by definition, pull in all dependencies for each agent that it can drive. Hence, you cannot assume that upgrading a package won´t affect something else.  >  > I don't really see RDO Manager/Director's role here as introducing new > system administration tools, so much as knowing about the topology of the > OpenStack deployment such that it can orchestrate the existing > administration tools, like yum.

Agreed. that´s why I mentioned in [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c5) "pcs cluster start || reboot" <- can´t make that call automatically.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c23)  Steve Baker    2015-09-21 21:32:46 UTC  ``` "cluster start is an async operation. there is no perfect way to block here because you don´t know exactly when all resources will complete their start operation.

Once pacemaker is up, (pcs cluster start) you can safely move to the next. waiting for galera is a good safety measure. there is no race either ways.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c27)  Zane Bitter    2015-09-23 23:51:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabio Massimo Di Nitto from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c25)) > pcs status >  > but the point is that there is no race.

OK, I think I would separate this problem into three concerns: - That we could move on and disable Pacemaker on the next node before it has fully started on the current node, and thus lose quorum. I think this is what you're referring to when you say there is no 'race'. - That we could move on and disable Pacemaker on the next node and then the node after that before the services have finished starting on this node, with the result that we have a service down on all 3 nodes of a setup at the same time. This is what Steve meant when he talked about a 'race'. - That something could fail to start after an update deployment had reported success. This is our last chance to detect any problems, and we don't want to miss it because the orchestration will go on and likely cause the same problem on the other nodes too.  We can all agree that monitoring "pcs status" clearly solves the first concern. Once Pacemaker has joined the cluster, the other members will recognise that and there will be no loss of quorum. BTW what specifically should we be looking for in that output?  It's not clear, but I think you're suggesting that waiting for Galera to start would help with the second concern. This will probably work, because Galera is likely to take long enough to start up that it's unlikely that we would have time for it to start up on the second node and for us to go ahead and disable the cluster on the third node before the rest of the services on the first node could start up. But it doesn't sound inherently safe, it's just a weird timing issue away from disaster. Can we get the information we need to prevent this from "pcs status"? If not, how can we get it? How are you proposing to check that Galera is active? Maybe we can do the same with the other services.  AFAICT, none of the ideas discussed so far help at all with the third concern. How can we be sure to wait long enough that we can detect any errors with services failing to start up so that we can report the results?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c28)  Steve Baker    2015-09-24 00:07:39 UTC  ``` If all we care about is that the current node is back in the cluster then something like the following can be run in a loop until there is a match      pcs status | grep "Online:.*$HOSTNAME.*"  This loop would need a timeout.  The command "pcs status xml" outputs structured data which includes the state of nodes and resources. I think it is worthwhile to eventually write a python script which blocks until there is an entry for every crm_mon.resources.resource[*].node[name=$HOSTNAME]. Until that script (or something based on another pcs command) exists there is a risk that a package upgrade will happily break resources on every node until HA is lost.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c29)  Steve Baker    2015-09-24 00:10:29 UTC  ``` [comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c27) and [comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c28) collided in mid air.

As long as pacemaker daemon is started, and it's online (as noted in the comment below) than there is no loss of quorum.  > - That we could move on and disable Pacemaker on the next node and then the > node after that before the services have finished starting on this node, > with the result that we have a service down on all 3 nodes of a setup at the > same time.

That can't happen because pacemaker would relocate the service on another node (there is the 3rd node remember?).  > - That something could fail to start after an update deployment had reported > success.

Ok, that's a different pandora's box. This issue would have to be detected by testing upgrades before we send them to customers. But yes I agree that parsing all would be ideal. The complexity here is that you don't know ahead of time which services are supposed to be running on a given node. So you don't really know what to look for.  >  > We can all agree that monitoring "pcs status" clearly solves the first > concern.

Well you shouldn't stop node 2 till node 1 has completed to have galera up and in master state, and surely you shouldn't touch all 3 nodes at once as we discussed before, otherwise it defeats the whole point of upgrading one node at a time. if you end up in a condition where node 1 has not started and you are stopping 2 and 3, then something else is wrong.  >  > AFAICT, none of the ideas discussed so far help at all with the third > concern.

Well, you will need to make sure that there are no errors in pcs status before starting the upgrade, if there are you would need to clear them. Then do the upgrade and wait say 5/10 minutes and see if there are other errors, but it's very hairy. Also, even if a service start (let say nova-api), you still don't know if that daemon is actually working properly and responding to api request.  From a pacemaker perspective the service is started tho.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1261921#c33)  Alexander Chuzhoy    2015-09-28 22:13:54 UTC  ``` FailedQA:  Environment: openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-0.8.6-69.el7ost.noarch  Failing based on comments: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264203#c17](show_bug.cgi?id=1264203#c17 "CLOSED ERRATA - rhel-osp-director: \"openstack overcloud update stack --templates -e <yaml> -i overcloud\" failed.")

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1261697#c0)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-10 02:00:14 UTC  ``` A flaw was discovered in the pipeline ordering of the swift staticweb middleware in the swiftproxy config generated from the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates. The staticweb middleware was incorrectly configured before keystone and under some conditions may allow unauthenticated access to private data.   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Christian Schwede and Emilien Macchi of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1261697#c2)  Garth Mollett    2015-09-10 02:15:40 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1261499](show_bug.cgi?id=1261499) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1261697#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-08 12:18:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 7.0 Director/Manager for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:1862 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1862](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015%3A1862)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1261697#c6)  Garth Mollett    2015-10-19 05:58:01 UTC  ```  Created openstack-tripleo-heat-templates tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1272860](show_bug.cgi?id=1272860 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-5271 openstack-tripleo-heat-templates: unsafe pipeline ordering of swift staticweb middleware [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

Subject: [PATCH] Put staticweb middleware after keystoneauth in proxy pipeline
The staticweb middleware needs to be put after authentication
middlewares to ensure correct functionality as documented in
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/middleware.html#staticweb
Without this Swift sends a HTML response even if the request was done
using a X-Auth-Token. This might result in a faulty handling of the response on
the client side; for example, "swift stat containername" would report an empty,
private container, while the container might actually be public readable with
data stored in it.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform director provides the
facilities for deploying and monitoring a private or public
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform.

A flaw was discovered in the pipeline ordering of OpenStack Object
Storage's staticweb middleware in the swiftproxy configuration generated
from the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package (OpenStack director).
The staticweb middleware was incorrectly configured before the Identity
Service, and under some conditions an attacker could use this flaw to gain
unauthenticated access to private data. (CVE-2015-5271)

This issue was discovered by Christian Schwede and Emilien Macchi of
Red Hat.

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements.
