  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-5271",
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the pipeline ordering of OpenStack Object Storage's staticweb middleware in the swiftproxy configuration generated from the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package (OpenStack director). The staticweb middleware was incorrectly configured before the Identity Service, and under some conditions an attacker could use this flaw to gain unauthenticated access to private data.",
    "affected_component": "openstack-tripleo-heat-templates",
    "root_cause": "The `staticweb` middleware in the Swift proxy pipeline was incorrectly placed before the `keystone` authentication middleware.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect middleware pipeline ordering",
       "Lack of proper authentication enforcement for static web content"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated access to private data. When the staticweb middleware is enabled, it is incorrectly configured before the keystone auth middleware, reporting containers with enabled staticweb listings to be empty and private while in fact being public accessible. A possible unrecognized information leak might be the result.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct access to the Swift API"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "No authentication needed, if staticweb middleware is enabled, the content could be accessed without credentials."
  }
