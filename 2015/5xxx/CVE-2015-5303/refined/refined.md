{
    "CVE-2015-5303": {
        "Description": "It was discovered that the director's NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret parameter remained specified at the default value of 'unset'. This value is used by OpenStack Networking to sign instance headers; if unchanged, an attacker knowing the shared secret could use this flaw to spoof OpenStack Networking metadata requests.",
        "Root cause": "The `NeutronMetadataProxySharedSecret` parameter was not being set during deployment, leaving it at the default 'unset' value.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Insecure default configuration",
            "Predictable shared secret"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker knowing the shared secret could use this flaw to spoof OpenStack Networking metadata requests.",
        "Attack vector": "Network-based, requiring knowledge of the shared secret.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Knowledge of the default shared secret."
    }
