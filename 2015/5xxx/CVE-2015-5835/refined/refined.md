The provided document contains details about multiple vulnerabilities fixed in iOS 9, but it **does** include information about **CVE-2015-5835**.

**CVE-2015-5835**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed that allowed a malicious app to intercept URL scheme communication between apps.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for inter-app URL scheme communication.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application can intercept communication between other applications.
*   **Attack vectors**: A malicious app installed on the device can intercept URL scheme communications intended for other apps.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious application needs to be installed on the targeted iOS device. The attacker does not need to be on the same network, nor have any special privileges besides having an installed application.
*   **Mitigation**: This was mitigated by displaying a dialog when a URL scheme is used for the first time.
