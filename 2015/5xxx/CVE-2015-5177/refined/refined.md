Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a double-free flaw present in the `SLPDProcessMessage()` function within the OpenSLP (Service Location Protocol) implementation. This occurs due to incorrect handling of memory allocation and deallocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:** The core issue is that memory allocated for the `recvbuf` (received buffer) is freed twice under specific conditions, leading to a double-free vulnerability. This occurs in two places: once within `SLPDKnownDAAdd` and potentially again in the `SLPDProcessMessage` function if the errorcode is not 0 after processing a `SLP_FUNCT_DAADVERT` or `SLP_FUNCT_SRVREG` message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the double-free vulnerability leads to a crash of the `slpd` (OpenSLP daemon) service. This causes a denial of service, making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted SLP packet (e.g., a malformed DAAdvert message) to the vulnerable `slpd` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the machine running the vulnerable `slpd` service.
*   **Crafted SLP Message:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted SLP message that triggers the double-free condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `openslp` version 1.2.1, specifically impacting Debian oldstable (wheezy), stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions.
*   Upstream fixed the issue in 2011, and patches were backported to the Debian packages.
*   Red Hat also acknowledged the issue, noting that it affects EPEL 5, but the bug was marked as "WONTFIX" due to the affected version not being actively maintained.

In summary, CVE-2015-5177 is a double-free vulnerability in OpenSLP's `SLPDProcessMessage` function that allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service by sending a specially crafted SLP message.
