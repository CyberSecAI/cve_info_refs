### Learn More

### Product Overview

With the Eventbrite Tickets plugin, you can connect your WordPress calendar with the leading ticket platform and drive sales for your events.

Eventbrite Tickets gives you the power to create and manage Eventbrite events and tickets right from your WordPress dashboard.

You can also display Eventbrite tickets on your site and import events from your Eventbrite account.

Last, but not least, you can even automate imports from your Eventbrite Account so that your Calendar is always up to date. A great way to speed up your workflow!

### More Information

Eventbrite Tickets is a WordPress plugin created and supported by The Events Calendar team using the Eventbrite API. Eventbrite is not responsible for the functionality or support of the product. You will need a [free Eventbrite account](http://www.eventbrite.com/r/etp) to use this plugin.

**Please note that Eventbrite Tickets does not support recurring events** because of limitations with the Eventbrite API. That means a recurring event with Events Calendar Pro will not sync as a recurring event in Eventbrite, and vice versa.

A couple of other things to consider with Eventbrite:

* The Eventbrite API only supports PayPal and Google Pay for transactions.
* Eventbrite often collects a percentage-based fee on sold tickets.

For more information, check out our [Knowledgebase articles](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/product/eventbrite-tickets/) and our [Getting Started guide](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/guide/getting-started-with-eventbrite-tickets/). Our [demo site](https://demo.theeventscalendar.com) is great place to see Eventbrite Tickets (and our other add-ons) in action. If you have any other questions, [contact us](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/k/pre-sales-questions/) and we’ll be happy to help.

# Release: Eventbrite Tickets 3.10.2

* [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/category/release-notes/the-events-calendar/)

Jul 09 2015

Good afternoon, folks! As we wind down another Thursday, I wanted to share an update on a release we just pushed: **Eventbrite Tickets 3.10.2**is officially live and ready for public consumption.

Though only changing one line of code, this release addresses a potential XSS vulnerability impacting the Event Import page, which was brought to our attention earlier today by Tom Adams at [DXW Security](https://security.dxw.com/). All users are encouraged to update to 3.10.2 whenever convenient.

Thanks to Tom for the report, and to our devs for getting this patch out the same day of its report. If you have further questions…the support team is [standing by at the forums](http://theeventscalendar.com/support/forums/) and ready to help.

## Advisory:

# Reflected XSS in The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets allows unauthenticated users to do almost anything an admin can

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 9, 2015

This plugin contains a Reflected XSS vulnerability (views/eventbrite/import-eventbrite-events.php line 14).

This allows an attacker to hijack pages on the site by adding Javascript code into them. For example, an attacker could construct a fake login page on your website and steal an administrator’s password when they log in. There would be almost no way to tell that this was happening.

If an administrator can be tricked into clicking on a link controlled by the attacker, then an attacker would also be able to automate anything an admin could do, for example creating and deleting user accounts and creating and deleting content. There would be almost no way to tell that this was happening, and it is easy to make these links very convincing.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 5.8 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=tribe\_events&page=import-eventbrite-events&error=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
