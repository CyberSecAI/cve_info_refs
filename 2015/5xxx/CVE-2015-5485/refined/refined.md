Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `views/eventbrite/import-eventbrite-events.php` file, specifically line 14, of The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `error` parameter in the URL when importing events from Eventbrite. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is reflected back to the user's browser when the page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Page Hijacking:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be used to hijack pages on the vulnerable website.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could create a fake login page and steal administrator credentials when they attempt to log in.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** By tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link, an attacker could automate any action an admin can perform, such as creating or deleting user accounts and content.
*   **Silent Exploitation:** The attacks can be difficult to detect, as the malicious code is executed within the context of the legitimate website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in the `error` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user (preferably an administrator) into clicking on the crafted malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on a malicious link.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted URL to the victim.
