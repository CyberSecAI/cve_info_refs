    "Description": "The provided content indicates that CVE-2015-5201 is related to a vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) where disabling Spice ticketing and performing a VM suspend and restore could allow an authentication bypass.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "When vdsm (Virtual Desktop Server Manager) is run with the `-spice disable-ticketing` option, and a virtual machine is suspended and then restored, any remote user can connect to the console without needing to authenticate.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a virtual machine's console by connecting without authenticating, potentially leading to complete control over the VM.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access to the affected virtualized environment."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker must have network connectivity to the host running the vulnerable virtual machine.",
        "The attacker needs to know that the hypervisor was started with the -spice disable-ticketing option."
    ],
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is related to the interaction between libvirt and vdsm when Spice ticketing is disabled. Patches were backported into the 7.1.z versions of libvirt. The fix was delivered via the rhev-hypervisor package, included in Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2015-2527 (RHEA-2015:2527). The related bugzilla entries are 1253882, 1254661, 1273144 and 1282346."
