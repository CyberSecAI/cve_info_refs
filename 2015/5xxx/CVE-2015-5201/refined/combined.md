| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1282346#c0)  Huijuan Zhao    2015-11-16 08:10:20 UTC  ``` Description of problem: rhev-hypervisor-6-6.7-20151112.0 involved the wrong qemu-kvm-rhev package. It should involve qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.2 which released on October 22, 2015.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): rhev-hypervisor-6-6.7-20151112.0 qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.1.x86_64  How reproducible: 100% QA Whiteboard: regression  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Clean install rhev-hypervisor-6-6.7-20151112.0 2. Check the qemu-kvm-rhev package  Actual results: 1. # rpm -qa |grep qemu-kvm-rhev    qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.1.x86_64   Expected results: 1. It should qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.2.x86_64 which released on October 22, 2015.  Additional info: No such issue on rhev-hypervisor-6-6.7-20151015.1, so it is regression issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1282346#c4)  cshao    2015-11-18 05:57:07 UTC  ``` Test version: rhev-hypervisor6-6.7-20151117.0 ovirt-node-3.2.3-28.el6.noarch  # rpm -qa | grep qemu-kvm-rhev qemu-kvm-rhev-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.2.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-tools-0.12.1.2-2.479.el6_7.2.x86_64  The qemu-kvm-rhev version is correct, so the bug is fixed, change bug status to VERIFIED.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1282346#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-01 19:35:46 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
