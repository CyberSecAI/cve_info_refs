  "CVE-2015-5576": {
    "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.241 and 19.x before 19.0.0.185 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.521 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.190, Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.190, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 19.0.0.190 do not properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unspecified vectors.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper restriction of memory address discovery.",
      "Weaknesses": "Insufficient restrictions on memory address discovery, leading to ASLR bypass.",
      "Impact": "Bypass of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), making it easier for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.",
      "Attack vectors": "Unspecified vectors that lead to memory address discovery.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Requires the ability to make the Flash Player reveal memory addresses, likely through manipulation of Flash content."
