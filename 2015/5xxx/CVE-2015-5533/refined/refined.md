Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5533:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `cpd_keep_month` HTTP POST parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application does not check the origin of HTTP requests, which enables an attacker to use a CSRF vector to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL query execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries within the application's database.
- **Information disclosure:** Sensitive information can be extracted from the database.
- **Website compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/options-general.php` with a malicious `cpd_keep_month` parameter.
- **CSRF:** An attacker can use CSRF to trick an authenticated administrator into triggering the malicious POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrative privileges (for direct exploitation):** A remote user with administrative privileges is needed to directly send a malicious request to the vulnerable page and exploit the SQL Injection.
- **CSRF exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to trigger the malicious request through an administrative user.
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the "Count Per Day" WordPress plugin, versions 3.4 and possibly earlier.
- The vendor patched the vulnerability in version 3.4.1.
- The exploit example provided uses a DNS exfiltration technique which is specific to databases hosted on Windows systems.
- The vulnerable parameter is `cpd_keep_month`, which is used to determine how long to keep monthly data.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to inject SQL to exfiltrate data using `load_file` function in MySQL.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description which usually lacks exploit details and specific vulnerable parameter information.
