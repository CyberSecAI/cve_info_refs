A medium security issue was discovered for cordova-plugin-file-transfer plugin. We are releasing version `1.3.0` of `cordova-plugin-file-transfer` to address this security issue. We recommend that all applications currently using an older version of this plugin to upgrade as soon as possible.

---

You can update the plugin by removing it, and then re-adding it.

E.g. To update your file-transfer plugin:

```
cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-file-transfer --save
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file-transfer --save

```

The security issue is CVE-2015-5204.

For your convenience, the text of the CVE is included here:

CVE-2015-5204: HTTP header injection vulerability in Apache Cordova File
Transfer Plugin for Android

Severity:
Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android File Transfer Plugin (1.2.1 and below)

Description:
Android applications built with the Cordova framework that use the File
Transfer Plugin can have the HTTP headers set by that plugin be manipulated
by the filename being uploaded. This allows for for cookies to be forged
by the Cordova application, or for the file payload to be replaced in some
situations. Remotely hosted applications and applications developed with
Cordova that allow the user to manually enter the filename are
especially vulnerable to this issue.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 1.3.0
or higher of the Cordova File Transfer Plugin and rebuild their
applications. This plugin now conforms with RFC-2616 and no longer allows
non-ASCII characters and control characters in header names or values.
Any non-ASCII
characters will be removed from the header. Developers should be aware,
and encode these
characters before adding the values to the header.
