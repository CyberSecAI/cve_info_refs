Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTTP headers by the Apache Cordova File Transfer Plugin for Android. Specifically, the plugin allowed the manipulation of HTTP headers through the filename being uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Header Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary characters, including non-ASCII and control characters, into the HTTP headers by manipulating the filename during file upload. This was possible because the plugin didn't properly validate or sanitize the filename input.
- **Lack of RFC-2616 Compliance:** The plugin did not adhere to RFC-2616, which specifies the allowed characters in HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cookie Forgery:** Attackers could forge cookies by injecting malicious header values, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user sessions or other sensitive information.
- **File Payload Replacement:** In certain scenarios, the attacker might be able to replace the intended file payload with a malicious one.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Filename Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the filename provided during a file upload operation.
- **Remotely Hosted Applications:** Applications that are hosted remotely were especially vulnerable.
- **User-Entered Filenames:** Applications that allow users to manually enter the filename were also more susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the filename used during a file transfer operation using the vulnerable Cordova plugin. This could be through direct user input or by manipulating data submitted to the application.
- No specific capabilities or position other than those described above are mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix implemented in version 1.3.0 of the plugin addressed this vulnerability by ensuring compliance with RFC-2616, which disallows non-ASCII and control characters in header names and values. Any such characters in the filename were removed before being added to the header.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Muneaki Nishimura (Sony Digital Network Applications, Inc.).
