## N-Able RSMWinService contains hard coded security constants allowing decryption of domain administrator password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#912036

Original Release Date: 2015-07-20 | Last Revised: 2015-07-20

---

### Overview

SolarWinds N-Able N-Central is an agent-based enterprise support and management solution. N-Able N-Central contains several hard-coded encryption constants in the web interface that allow decryption of the password when combined.

### Description

| [**CWE-547**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/547.html)**: Use of Hard-coded, Security-relevant Constants**  N-Able N-Central's RSM service stores the N-Able domain administrator account password in an encrypted (AES128) format. According to the reporter, however, the encrypted password is accessible by any authenticated local or remote user from within from the RSM web page source. The credentials are also available in an encrypted format via local RSM configuration files accessible by any local user with rights to browse program files. The encryption keys as well as other parameters needed for decryption are hard-coded and may be extracted from the N-Able RSM software stored on the local users system. An attacker can use this information to decrypt and obtain the domain administrator password used by the N-Able software.The reporter states that N-Able N-Central version 9.5.0 is vulnerable to these problems, and version 9.0 through 9.4 may also be vulnerable.The CERT/CC has been unable to confirm these vulnerabilities with SolarWinds. |
| --- |

### Impact

| According to the reporter, a remote attacker with domain user credentials or access to RSM files on an installed system can obtain domain administrator access. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**According to the reporter, N-Able Support Manager Build 178 and N-Able N-Central Agent version 9.5.1.4514 or above, or 10.0.0.1722 or above, have addressed remote access to this issue. Users are encouraged to update N-Able software as soon as possible.The CERT/CC has been unable to confirm with SolarWinds that this update fully addresses these issues. |
