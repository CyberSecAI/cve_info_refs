{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hard-coded encryption keys and parameters within N-Able RSM software.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of hard-coded, security-relevant constants (CWE-547). The domain administrator password is encrypted using AES128, but the keys and other parameters needed for decryption are hardcoded.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker with domain user credentials or access to RSM files on an installed system can decrypt the domain administrator password, gaining domain administrator access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The encrypted password and the hard-coded encryption constants are accessible via the RSM web page source and local RSM configuration files. An attacker can extract the hard-coded values and use them to decrypt the domain administrator password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs either domain user credentials for remote access or local access to the system where the N-Able RSM software is installed to read configuration files. The attacker also needs the ability to extract the hard-coded encryption constants from the N-Able RSM software."
