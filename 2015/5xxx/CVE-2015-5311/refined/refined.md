Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5311:

**Root Cause:**
- A bug in the packet parsing code of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server was discovered using `afl-fuzz`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the PowerDNS Authoritative Server parses incoming DNS packets. Specifically, specially crafted query packets can trigger an assertion error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the termination of the `pdns_server` process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
- If the server is run within a guardian process or a supervisor (like supervisord or systemd), the service will be automatically restarted. However, service will still be degraded until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted query packets to the affected PowerDNS Authoritative Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted DNS query packets to the targeted PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.

**Affected Versions:**
- PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions 3.4.4 through 3.4.6 are vulnerable.
- PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions 3.3.x and 3.4.7 and later are not affected.
- The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.
