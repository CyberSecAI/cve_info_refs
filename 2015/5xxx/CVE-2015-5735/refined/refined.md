Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the FortiClient drivers "mdare64_48.sys", "mdare32_48.sys", "mdare32_52.sys", and "mdare64_52.sys".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The drivers expose an IOCTL (0x226108) that allows an attacker to call the `ZwEnumerateValueKey` function and write its output to an arbitrary memory location. This is a write-what-where condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain code execution with kernel privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local exploitation. An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable drivers through the exposed IOCTL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system with the vulnerable FortiClient drivers installed.  They do not need administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
