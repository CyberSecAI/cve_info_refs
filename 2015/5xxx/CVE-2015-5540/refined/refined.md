  "CVE-2015-5540": {
    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.232 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.508 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.199, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.199, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.199 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5127, CVE-2015-5130, CVE-2015-5134, CVE-2015-5539, CVE-2015-5550, CVE-2015-5551, CVE-2015-5556, CVE-2015-5557, CVE-2015-5559, CVE-2015-5561, CVE-2015-5563, CVE-2015-5564, and CVE-2015-5565.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in the `XML.childNodes` object within Adobe Flash Player. Specifically, when a watch is set on the `childNodes` object of an XML object and the XML object is manipulated to trigger enumeration of its child nodes, the watch function executes. If this watch function deletes all child nodes, the buffer containing those nodes is deleted. However, the original function continues execution attempting to access the deleted buffer which leads to the use-after-free.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution due to the ability of an attacker to control pointers within the childnodes array in ActionScript.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a specially crafted SWF file that, when loaded by the vulnerable Adobe Flash Player, triggers the vulnerability. This can occur when a user visits a website hosting the malicious content or is tricked into opening a file containing the malicious code.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious SWF file.  The user needs to execute the SWF file by visiting a webpage or opening a malicious file."
