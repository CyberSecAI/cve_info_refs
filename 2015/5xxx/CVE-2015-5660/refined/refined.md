Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in the `index.php` file of eXtplorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352): The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a logged-in user visits a malicious page, the attacker can force the user's browser to send requests to the vulnerable eXtplorer instance, resulting in unintended operations.
- This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to complete compromise of the server and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker hosts a malicious page that includes forged requests targeting the vulnerable eXtplorer instance.
- A logged-in user, while authenticated to eXtplorer, must visit this malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious page.
- The attacker does not need to have any direct access to the eXtplorer server.
- The attacker needs the victim to be a logged-in user of the vulnerable eXtplorer instance and must trick the user into visiting the malicious page.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability in eXtplorer versions 2.1.7 and earlier, where an attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user by tricking them into visiting a malicious page. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary PHP code and complete system compromise.
