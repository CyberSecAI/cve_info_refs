{
  "CVE-2015-5400": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Squid does not correctly handle CONNECT method peer responses when configured with cache_peer and operating on explicit proxy traffic.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of CONNECT responses from a peer cache, leading to security bypass.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote clients can bypass security restrictions and gain unrestricted access to backend proxies, potentially leading to authentication bypass or unprivileged access to secure resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote clients send a crafted CONNECT request via an explicit proxy configuration using cache_peer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send a CONNECT request through a vulnerable Squid instance configured with a cache peer.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs when Squid is configured with cache_peer to receive CONNECT requests and doesn't properly handle responses from those peers. This flaw is specific to explicit proxy configurations. Successful exploitation allows subsequent requests to be tunneled without proper processing, which can bypass configured security policies."
