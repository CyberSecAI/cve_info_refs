Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2015:2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2015:2
Date: July 06, 2015
Summary: Improper Protection of Alternate Path
Affected versions: Squid 0.x -> 3.5.5
Fixed in version: Squid 3.5.6
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2015\_2.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5400
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Squid configured with cache\_peer and operating on explicit proxy
traffic does not correctly handle CONNECT method peer responses.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
The bug is important because it allows remote clients to bypass
security in an explicit gateway proxy.
However, the bug is exploitable only if you have configured
cache\_peer to receive CONNECT requests.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.5.6.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for stable releases
can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.1:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/squid-3.1-10494.patch
Squid 3.4:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/squid-3.4-13225.patch
Squid 3.5:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13856.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid versions with cache\_peer omitted from squid.conf are
not vulnerable to the problem.
All Squid versions with squid.conf containing
"nonhierarchical\_direct on" are not vulnerable to the problem.
All Squid-3.1 and later with nonhierarchical\_direct omitted from
squid.conf are not vulnerable to the problem.
All other unpatched Squid configured to use a cache\_peer without
the "originserver" option are vulnerable to the problem.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
For Squid-3.0 and older ensure squid.conf contains
"nonhierarchical\_direct on".
For Squid-3.1 and newer remove nonhierarchical\_direct from
squid.conf.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed
list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

message:
Do not blindly forward cache peer CONNECT responses.
Squid blindly forwards cache peer CONNECT responses to clients. This
may break things if the peer responds with something like HTTP 403
(Forbidden) and keeps the connection with Squid open:
- The client application issues a CONNECT request.
- Squid forwards this request to a cache peer.
- Cache peer correctly responds back with a "403 Forbidden".
- Squid does not parse cache peer response and
just forwards it as if it was a Squid response to the client.
- The TCP connections are not closed.
At this stage, Squid is unaware that the CONNECT request has failed. All
subsequent requests on the user agent TCP connection are treated as
tunnelled traffic. Squid is forwarding these requests to the peer on the
TCP connection previously used for the 403-ed CONNECT request, without
proper processing. The additional headers which should have been applied
by Squid to these requests are not applied, and the requests are being
forwarded to the cache peer even though the Squid configuration may
state that these requests must go directly to the origin server.
This fixes Squid to parse cache peer responses, and if an error response
found, respond with "502 Bad Gateway" to the client and close the
connections.

Package        : squid3
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5400
Debian Bug     : 793128

Alex Rousskov of The Measurement Factory discovered that Squid3, a fully
featured web proxy cache, does not correctly handle CONNECT method peer
responses when configured with cache_peer and operating on explicit
proxy traffic. This could allow remote clients to gain unrestricted
access through a gateway proxy to its backend proxy.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

message:
Do not blindly forward cache peer CONNECT responses.
Squid blindly forwards cache peer CONNECT responses to clients. This
may break things if the peer responds with something like HTTP 403
(Forbidden) and keeps the connection with Squid open:
- The client application issues a CONNECT request.
- Squid forwards this request to a cache peer.
- Cache peer correctly responds back with a "403 Forbidden".
- Squid does not parse cache peer response and
just forwards it as if it was a Squid response to the client.
- The TCP connections are not closed.
At this stage, Squid is unaware that the CONNECT request has failed. All
subsequent requests on the user agent TCP connection are treated as
tunnelled traffic. Squid is forwarding these requests to the peer on the
TCP connection previously used for the 403-ed CONNECT request, without
proper processing. The additional headers which should have been applied
by Squid to these requests are not applied, and the requests are being
forwarded to the cache peer even though the Squid configuration may
state that these requests must go directly to the origin server.
This fixes Squid to parse cache peer responses, and if an error response
found, respond with "502 Bad Gateway" to the client and close the
connections.

Short answer is no.

Lonng answer:

Since the only reference I can find for AllowTcpForwarding is TLS/SSL
related it looks like you are falling into the common misbelief that
HTTP CONNECT messages mean HTTPS (TLS).

CONNECT is a generic instruction for the proxy to setup a TCP tunnel.
Once such a tunnel exists it can be used for any TCP based protocol.
HTTP over TLS is just one usage

So no, the breakage happens at the plain-text HTTP layer below any TLS
that might be used to secure whatever the tunnelled protocol is.

(CVE-2016-2569, CVE-2016-2570, CVE-2016-2571, CVE-2016-2572, bsc#968392,
bsc#968393, bsc#968394, bsc#968395)
- CVE-2016-3947: Buffer overrun issue in pinger ICMPv6 processing.
(bsc#973782)
- CVE-2015-5400: Improper protection of alternate path. (bsc#938715)
- CVE-2015-3455: Squid http proxy configured with client-first SSL bumping
did not correctly validate server certificate. (bsc#929493)
- CVE-2016-3948: Fixed denial of service in HTTP Response processing
(bsc#973783)
- CVE-2016-4051: fixes buffer overflow in cachemgr.cgi (bsc#976553)
- CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054: Fixed multiple issues in
ESI processing (bsc#976556)
- CVE-2016-4553: Fixed cache poisoning issue in HTTP Request handling
(bsc#979009)
- CVE-2016-4554: Fixed header smuggling issue in HTTP Request processing
(bsc#979010)
- Fixed multiple Denial of Service issues in ESI Response processing.
(CVE-2016-4555, CVE-2016-4556, bsc#979011, bsc#979008)
Additionally, the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- Fix header size in script unsquid.pl. (bsc#902197)
- Add external helper ext\_session\_acl to package. (bsc#959290)

becoming more popular more CDN servers are producing long lists of IPv6
and IPv4 addresses. If there are not enough paths selected the IPv4 ones
may never be reached.
- squid.init: wait that squid really dies when we kill it on upgrade
instead
of proclaiming its demise prematurely (bnc#963539)

message:
Do not blindly forward cache peer CONNECT responses.
Squid blindly forwards cache peer CONNECT responses to clients. This
may break things if the peer responds with something like HTTP 403
(Forbidden) and keeps the connection with Squid open:
- The client application issues a CONNECT request.
- Squid forwards this request to a cache peer.
- Cache peer correctly responds back with a "403 Forbidden".
- Squid does not parse cache peer response and
just forwards it as if it was a Squid response to the client.
- The TCP connections are not closed.
At this stage, Squid is unaware that the CONNECT request has failed. All
subsequent requests on the user agent TCP connection are treated as
tunnelled traffic. Squid is forwarding these requests to the peer on the
TCP connection previously used for the 403-ed CONNECT request, without
proper processing. The additional headers which should have been applied
by Squid to these requests are not applied, and the requests are being
forwarded to the cache peer even though the Squid configuration may
state that these requests must go directly to the origin server.
This fixes Squid to parse cache peer responses, and if an error response
found, respond with "502 Bad Gateway" to the client and close the
connections.

Subject: Re: Squid HTTP proxy CVE request

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2390 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2390)

#### Description

The FwdState::connectedToPeer method in FwdState.cc in Squid before 3.5.14 and 4.0.x before 4.0.6 does not properly handle SSL handshake errors when built with the --with-openssl option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a plaintext HTTP message.

Subject: Squid HTTP proxy CVE request

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Greetings,

This months release of Squid HTTP proxy, version 3.5.6, contains fixes
for two security issues.

Issue #1:

Due to incorrect handling of peer responses in a hierarchy of 2 or
more proxies remote clients (or scripts run on a client) are able to
gain unrestricted access through a gateway proxy to its backend proxy.

If the two proxies have differing levels of security this could lead
to authentication bypass or unprivileged access to supposedly secure
resources.

<<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13856.p>
atch>

All Squid up to and including 3.5.5 are vulnerable.

(when published the advisory for this will be
<<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2015_2.txt>>)

Issue #2:

This is somewhat more obscure, and I am seeking clarification perhapse
more than assignment.

Squid up to and including 3.5.5 are apparently vulnerable to DoS
attack from malicious clients using repeated TLS renegotiation
messages. This has not been verified as it also seems to require
outdated (0.9.8l and older) OpenSSL libraries.

<<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13849.p>
atch>

CVE-2009-3555 was mentioned by the submitter, but that was clearly
assigned for server-initiated renegotiation. This Squid change is
specifically for the client-initiated renegotiation part of the TLS
protocol flaw.

There may be some relevant CVE already assigned, although I've been
unable to find it. Only CVE-2011-1473 which is for the library itself
and disputed.

So, is server software being assigned specific CVE (or a shared
generic one) for resolving this flaw? Please indicate which CVE Squid
announcements should mention (if any).

Thanks,
Amos Jeffries

We have a few questions about this.

First, we probably don't understand your build process. The only
mentions of the substring "renegotiate" in squid-3.5.6.tar.bz2 are:

    - TLS: Disable client-initiated renegotiation

  #if defined(TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate)
              TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate,
  #endif

  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
  static void
  ssl_info_cb(const SSL *ssl, int where, int ret)
  [ ... ]
  #endif

  configureSslContext
  ...
  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(sslContext, ssl_info_cb);
  #endif

  sslCreateClientContext
  ...
  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(sslContext, ssl_info_cb);
  #endif

The only mention of the substring "renegotiate" in squid-3.5.5.tar.bz2
is:

  #if defined(TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate)
              TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate,
  #endif

<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid> doesn't seem to
mention the change.

How do these 3.5.6 changes disable anything, or serve as one of two
"fixes for two security issues"? Are you just providing a (not widely
documented) build option so that a repackager or end user could define
SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS if desired?

In that situation, we don't believe there should be a CVE ID for the
official Squid distribution, because the change is about adding
functionality in the form of a new, non-default option. If a
repackager decided to build with SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS and
then announce their 3.5.6 renegotiation change as a required security
update for their customers, then the repackager could have a CVE ID.

Second, we don't know what you mean by "CVE-2009-3555 ... was clearly
assigned for server-initiated renegotiation." This statement is,
however, not critical to CVE assignment, so we won't try to start a
discussion of that. The principal reason that CVE-2009-3555 can't be
correct is that CVE-2009-3555 isn't about resource-consumption DoS.

> CVE-2011-1473 which is for the library itself and disputed

Right, in a case where there should be a CVE ID, we feel that the
vulnerable product would be specific server-side code, not a
general-purpose library.

To conclude, if the position of the Squid developers is that
client-initiated renegotiation must be denied (e.g., because it can
lead to resource-consumption DoS, and there aren't any supported Squid
use cases where you feel it's important to let a client renegotiate),
and you have changed your code to take this position by default, then
you can have a CVE ID. Otherwise, we think not.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
