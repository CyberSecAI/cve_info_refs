Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin_messages.php` file of Symantec Web Gateway.
*   The file uses MIME types and file extensions to block potentially dangerous file uploads. However, this method is insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload Handling:** The application relies on easily manipulated MIME types and file extensions for blocking malicious uploads, making it vulnerable to bypass techniques.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of proper validation allows attackers to upload arbitrary files by manipulating the MIME type or file extension.
*   **Loose Sudo Restrictions:** After an attacker uploads a file as the apache user, they can use loose sudo restrictions to gain root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Symantec Web Gateway system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain root privileges by leveraging the loose sudo restrictions after uploading a file as the apache user.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The combination of remote code execution and privilege escalation can lead to a complete compromise of the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality in `admin_messages.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerable file upload functionality, however, authentication can be bypassed via reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks described in the advisory for CVE-2015-5692.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Symantec Web Gateway instance.

**Additional Notes**
* This advisory also mentions CVE-2015-5692, which is related, and involves a reflected XSS to bypass authentication.
*   The advisory mentions that Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2015-5691 describes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Symantec Web Gateway, which, combined with loose sudo restrictions, allows for remote code execution and complete system compromise.
