| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Web Gateway. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, however it can be bypassed via reflected cross-site scripting.  The specific flaw exists within the admin\_messages.php file which relies on mimetypes and file extensions to block potentially dangerous file uploads. An attacker can exploit this condition to upload arbitrary files as the apache user. Due to loose sudo restrictions, an attacker can add the setuid attribute and execute arbitrary code under the context of root. |
