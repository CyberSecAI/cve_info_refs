Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `admin_messages.php` file of Symantec Web Gateway. It incorrectly relies on MIME types and file extensions to block potentially dangerous file uploads.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure File Upload:** The system does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing an attacker to bypass upload restrictions.
    *   **Insufficient Validation:** The reliance on file extensions and MIME types is insufficient, as these can be manipulated by an attacker.
    *   **Loose sudo restrictions:** Attackers can exploit loose sudo restrictions to gain root access.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Authentication bypass is possible through reflected XSS, though it's not directly related to the file upload vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to:
    *   Upload arbitrary files as the `apache` user.
    *   Add the setuid attribute to files.
    *   Execute arbitrary code under the context of `root`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
    *   **File Upload:** Attackers exploit the flawed file upload mechanism.
    *   **XSS:** Initial authentication bypass is done by reflected XSS, followed by file upload
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication Required initially:**  The attacker requires access to the admin interface, but can be bypassed by XSS.
    *   **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.

The advisory provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description by including the affected file name, attack vector, and the ability to achieve root access due to loose sudo restrictions.
