Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-5622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when processing shortcodes within HTML tags. Specifically, the way WordPress parsed shortcodes inside HTML attributes allowed for the injection of malicious code. The parsing of shortcodes was not robust enough, leading to unexpected behaviors. The shortcode parsing logic was manipulated by specially crafted HTML, resulting in unescaped Javascript being embedded in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness was a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript could be injected through specially crafted shortcodes within HTML tags.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The shortcode processing logic failed to properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Compromise:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to compromise the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with Contributor or Author roles (lower-level roles) could potentially escalate their privileges by injecting malicious code that would execute when an administrator views the affected page or post.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** The attacker could steal sensitive information, as the malicious script would run in the context of a logged-in administratorâ€™s session.
*   **Server-side Code Execution:** In more severe scenarios, the attacker could leverage the XSS to potentially execute server-side code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Shortcodes:** Attackers could insert malicious code via specifically formatted HTML containing JavaScript in a page or post using the HTML edit mode.
*  **HTML Attributes:** The vulnerability resided in the parsing of shortcodes within HTML attributes, allowing for XSS injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needed a user account with at least Contributor or Author privileges to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcodes. However, in certain configurations unauthenticated users could also be able to post or edit page content.
*   **Understanding of Shortcode Syntax:** An attacker would need knowledge of the specific shortcode parsing logic, and how to manipulate it, in order to inject their malicious payloads.
*   **HTML knowledge:** The attacker must have the ability to use HTML edit mode, and craft specific HTML tags with malicious JavaScript within.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was demonstrated with the following code snippet:

```html
<a href="[caption code=">]</a><a title=" onmouseover=alert('test')  ">link</a>
```

The shortcode processing would convert this into:

```html
<a href="</a><a title=" onmouseover=alert('test')  ">link</a>
```

This shows how the shortcode processing allowed an `onmouseover` event handler to be injected into the title attribute, leading to XSS. This code would execute when the administrator mouses over the element.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was patched in WordPress 4.2.3 by implementing a more robust HTML tag filter for shortcodes, and ensuring proper sanitization of attribute values before processing the shortcodes. This included functions to sanitize the shortcode output using KSES and improvements in how shortcodes are handled within HTML elements.
