  "cveId": "CVE-2015-5764",
  "related": true,
  "info": "The vulnerability is a URI spoofing issue in Apple Safari, which also affects iOS. Multiple user interface inconsistencies allowed a malicious website to display an arbitrary URL. Specifically, Safari would incorrectly display the address bar after a 302 redirect from a regular URL to a 'data:text/html' URL, causing a mismatch between the displayed URL and the actual content of the page. This issue is related to caching problems in Safari.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Caching problem in Safari's handling of 302 redirects to data:text/html URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "URI spoofing",
      "User interface inconsistencies",
      "Incorrect URL display",
      "Lack of proper validation of cached URLs"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious website could spoof its URL in the address bar, potentially tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate site. This can lead to phishing attacks or other forms of user interface spoofing, where users might enter sensitive information into a fake site thinking it is real.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious website",
      "Exploiting a website with an open redirect",
       "Manipulating HTTP 302 redirects",
      "Using data:text/html URLs"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to host a website that can redirect to a 'data:text/html' URL or control a vulnerable OAuth server which allows registration of such URLs as redirect URIs. This could be combined with an open redirect to achieve the spoofing effect."
