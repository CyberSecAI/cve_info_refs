## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

```
tl;dr Apple Safari for OS X was prone to URI spoofing vulnerability  (and more general a user interface spoofing).
Apple released security updates for Safari 9<<https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205265>> on OS X and assigned CVE-2015-5764.
Accidentally this vulnerability was also present in iOS.

Instant demo
In Safari up to 8.0.8 :

  *   go to <https://asanso.github.io/CVE-2015-5764/file0.html>
  *   click "click me!"
  *   notice the address bar being "data:text/html,%3CH1%3EHi!!%3C/H1%3E"
  *   go back using the browser button
  *   click "click me!"
  *   notice the address bar being <http://www.intothesymmetry.com/CVE-2015-5764/file0.php> !!!!

You can find the details in <http://intothesymmetry.blogspot.it/2015/09/apple-safari-uri-spoofing-cve-2015-5764.html>

The [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") response [status code](/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes "List of HTTP status codes") **302 Found** is a common way of performing [URL redirection](/wiki/URL_redirection "URL redirection"). The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC [1945](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945)) initially defined this code, and gave it the description phrase "Moved Temporarily" rather than "Found".

An HTTP response with this status code will additionally provide a [URL](/wiki/URL "URL") in the header field [Location](/wiki/HTTP_location "HTTP location"). This is an invitation to the [user agent](/wiki/User_agent "User agent") (e.g. a web browser) to make a second, otherwise identical, request to the new URL specified in the location field. The end result is a redirection to the new URL.

Many web browsers implemented this code in a manner that violated this standard, changing the request type of the new request to [GET](/wiki/HTTP_GET_request "HTTP GET request"), regardless of the type employed in the original request (e.g. [POST](/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29 "POST (HTTP)")).[[1]](#cite_note-1) For this reason, HTTP/1.1 (RFC [2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)) added the new status codes [303](/wiki/HTTP_303 "HTTP 303") and [307](/wiki/HTTP_307 "HTTP 307") to disambiguate between the two behaviours, with 303 mandating the change of request type to GET, and 307 preserving the request type as originally sent. Despite the greater clarity provided by this disambiguation, the 302 code is still employed in web frameworks to preserve compatibility with browsers that do not implement the HTTP/1.1 specification.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

As a consequence, RFC [7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231) (the update of RFC [2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)) changes the definition to allow user agents to rewrite POST to GET.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Website that poses as another website, often allowing a malicious computer attack

|  | This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(June 2022)* |
| --- | --- |

A **spoofed URL** involves one [website](/wiki/Website "Website") masquerading as another, often leveraging vulnerabilities in web browser technology to facilitate a malicious computer attack. These attacks are particularly effective against computers that lack up-to-date security patches. Alternatively, some spoofed URLs are crafted for satirical purposes.

In such an attack scenario, an unsuspecting [computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer") user visits a website and observes a familiar [URL](/wiki/URL "URL"), like http://www.wikipedia.org, in the address bar. However, unbeknownst to them, the information they input is being directed to a completely different location, usually monitored by an information thief. When a fraudulent website requests sensitive information, it's referred to as [phishing](/wiki/Phishing "Phishing").

These fraudulent [websites](/wiki/Website "Website") often entice users through [emails](/wiki/Email "Email") or [hyperlinks](/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink").

In a different variation, a website might resemble the original but is, in reality, a parody. These instances are generally harmless and conspicuously distinct from the genuine sites, as they typically do not [exploit](/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29 "Exploit (computer security)") [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") vulnerabilities.

Another avenue for these [exploits](/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29 "Exploit (computer security)") involves redirects within a host's file, rerouting traffic from legitimate sites to an alternate [IP](/wiki/IP_address "IP address") associated with the spoofed URL.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Cyber security

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spoofed_URL&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Cyber security")]

[Spoofing](/wiki/IP_address_spoofing "IP address spoofing") is the act of deception or hoaxing.[[2]](#cite_note-2) [URLs](/wiki/URLs "URLs") are the address of a resource (as a document or website) on the Internet that consists of a communications protocol followed by the name or address of a computer on the network and that often includes additional locating information (as directory and file names).[[3]](#cite_note-3) Simply, a spoofed URL is a web address that illuminates an immense amount of deception through its ability to appear as an original site, despite it not being one. In order to prevent falling victim to the prevalent scams stemmed from the spoofed URLs, major [software](/wiki/Software "Software") companies have come forward and advised techniques to detect and prevent spoofed URLs.

## Prevention

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spoofed_URL&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Prevention")]

Spoofed [URLs](/wiki/URL "URL"), a universal defining identity for [phishing](/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") scams, pose a serious threat to end-users and commercial institutions. [Email](/wiki/Email "Email") continues to be the favorite vehicle to perpetrate such scams mainly due to its widespread use combined with the ability to easily spoof them.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Several approaches, both generic and specialized, have been proposed to address this problem. However, phishing techniques, growing in ingenuity as well as sophistication, render these solutions weak. In order to prevent users from future victimization stemmed from a spoofed URL, [Internet](/wiki/Internet "Internet") [vigilantes](/wiki/Vigilantes "Vigilantes") have published numerous tips to help users identify a spoof.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Firefox_phishing_alert.jpg)](/wiki/File%3AFirefox_phishing_alert.jpg)

Firefox phishing alert

The most common are: using authentication based on key exchange between the machines on your [network](/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), using an access control list to deny private [IP addresses](/wiki/IP_addresses "IP addresses") on your downstream interface, implementing [filters](/wiki/Internet_filter "Internet filter") of both inbound and outbound traffic, configuring [routers](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)") and switches if they support such configuration, to reject packets originating from outside the local network that claim to originate from within, and enable [encryption](/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") sessions in the router so that trusted hosts that are outside your network can securely communicate with your local hosts.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Ultimately, protection comes from the individual user. Keeping up with new spoofing techniques or scams will readily allow one to identify a scam and most importantly keep information secure and personal.

Spoofed URL contributing to PayPal phishing scam

### Susceptible targets

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spoofed_URL&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Susceptible targets")]

[PayPal](/wiki/PayPal "PayPal"), an [e-commerce](/wiki/E-commerce "E-commerce") business allows money transactions to be made through the Internet and is a common target for spoofed URLs. This [forgery](/wiki/Forgery "Forgery") of a legitimate PayPal website allows [hackers](/wiki/Hacker_%28term%29 "Hacker (term)") to gain personal and financial information and thus, steal money through fraud. Along with spoof or fake emails that appear with generic greetings, misspellings, and a false sense of urgency, spoofed URLs are an easy way for hackers to violate one’s PayPal privacy. For example, www.paypalsecure.com, includes the name, but is a spoofed URL designed to deceive. Remember to always log into PayPal through a new window [browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") and never log in through email. In the case that you do receive a suspected spoofed URL, forward the entire email to spoof@PayPal.com to help prevent the URL from tricking other PayPal users.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## Common crimes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spoofed_URL&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Common crimes")]

A major [crime](/wiki/Crime "Crime") associated with spoofed URLs is [identity theft](/wiki/Identity_theft "Identity theft"). The thief will create a [website](/wiki/Website "Website") very similar in appearance to that of a popular site, then when a user accesses the spoofed URL, they can inadvertently give the thief their [credit card](/wiki/Credit_card "Credit card") and personal details. Their spoofed URLs might use “too good to be true” prices to lure more and more looking for a good deal. Crimes like these happen quite often, and most frequently during the festive holidays and other heavy online shopping periods of the year.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

Another crime associated with spoofed URLs is setting up a fake anti-malware software. An example of this would be [Ransomware](/wiki/Ransomware "Ransomware"), fake anti-malware software that locks up important files for the computer to run, and forces the user to pay a ransom to get the files back. If the user refuses to pay after a certain period of time, the Ransomware will delete the files from the computer, essentially making the computer unusable. Ads for these programs usually appear on popular websites, such as dating sites or social media sites like [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") and [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"). They can also come in the form of attachments to emails.
[Phishing](/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") scams are also another major way that users can get tricked into scams (see below).

## Phishing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spoofed_URL&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Phishing")]

[Phishing](/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") is a [scam](/wiki/Scam "Scam") by which an [e-mail](/wiki/E-mail "E-mail") user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly.[[8]](#cite_note-8) Phishing is the action of fraudsters sending an email to an individual, hoping to seek private information used for identity theft, by falsely asserting to be a reputable legal business. Phishing is performed through emails containing a spoofed URL, which links them to a website. Since it usually appears in the form on an email, it is crucial to not rely just on the address in the “from” field in order to prevent phishing. Computer users should also look out for spelling mistakes within the website's URLs, as this is another common sign to look out for in a phishing email.[[9]](#cite_note-9) The website whose URLs are in the e-mails requests individuals to enter personal information so businesses can update it in their system. This information often includes passwords, credit card numbers, social security, and bank account numbers. In turn, the email recipients are giving these fake businesses their information the real businesses already have.

Well this looks a clear caching problem to me, right :) ?

# The Introduction (Oldie but goldie)

Several months ago (almost a year!!) I was reading the great book written by [lcamtuf](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/) (aka Michal Zalewski) named [The Tangled Web](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/) .  I know, I know I was a bit late for the party :)

Said that, this book contained a really interesting Chapter (for the record Chapter 10) that is dedicated almost entirely to pseudo-URLs such as *(about:*, *javascript:*, or *data:*).

As for almost all the parts of this book I wanted to try what it was written and I started a bit to poke around.  The followers of this blog know that I kind of like [to "play" with OAuth](http://intothesymmetry.blogspot.it/search/label/oauth). Hence I combined the two things and started to see what I could do.

# The Issue

The first issue I found was the one mentioned in the Instant demo section above.

Now,  in order to understand the issue we need to look at the code of <https://asanso.github.io/CVE-2015-5764/file0.html>

<html>
<a href="http://www.intothesymmetry.com/CVE-2015-5764/file0.php">click me! </a>
</html>

As you can see this is simply pointing to a PHP page in my website (http://www.intothesymmetry.com/CVE-2015-5764/file0.php). So let's take a look at it:

<?php
header("Location: data:text/html,<H1>Hi!!</H1>");
exit();
?>

This is simply an [HTTP 302 redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302) to data:text/html,data:text/html,<H1>Hi!!</H1>

Now when clicking at the link all the browser but Safari showed properly the address bar being data:text/html,%3CH1%3EHi!!%3C/H1%3E . Safari instead from the second visit onward would show the original website namely http://www.intothesymmetry.com/CVE-2015-5764/file0.php but with the HTML contained in the data:text/html pseudo-URI!!!

Well well this looks like an [URI spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofed_URL) according to my book ;)

[Safari was not unkown to this kind of vulnerability](http://thehackernews.com/2015/05/safari-url-spoofing.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheHackersNews+%28The+Hackers+News+-+Security+Blog%29) in 2015, same as [Google Chrome](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jun/108)

# The Vulnerability(ies)

At this point your question can easily be why on earth should exists a website that allow an attacker to manipulate a 302 redirect versus a data:text/html URI and how did you find this weird vulnerability  :D ? The answer is: because of some  [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) implementations!!!

One of steps in order to obtain an OAuth client is to register a client application providing client name and a list of redirect\_uri.

<snip>

//SHAMELESS SELF ADVERTISEMENT

If you are not too much familiar with OAuth 2.0 [here](https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action) you can find a book on OAuth that [Justin Richer](https://twitter.com/zer0n1ne) and myself have been writing on the subject.

</snip>

Below a  little reminder on how a typical OAuth flow would look like

[![](http://freecontent.manning.com/wp-content/uploads/OAuth2_animation01.gif)](http://freecontent.manning.com/wp-content/uploads/OAuth2_animation01.gif)

It turns out that exists some OAuth Autorization server that allows the registration of redirect\_uri of the form of data:text/html. One example is (was as Facebook fixed this in the meantime) [Moves](https://dev.moves-app.com/docs/authentication) on of Facebook acquisitions

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF-fj3VRx1HbfQgB8E_E2XUOowWbaOJP04jy9zFbzx9ABzktnlvpmINYeI-nhquqpk6OoqY80JBC3hSdSCOZxUv2yD-TAzxfugRaRv-0dl_ueiJ__8E669iu298Ziw23lBlCTpuZNpgeg7/s400/Screen+Shot+2015-09-30+at+3.07.07+PM.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF-fj3VRx1HbfQgB8E_E2XUOowWbaOJP04jy9zFbzx9ABzktnlvpmINYeI-nhquqpk6OoqY80JBC3hSdSCOZxUv2yD-TAzxfugRaRv-0dl_ueiJ__8E669iu298Ziw23lBlCTpuZNpgeg7/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B3.07.07%2BPM.png)

The final piece of the puzzle is an [Open Red](http://intothesymmetry.blogspot.it/2015/04/open-redirect-in-rfc6749-aka-oauth-20.html)[irect vulnerability that exists in rfc6749](http://intothesymmetry.blogspot.it/2015/04/open-redirect-in-rfc6749-aka-oauth-20.html) aka 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework' and some of its implementation . You can see an example of it clicking one of the links below:

* **Facebook**: <https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=1621835668046481&redirect_uri=http://www.attacker.com/&scope=WRONG_SCOPE>
* **Github:**<https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://attacker.com2&client_id=e2ddb90328315c367b11>
* **Microsoft:**<https://login.live.com/oauth20_authorize.srf?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://attacker.com&client_id=000000004C12822C>

The link will redirect to the registered\_uri (without any user interaction). Before Facebook fixed the data:text/html redirect\_uri clicking the following URL

[https://api.moves-app.com/oauth/v1/authorize?response\_type=code&client\_id=bc88FitX1298KPj2WS259BBMa9\_KCfL3&redirect\_uri=data%3Atext%2Fhtml%2Ca&state=<script>alert('hi')</script>](https://api.moves-app.com/oauth/v1/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=bc88FitX1298KPj2WS259BBMa9_KCfL3&redirect_uri=data%3Atext%2Fhtml%2Ca&state=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27hi%27)%3C/script%3E)

 would have redirected you to  data:text/html,a&state=<script>alert('hi')</script>
# The Attack

So far so good. Now let's try to sum up. Indeed we have all we need for a real attack. For an attacker would be enough to:

- find a website that offers OAuth support

- this website needs to allow registration of redirect\_uri also of the type data:text/html

- this website implements OAuth 2 verbatim hence has an open redirect

- craft a URI of the form [https://api.moves-app.com/oauth/v1/authorize?response\_type=code&client\_id=bc88FitX1298KPj2WS259BBMa9\_KCfL3&redirect\_uri=data%3Atext%2Fhtml%2Ca&state=<script>alert('hi')</script>](https://api.moves-app.com/oauth/v1/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=bc88FitX1298KPj2WS259BBMa9_KCfL3&redirect_uri=data%3Atext%2Fhtml%2Ca&state=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27hi%27%29%3C/script%3E)

And here we go, you would have a spoofed website (thanks to CVE-2015-5764)

# The Fix

Apple released two security updates this month that include a fix for this issue:

* the first one targeting iOS 9 was released [16 Sept 2015](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205212)
* the second one targeting Safari was released [30 Sept 2015](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222)

# Beyond URI spoofing

It looks like Apple Security team broke down the fix  for this issue in two tranches. Indeed if you careful read the description of CVE-2015-5764

**Description:** **Multiple user interface inconsistencies** may have allowed a
malicious website to display an arbitrary URL. These issues were
addressed through improved URL display logic.

This means that also other user interface were vulnerable and not only the address bar. One of the vulnerable component was the title of the alert box (that is commonly used for anti-phishing) .

But looks like Apple fixed this part of vulnerability in the [previous security update.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205033)

If you want to give a look to it  with Safari 8.0.7 :

[January 28, 2016](http://blog.intothesymmetry.com/2016/01/openssl-key-recovery-attack-on-dh-small.html "permanent link")

Usual Mandatory Disclaimer: IANAC (I am not a cryptographer) so I might likely end up writing a bunch of mistakes in this blog post... tl;dr The OpenSSL 1.0.2 releases suffer from a Key Recovery Attack on DH small subgroups . This issue got assigned CVE-2016-0701 with a severity of High and OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2f. If an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not "safe" or not Lim-Lee (as the one in RFC 5114 ) and either Static DH ciphersuites are used or DHE ciphersuites with the default OpenSSL configuration (in particular SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set) then is vulnerable to this attack.  It is believed that many popular applications (e.g. Apache mod\_ssl) do set the  SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option and would therefore not be at risk (for DHE ciphersuites), they still might be for Static DH ciphersuites. Introduction So if you are still here it means you wanna know more. And here is the thing. In my last bl...

### [Critical vulnerability in JSON Web Encryption (JWE) - RFC 7516](http://blog.intothesymmetry.com/2017/03/critical-vulnerability-in-json-web.html)

[March 13, 2017](http://blog.intothesymmetry.com/2017/03/critical-vulnerability-in-json-web.html "permanent link")

tl;dr if you are using go-jose , node-jose , jose2go , Nimbus JOSE+JWT or jose4j with ECDH-ES please update to the latest version. RFC 7516 aka JSON Web Encryption (JWE) hence many software libraries implementing this specification used to suffer from a classic Invalid Curve Attack . This would allow an attacker to completely recover the secret key of a party using JWE with Key Agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static (ECDH-ES) , where the sender could extract receiver’s private key. Premise In this blog post I assume you are already knowledgeable about elliptic curves and their use in cryptography. If not Nick Sullivan 's A (Relatively Easy To Understand) Primer on Elliptic Curve Cryptography or Andrea Corbellini's series Elliptic Curve Cryptography: finite fields and discrete logarithms are great starting points. Then if you further want to climb the elliptic learning curve including the related attacks you might also want to visit https://s...

tl;dr Mozilla Firefox prior to version 72 suffers from Small Subgroups Key Recovery Attack on DH in the WebCrypto 's API. The Firefox's team fixed the issue r emoving completely support for DH over finite fields (that is not in the WebCrypto standard). If you find this interesting read further below. Premise In this blog post I assume you are already knowledgeable about Diffie-Hellman over finite fields and related attacks. If not I recommend to read any cryptography book that covers public key cryptography.
