{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in OpenStack Neutron where an authenticated user can change the device owner of a port after it is created, but before firewall rules are applied.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Race condition",
    "Improper access control",
    "Firewall bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass firewall rules, including IP anti-spoofing controls, potentially allowing them to spoof IP addresses, perform DHCP spoofing, and intercept network traffic on shared networks.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user exploits the race condition by rapidly updating the 'device_owner' field of a port after it is created, but before firewall rules are applied.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment."
