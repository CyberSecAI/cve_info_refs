Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A programming error in the way the `MONITOR` command is handled in ircd-ratbox and its derivatives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A memory leak occurs when the `MONITOR` command is repeatedly used to add and remove offline nicknames.
- The memory leak is described as a "pointer-sized memory leak".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) event by repeatedly sending `MONITOR` commands to the server.
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting system memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the network by sending crafted `MONITOR` commands to the IRC server.
- A user does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker can be remote.
- An attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable IRC server and send commands.
- The attacker needs to send `MONITOR + offline_nick` and `MONITOR - offline_nick` repeatedly.

**Additional Details:**
- The memory leak is not drastic and requires aggressive spamming of the `MONITOR` command to become significant.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by unloading the `m_monitor.so` module if that's possible on the target system.
- The patch, if applied, will automatically garbage-collect memory leaked in the past but may not be completely effective because the allocator will remain fragmented.
- The issue is present in the following IRC daemons:
  - ircd-ratbox 3.0.8, SVN trunk and older
  - charybdis 3.5-dev and older
  - ircd-seven 1.1.3 and older
  - Elemental-IRCd 6.6.2 and older
- The fix is included in ircd-ratbox 3.0.9.
