| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271113#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 08:03:40 UTC  ``` A flaw was discovered in ircd-ratbox and its derivatives:  Elemental-IRCd is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC / RFC 1459) daemon intended for stable, secure deployments for both private and public-facing users. It provides quick messaging across servers, even when deployed on a global scale. One of the recent goals of the project has been to limit memory leaks and test functionality to ensure quality for all users.  While looking for resource leaks and other things to test inside Elemental-IRCd git master, we stumbled on an unfortunate programming error in how the MONITOR command was handled that can lead to a system out-of-memory event if an attacker hammers at the MONITOR command over and over.

Sorry to derail your ego-trip, but it's just a pointer-sized memory
leak.  You have to spam it very aggressively to make it leak in any
sort of drastic way.

Thank you for your lack of upstream bug report.  Thankfully, this
isn't really a critical security problem, as you describe below:

I'm totally quaking in my boots at this info-sec disaster, it must be
a security consultant's dream.

Again, people, it's just a relatively minor memory leak, in a codebase
with actual CVE-worthy bugs, mainly introduced by the developers who
"discovered" this one.

Except it doesn't really work, because the affected objects are placed
on a magazine allocator, so you are just left with a fragmented
allocator.  At best, it will just ensure there is no further memory
leak.  But of course you could just not care and wait patiently for
the next release, because there are far more effective ways to take
down the product in question.

I'll save you the time, it's basically:

while(1) {
   send MONITOR + offline_nick
   send MONITOR - offline_nick
}

Elemental-IRCd Security Release: 2015-10-07
===========================================

CVE-2015-5290

Elemental-IRCd reference code: e50b0d59-f3c5-4472-a3cd-e2e07731417c

Permanent link: <http://elemental-ircd.com/security/e50b0d59-f3c5-4472-a3cd-e2e07731417c>

Distribution of this document is unlimited and encouraged as long as it
remains unchanged.

## Summary

Elemental-IRCd is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC / RFC 1459) daemon intended
for stable, secure deployments for both private and public-facing users. It
provides quick messaging across servers, even when deployed on a global
scale. One of the recent goals of the project has been to limit memory
leaks and test functionality to ensure quality for all users.

While looking for resource leaks and other things to test inside
Elemental-IRCd git master, we stumbled on an unfortunate programming error
in how the MONITOR command was handled that can lead to a system
out-of-memory event if an attacker hammers at the MONITOR command over and
over.

## Affected Daemons

In our testing, the following IRC daemons were affected:

ircd-ratbox 3.0.8, SVN trunk and older
charybdis 3.5-dev and older
ircd-seven 1.1.3 and older
Elemental-IRCd 6.6.2 and older
Other derivatives of these daemons will be affected as well unless for some
reason they came across and fixed that issue before this release.

## Vulnerability Information

Public release date: 2015-10-07
CVE: CVE-2015-5290
CVSS v3:
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:W/RC:C/CR:H/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MC:L/MI:N/MA:H
CVSS score: 8.8 / 8.6 / 9.5
Attack complexity: Trivial (less than 30 lines of code)

## Notes

If applying these patches is somehow impossible, the attack can be
completely mitigated by unloading the m_monitor.so module using the
following command provided you have permission to load and unload modules:

    /MODUNLOAD m_monitor.so

The required privilege to do this is defined as the admin flag inside the
flags section of the relevant operator{} block in the configuration
(OLD:O:Line).

This patch can be applied at runtime and will automatically garbage-collect
any memory that has been leaked in the past.

A full set of technical details will be released as soon as it is confirmed
that major IRC networks affected by this have been patched.
