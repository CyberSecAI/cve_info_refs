Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A bug in the DNS packet parsing/generation code of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect processing of certain DNS packets.
- The vulnerability lies within the core parsing and generation logic of DNS packets

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Specially crafted packets can cause individual threads to crash, thus disabling service. In some configurations, it can cause the entire process to crash leading to a restart by a supervisor. This effectively disrupts the DNS service provided by the server.
- **Degraded Service:** The crash of individual threads leads to degraded service as some requests may be dropped

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted DNS query packets to a vulnerable PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- The attack is remote, exploiting the server over the network via DNS queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected PowerDNS server.
- No special privileges or access is required other than network connectivity to send crafted DNS packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- Only PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions 3.4.0 through 3.4.5 are affected.
- PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.6 and later are not vulnerable as they contain a fix for this issue.
- The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.
- A minimal patch was made available
- Running the Authoritative Server inside a supervisor with `distributor-threads` set to `1` can prevent complete denial of service, as the supervisor will restart the crashed process, although it does not fix the degraded service aspect of the vulnerability.
