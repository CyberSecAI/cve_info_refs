## Summary

Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Debug Mode and in exposed JSP files

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Affects of a cross-site scripting vulnerability when debug mode is switched on or JSPs are exposed in production environment. |
| Maximum security rating | Low |
| Recommendation | Turn off debug mode in production environment, apply tips from Security guideline to secure JSPs. An upgrade to [Struts 2.3.20](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2320) is recommended. |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts Struts 2.3.16.3 |
| Reporter | Takayoshi Isayama, Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. (vulnerability with JSPs)  anonymous (vulnerability with devMode) |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2015-5169 |

## Problem

When the Struts2 debug mode is turned on, under certain conditions an arbitrary script may be executed in the 'Problem Report' screen. Also if JSP files are exposed to be accessed directly it's possible to execute an arbitrary script.

## Solution

It is generally not advisable to have debug mode switched on outside of the development environment. Debug mode should always be turned off in production setup. Also never expose JSPs files directly and hide them inside `WEB-INF` folder or define dedicated security constraints to block access to raw JSP files. Please also read our [Security](/confluence/display/WW/Security) guide - it contains useful informations how to secure your application.

Struts >= 2.3.20 is not vulnerable to this attack. We recommend upgrading to Struts 2.3.20 or higher.

## Backward compatibility

No backward compatibility problems are expected.

## Workaround

Upgrade to Struts 2.3.20

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1260087#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-04 12:03:40 UTC  ``` When debug mode is switched on in Apache Struts, under certain conditions an arbitrary script may be executed in the 'Problem Report' screen. Affected versions are Struts 2.0.0 - 2.3.16.3.  External reference:  <https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-025.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1260087#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-04 12:07:53 UTC  ```  Created struts tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1260091](show_bug.cgi?id=1260091 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2015-5169 struts: XSS vulnerability when devMode is turned on [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1260092](show_bug.cgi?id=1260092 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2015-5169 struts: XSS vulnerability when devMode is turned on [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1260087#c2)  Chess Hazlett    2019-09-17 20:27:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  A previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.  The products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars: Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 Single Sign On 7.3.0+  If you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars: 1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location 2. Remove any files found This will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.   ``` |  |
