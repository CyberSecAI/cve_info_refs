| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1265607#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-23 10:57:45 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in WhiteHEAT USB Serial Driver in "whiteheat_attach" function in drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c was found. In the driver, the “COMMAND_PORT” variable is hard coded and is set to “4” (5th element). The driver assumes that the number of ports will always be 5 and takes the port number 5 as the command port. But using a specially made USB device in which the number of ports is set to a number less than 5 (e.g. 3), it triggers kernel NULL pointer dereference causing the system to freeze.  Disclosure post (including crash report logs):  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/629>  Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and MRG-2.  This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1265607#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-23 11:01:42 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1265612](show_bug.cgi?id=1265612 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5257 kernel: NULL pointer dereference in USB WhiteHEAT serial driver [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1265607#c4)  Fedora Update System    2015-10-03 17:32:47 UTC  ``` kernel-4.2.2-300.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

However, a typo was made when handling the id and the reporter's advisory incorrectly used [CVE-2015-5257](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5257) (the last two digits were swapped):  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/629>  The [CVE-2015-5257](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5257) was assigned to an issue in Apache Cordova Android:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/347>  However, because of wide use of [CVE-2015-5257](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5257) for the USB WhiteHEAT driver, MITRE CNA decided to keep [CVE-2015-5257](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5257) assigned to that issue, reject [CVE-2015-5275](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5275) as its duplicate, and assign a new CVE id [CVE-2015-8320](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-8320) for the Apache Cordova Android issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/356>   ``` |  |

## Description

drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.4 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. NOTE: this ID was incorrectly used for an Apache Cordova issue that has the correct ID of [CVE-2015-8320](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-87x6-r7ff-7gv7 "CVE-2015-8320").

# USN-2792-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

5 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize

IPC object state in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to

escalate their privileges, expose confidential information, or cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7613](/security/CVE-2015-7613))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set

by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a

route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like

NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of

service. ([CVE-2015-0272](/security/CVE-2015-0272))

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed

outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape

bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2015-2925](/security/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained

hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a

fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](/security/CVE-2015-5257))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2799-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

5 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed

outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape

bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2015-2925](/security/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained

hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a

fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](/security/CVE-2015-5257))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

Message-ID: <5601F731.3090409@istuary.com>

Subject: Vulnerability in WhiteHEAT Linux Driver-CVE-2015-5257

Hello,

We have discovered a vulnerability in a linux kernel module and would
like to inform you so that required actions could be taken.

Assigned CVE ID : CVE-2015-5257.

Below is the description of the vulnerability.

1. Software name and vendor name:
USB WhiteHEAT serial driver by ConnecTech in the Linux kernel
v3.19.0-28, but likely to exist in all kernel versions.

2. Type of vulnerability or attack outcome:

The vulnerability triggers a kernel NULL pointer dereference. It causes
the OS to freeze on many machines and requires a cold reboot, causing
denial of service.

3. A description of the affected code (e.g. the function name, the
vulnerable web page, link to the affected code, a bug entry, etc.):

The flaw exists in the "whiteheat_attach" function in
drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c in the Whiteheat USB Serial Driver in the
Linux kernel.
(<http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c?v=3.19>)

In the driver, the “COMMAND_PORT” variable is hard coded and is set to
“4” (5th element). So, the driver assumes that the number of ports
always will be 5 and takes the port number 5 as the command port. But,
using a specially made USB device in which the number of ports was set
to a number less than 5 (e.g. 3) we were able to perform Denial of
Service on the system due to a kernel NULL pointer dereference. The
system froze and requires a reboot.

You may find more information regarding the bug from the logs attached
to this email. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
--

# USN-2795-1: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

5 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed

outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape

bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2015-2925](/security/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained

hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a

fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](/security/CVE-2015-5257))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-67-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-67.110~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-67.110~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-67-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-67.110~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-67.110~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

USB: whiteheat: fix potential null-deref at probeFix potential null-pointer dereference at probe by making sure that the
required endpoints are present.
The whiteheat driver assumes there are at least five pairs of bulk
endpoints, of which the final pair is used for the "command port". An
attempt to bind to an interface with fewer bulk endpoints would
currently lead to an oops.
Fixes CVE-2015-5257.

# USN-2794-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

5 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed

outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape

bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2015-2925](/security/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained

hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a

fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](/security/CVE-2015-5257))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

  -
  [3.13.0-67.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-67.110)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

USB: whiteheat: fix potential null-deref at probe

```
Fix potential null-pointer dereference at probe by making sure that the
required endpoints are present.

The whiteheat driver assumes there are at least five pairs of bulk
endpoints, of which the final pair is used for the "command port". An
attempt to bind to an interface with fewer bulk endpoints would
currently lead to an oops.

Fixes [CVE-2015-5257](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v3mg-r9jg-vfg4 "CVE-2015-5257").

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# USN-2798-1: Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerabilities

5 November 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid

## Details

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed

outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape

bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2015-2925](/security/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained

hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a

fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](/security/CVE-2015-5257))

### Reduce your security exposure

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

sched/preempt, powerpc, kvm: Use need\_resched() instead of should\_resched()
commit c56dadf39761a6157239cac39e3988998c994f98 upstream.
Function should\_resched() is equal to (!preempt\_count() && need\_resched()).
In preemptive kernel preempt\_count here is non-zero because of vc->lock.

sched/preempt, xen: Use need\_resched() instead of should\_resched()
commit 0fa2f5cb2b0ecd8d56baa51f35f09aab234eb0bf upstream.
This code is used only when CONFIG\_PREEMPT=n and only in non-atomic context:
xen\_in\_preemptible\_hcall is set only in privcmd\_ioctl\_hypercall().
Thus preempt\_count is zero and should\_resched() is equal to need\_resched().

sched/preempt: Fix cond\_resched\_lock() and cond\_resched\_softirq()
commit fe32d3cd5e8eb0f82e459763374aa80797023403 upstream.
These functions check should\_resched() before unlocking spinlock/bh-enable:
preempt\_count always non-zero => should\_resched() always returns false.
cond\_resched\_lock() worked iff spin\_needbreak is set.
This patch adds argument "preempt\_offset" to should\_resched().
preempt\_count offset constants for that:
PREEMPT\_DISABLE\_OFFSET - offset after preempt\_disable()
PREEMPT\_LOCK\_OFFSET - offset after spin\_lock()
SOFTIRQ\_DISABLE\_OFFSET - offset after local\_bh\_distable()
SOFTIRQ\_LOCK\_OFFSET - offset after spin\_lock\_bh()

mm/slab: fix unexpected index mapping result of kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE+1)
commit 03a2d2a3eafe4015412cf4e9675ca0e2d9204074 upstream.
Commit description is copied from the original post of this bug:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/135349
Kernels after v3.9 use kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE + 1) to get the next
larger cache size than the size index INDEX\_NODE mapping. In kernels
3.9 and earlier we used malloc\_sizes[INDEX\_L3 + 1].cs\_size.
However, sometimes we can't get the right output we expected via
kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE + 1), causing a BUG().
The mapping table in the latest kernel is like:
index = {0, 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, n}
size = {0, 96, 192, 8, 16, 32, 64, 2^n}
The mapping table before 3.10 is like this:
index = {0 , 1 , 2, 3, 4 , 5 , 6, n}
size = {32, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 512, 2^(n+3)}
The problem on my mips64 machine is as follows:
(1) When configured DEBUG\_SLAB && DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC && DEBUG\_LOCK\_ALLOC
&& DEBUG\_SPINLOCK, the sizeof(struct kmem\_cache\_node) will be "150",
and the macro INDEX\_NODE turns out to be "2": #define INDEX\_NODE
kmalloc\_index(sizeof(struct kmem\_cache\_node))
(2) Then the result of kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE + 1) is 8.
(3) Then "if(size >= kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE + 1)" will lead to "size
= PAGE\_SIZE".
(4) Then "if ((size >= (PAGE\_SIZE >> 3))" test will be satisfied and
"flags |= CFLGS\_OFF\_SLAB" will be covered.
(5) if (flags & CFLGS\_OFF\_SLAB)" test will be satisfied and will go to
"cachep->slabp\_cache = kmalloc\_slab(slab\_size, 0u)", and the result
here may be NULL while kernel bootup.
(6) Finally,"BUG\_ON(ZERO\_OR\_NULL\_PTR(cachep->slabp\_cache));" causes the
BUG info as the following shows (may be only mips64 has this problem):
This patch fixes the problem of kmalloc\_size(INDEX\_NODE + 1) and removes
the BUG by adding 'size >= 256' check to guarantee that all necessary
small sized slabs are initialized regardless sequence of slab size in
mapping table.

tty: fix stall caused by missing memory barrier in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c
commit e81107d4c6bd098878af9796b24edc8d4a9524fd upstream.
My colleague ran into a program stall on a x86\_64 server, where
n\_tty\_read() was waiting for data even if there was data in the buffer
in the pty. kernel stack for the stuck process looks like below.
#0 [ffff88303d107b58] \_\_schedule at ffffffff815c4b20
#1 [ffff88303d107bd0] schedule at ffffffff815c513e
#2 [ffff88303d107bf0] schedule\_timeout at ffffffff815c7818
#3 [ffff88303d107ca0] wait\_woken at ffffffff81096bd2
#4 [ffff88303d107ce0] n\_tty\_read at ffffffff8136fa23
#5 [ffff88303d107dd0] tty\_read at ffffffff81368013
#6 [ffff88303d107e20] \_\_vfs\_read at ffffffff811a3704
#7 [ffff88303d107ec0] vfs\_read at ffffffff811a3a57
#8 [ffff88303d107f00] sys\_read at ffffffff811a4306
#9 [ffff88303d107f50] entry\_SYSCALL\_64\_fastpath at ffffffff815c86d7
There seems to be two problems causing this issue.
First, in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c, \_\_receive\_buf() stores the data and
updates ldata->commit\_head using smp\_store\_release() and then checks
the wait queue using waitqueue\_active(). However, since there is no
memory barrier, \_\_receive\_buf() could return without calling
wake\_up\_interactive\_poll(), and at the same time, n\_tty\_read() could
start to wait in wait\_woken() as in the following chart.
\_\_receive\_buf() n\_tty\_read()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
if (waitqueue\_active(&tty->read\_wait))
/\* Memory operations issued after the
RELEASE may be completed before the
RELEASE operation has completed \*/
add\_wait\_queue(&tty->read\_wait, &wait);
...
if (!input\_available\_p(tty, 0)) {
smp\_store\_release(&ldata->commit\_head,
ldata->read\_head);
...
timeout = wait\_woken(&wait,
TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE, timeout);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second problem is that n\_tty\_read() also lacks a memory barrier
call and could also cause \_\_receive\_buf() to return without calling
wake\_up\_interactive\_poll(), and n\_tty\_read() to wait in wait\_woken()
as in the chart below.
\_\_receive\_buf() n\_tty\_read()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
spin\_lock\_irqsave(&q->lock, flags);
/\* from add\_wait\_queue() \*/
...
if (!input\_available\_p(tty, 0)) {
/\* Memory operations issued after the
RELEASE may be completed before the
RELEASE operation has completed \*/
smp\_store\_release(&ldata->commit\_head,
ldata->read\_head);
if (waitqueue\_active(&tty->read\_wait))
\_\_add\_wait\_queue(q, wait);
spin\_unlock\_irqrestore(&q->lock,flags);
/\* from add\_wait\_queue() \*/
...
timeout = wait\_woken(&wait,
TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE, timeout);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are also other places in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c which have similar
calls to waitqueue\_active(), so instead of adding many memory barrier
calls, this patch simply removes the call to waitqueue\_active(),
leaving just wake\_up\*() behind.
This fixes both problems because, even though the memory access before
or after the spinlocks in both wake\_up\*() and add\_wait\_queue() can
sneak into the critical section, it cannot go past it and the critical
section assures that they will be serialized (please see "INTER-CPU
ACQUIRING BARRIER EFFECTS" in Documentation/memory-barriers.txt for a
better explanation). Moreover, the resulting code is much simpler.
Latency measurement using a ping-pong test over a pty doesn't show any
visible performance drop.

dm cache: fix NULL pointer when switching from cleaner policy
commit 2bffa1503c5c06192eb1459180fac4416575a966 upstream.
The cleaner policy doesn't make use of the per cache block hint space in
the metadata (unlike the other policies). When switching from the
cleaner policy to mq or smq a NULL pointer crash (in dm\_tm\_new\_block)
was observed. The crash was caused by bugs in dm-cache-metadata.c
when trying to skip creation of the hint btree.
The minimal fix is to change hint size for the cleaner policy to 4 bytes
(only hint size supported).

namei: results of d\_is\_negative() should be checked after dentry revalidation
commit daf3761c9fcde0f4ca64321cbed6c1c86d304193 upstream.
Leandro Awa writes:
"After switching to version 4.1.6, our parallelized and distributed
workflows now fail consistently with errors of the form:
T34: ./regex.c:39:22: error: config.h: No such file or directory
From our 'git bisect' testing, the following commit appears to be the
possible cause of the behavior we've been seeing: commit 766c4cbfacd8"
Al Viro says:
"What happens is that 766c4cbfacd8 got the things subtly wrong.
We used to treat d\_is\_negative() after lookup\_fast() as "fall with
ENOENT". That was wrong - checking ->d\_flags outside of ->d\_seq
protection is unreliable and failing with hard error on what should've
fallen back to non-RCU pathname resolution is a bug.
Unfortunately, we'd pulled the test too far up and ran afoul of
another kind of staleness. The dentry might have been absolutely
stable from the RCU point of view (and we might be on UP, etc), but
stale from the remote fs point of view. If ->d\_revalidate() returns
"it's actually stale", dentry gets thrown away and the original code
wouldn't even have looked at its ->d\_flags.
What we need is to check ->d\_flags where 766c4cbfacd8 does (prior to
->d\_seq validation) but only use the result in cases where we do not
discard this dentry outright"

clocksource: Fix abs() usage w/ 64bit values
commit 67dfae0cd72fec5cd158b6e5fb1647b7dbe0834c upstream.
This patch fixes one cases where abs() was being used with 64-bit
nanosecond values, where the result may be capped at 32-bits.
This potentially could cause watchdog false negatives on 32-bit
systems, so this patch addresses the issue by using abs64().

genirq: Fix race in register\_irq\_proc()
commit 95c2b17534654829db428f11bcf4297c059a2a7e upstream.
Per-IRQ directories in procfs are created only when a handler is first
added to the irqdesc, not when the irqdesc is created. In the case of
a shared IRQ, multiple tasks can race to create a directory. This
race condition seems to have been present forever, but is easier to
hit with async probing.

igb: do not re-init SR-IOV during probe
commit 6423fc34160939142d72ffeaa2db6408317f54df upstream.
During driver probing the following code path is triggered.
igb\_probe
->igb\_sw\_init
->igb\_probe\_vfs
->igb\_pci\_enable\_sriov
->igb\_sriov\_reinit
Doing the SR-IOV re-init is not necessary during probing since we're
starting from scratch. Here we can call igb\_enable\_sriov() right away.
Running igb\_sriov\_reinit() during igb\_probe() also seems to cause
occasional packet loss on some onboard 82576 NICs. Reproduced on
Dell and HP servers with onboard 82576 NICs.

Request allocation has been moved to connect\_ring, which is called every
time blkback connects to the frontend (this can happen multiple times during
a blkback instance life cycle). On the other hand, request freeing has not
been moved, so it's only called when destroying the backend instance. Due to
this mismatch, blkback can allocate the request pool multiple times, without
freeing it.
In order to fix it, move the freeing of requests to xen\_blkif\_disconnect to
restore the symmetry between request allocation and freeing.

m68k: Define asmlinkage\_protect
commit 8474ba74193d302e8340dddd1e16c85cc4b98caf upstream.
Make sure the compiler does not modify arguments of syscall functions.
This can happen if the compiler generates a tailcall to another
function. For example, without asmlinkage\_protect sys\_openat is compiled
into this function:
sys\_openat:
clr.l %d0
move.w 18(%sp),%d0
move.l %d0,16(%sp)
jbra do\_sys\_open
Note how the fourth argument is modified in place, modifying the register
%d4 that gets restored from this stack slot when the function returns to
user-space. The caller may expect the register to be unmodified across
system calls.

arm64: readahead: fault retry breaks mmap file read random detection
commit 569ba74a7ba69f46ce2950bf085b37fea2408385 upstream.
This is the arm64 portion of commit 45cac65b0fcd ("readahead: fault
retry breaks mmap file read random detection"), which was absent from
the initial port and has since gone unnoticed. The original commit says:
> .fault now can retry. The retry can break state machine of .fault. In
> filemap\_fault, if page is miss, ra->mmap\_miss is increased. In the second
> try, since the page is in page cache now, ra->mmap\_miss is decreased. And
> these are done in one fault, so we can't detect random mmap file access.
>
> Add a new flag to indicate .fault is tried once. In the second try, skip
> ra->mmap\_miss decreasing. The filemap\_fault state machine is ok with it.
With this change, Mark reports that:
> Random read improves by 250%, sequential read improves by 40%, and
> random write by 400% to an eMMC device with dm crypto wrapped around it.

arm64/efi: Fix boot crash by not padding between EFI\_MEMORY\_RUNTIME regions
commit 0ce3cc008ec04258b6a6314b09f1a6012810881a upstream.
The new Properties Table feature introduced in UEFIv2.5 may
split memory regions that cover PE/COFF memory images into
separate code and data regions. Since these regions only differ
in the type (runtime code vs runtime data) and the permission
bits, but not in the memory type attributes (UC/WC/WT/WB), the
spec does not require them to be aligned to 64 KB.
Since the relative offset of PE/COFF .text and .data segments
cannot be changed on the fly, this means that we can no longer
pad out those regions to be mappable using 64 KB pages.
Unfortunately, there is no annotation in the UEFI memory map
that identifies data regions that were split off from a code
region, so we must apply this logic to all adjacent runtime
regions whose attributes only differ in the permission bits.
So instead of rounding each memory region to 64 KB alignment at
both ends, only round down regions that are not directly
preceded by another runtime region with the same type
attributes. Since the UEFI spec does not mandate that the memory
map be sorted, this means we also need to sort it first.
Note that this change will result in all EFI\_MEMORY\_RUNTIME
regions whose start addresses are not aligned to the OS page
size to be mapped with executable permissions (i.e., on kernels
compiled with 64 KB pages). However, since these mappings are
only active during the time that UEFI Runtime Services are being
invoked, the window for abuse is rather small.

vfs: Test for and handle paths that are unreachable from their mnt\_root
commit 397d425dc26da728396e66d392d5dcb8dac30c37 upstream.
In rare cases a directory can be renamed out from under a bind mount.
In those cases without special handling it becomes possible to walk up
the directory tree to the root dentry of the filesystem and down
from the root dentry to every other file or directory on the filesystem.
Like division by zero .. from an unconnected path can not be given
a useful semantic as there is no predicting at which path component
the code will realize it is unconnected. We certainly can not match
the current behavior as the current behavior is a security hole.
Therefore when encounting .. when following an unconnected path
return -ENOENT.
- Add a function path\_connected to verify path->dentry is reachable
from path->mnt.mnt\_root. AKA to validate that rename did not do
something nasty to the bind mount.
To avoid races path\_connected must be called after following a path
component to it's next path component.

dcache: Handle escaped paths in prepend\_path
commit cde93be45a8a90d8c264c776fab63487b5038a65 upstream.
A rename can result in a dentry that by walking up d\_parent
will never reach it's mnt\_root. For lack of a better term
I call this an escaped path.
prepend\_path is called by four different functions \_\_d\_path,
d\_absolute\_path, d\_path, and getcwd.
\_\_d\_path only wants to see paths are connected to the root it passes
in. So \_\_d\_path needs prepend\_path to return an error.
d\_absolute\_path similarly wants to see paths that are connected to
some root. Escaped paths are not connected to any mnt\_root so
d\_absolute\_path needs prepend\_path to return an error greater
than 1. So escaped paths will be treated like paths on lazily
unmounted mounts.
getcwd needs to prepend "(unreachable)" so getcwd also needs
prepend\_path to return an error.
d\_path is the interesting hold out. d\_path just wants to print
something, and does not care about the weird cases. Which raises
the question what should be printed?
Given that / should result in -ENOENT I
believe it is desirable for escaped paths to be printed as empty
paths. As there are not really any meaninful path components when
considered from the perspective of a mount tree.
So tweak prepend\_path to return an empty path with an new error
code of 3 when it encounters an escaped path.

mmc: core: Don't return an error for CD/WP GPIOs when GPIOLIB is unset
commit 43934ece2ea72c1dd279c0b0478c1a036d5d77ee upstream.
When CONFIG\_GPIOLIB is unset, its stubs will return -ENOSYS. That means
when the mmc core parses DT for CD/WP GPIOs via mmc\_of\_parse(), -ENOSYS
becomes propagated to the caller. Typically this means that the mmc host
driver fails to probe.
As the CD/WP GPIOs are already treated as optional, let's extend that to
cover the case when CONFIG\_GPIOLIB is unset.

iscsi-target: Avoid OFMarker + IFMarker negotiation
commit 673681cafa99776e334c3e61cafa2cf115950c32 upstream.
This patch fixes a v4.2+ regression introduced by commit c04a6091
that removed support for obsolete sync-and-steering markers usage
as originally defined in RFC-3720.
The regression would involve attempting to send OFMarker=No +
IFMarker=No keys during opertional negotiation login phase,
including when initiators did not actually propose these keys.
The result for MSFT iSCSI initiators would be random junk in
TCP stream after the last successful login request was been sent
signaling the move to full feature phase (FFP) operation.
To address this bug, go ahead and avoid negotiating these keys
by default unless the initiator explicitly proposes them, but
still respond to them with 'No' if they are proposed.

of the parent directory and ubifs\_init\_security() tries to acquire i\_mutex
of a new inode, it reveals that taking i\_mutex in ubifs\_init\_security() is
in vain because it is only being called in the inode allocation path
and therefore nobody else can see the inode yet.

powerpc/MSI: Fix race condition in tearing down MSI interrupts
commit e297c939b745e420ef0b9dc989cb87bda617b399 upstream.
This fixes a race which can result in the same virtual IRQ number
being assigned to two different MSI interrupts. The most visible
consequence of that is usually a warning and stack trace from the
sysfs code about an attempt to create a duplicate entry in sysfs.
The race happens when one CPU (say CPU 0) is disposing of an MSI
while another CPU (say CPU 1) is setting up an MSI. CPU 0 calls
(for example) pnv\_teardown\_msi\_irqs(), which calls
msi\_bitmap\_free\_hwirqs() to indicate that the MSI (i.e. its
hardware IRQ number) is no longer in use. Then, before CPU 0 gets
to calling irq\_dispose\_mapping() to free up the virtal IRQ number,
CPU 1 comes in and calls msi\_bitmap\_alloc\_hwirqs() to allocate an
MSI, and gets the same hardware IRQ number that CPU 0 just freed.
CPU 1 then calls irq\_create\_mapping() to get a virtual IRQ number,
which sees that there is currently a mapping for that hardware IRQ
number and returns the corresponding virtual IRQ number (which is
the same virtual IRQ number that CPU 0 was using). CPU 0 then
calls irq\_dispose\_mapping() and frees that virtual IRQ number.
Now, if another CPU comes along and calls irq\_create\_mapping(), it
is likely to get the virtual IRQ number that was just freed,
resulting in the same virtual IRQ number apparently being used for
two different hardware interrupts.
To fix this race, we just move the call to msi\_bitmap\_free\_hwirqs()
to after the call to irq\_dispose\_mapping(). Since virq\_to\_hw()
doesn't work for the virtual IRQ number after irq\_dispose\_mapping()
has been called, we need to call it before irq\_dispose\_mapping() and
remember the result for the msi\_bitmap\_free\_hwirqs() call.
The pattern of calling msi\_bitmap\_free\_hwirqs() before
irq\_dispose\_mapping() appears in 5 places under arch/powerpc, and
appears to have originated in commit 05af7bd2d75e ("[POWERPC] MPIC
U3/U4 MSI backend") from 2007.

tools lib traceevent: Fix string handling in heterogeneous arch environments
commit c2e4b24ff848bb180f9b9cd873a38327cd219ad2 upstream.
When a trace recorded on a 32-bit device is processed with a 64-bit
binary, the higher 32-bits of the address need to ignored.
The lack of this results in the output of the 64-bit pointer
value to the trace as the 32-bit address lookup fails in find\_printk().
Before:
burn-1778 [003] 548.600305: bputs: 0xc0046db2s: 2cec5c058d98c
After:
burn-1778 [003] 548.600305: bputs: 0xc0046db2s: RT throttling activated
The problem occurs in PRINT\_FIELD when the field is recognized as a
pointer to a string (of the type const char \*)
Heterogeneous architectures cases below can arise and should be handled:
\* Traces recorded using 32-bit addresses processed on a 64-bit machine
\* Traces recorded using 64-bit addresses processed on a 32-bit machine

batman-adv: Fix potential synchronization issues in mcast tvlv handler
commit 8a4023c5b5e30b11f1f383186f4a7222b3b823cf upstream.
So far the mcast tvlv handler did not anticipate the processing of
multiple incoming OGMs from the same originator at the same time. This
can lead to various issues:
\* Broken refcounting: For instance two mcast handlers might both assume
that an originator just got multicast capabilities and will together
wrongly decrease mcast.num\_disabled by two, potentially leading to
an integer underflow.
\* Potential kernel panic on hlist\_del\_rcu(): Two mcast handlers might
one after another try to do an
hlist\_del\_rcu(&orig->mcast\_want\_all\_\*\_node). The second one will
cause memory corruption / crashes.
(Reported by: Sven Eckelmann )
Right in the beginning the code path makes assumptions about the current
multicast related state of an originator and bases all updates on that. The
easiest and least error prune way to fix the issues in this case is to
serialize multiple mcast handler invocations with a spinlock.

commit 53960059d56ecef67d4ddd546731623641a3d2d1 upstream.
If there is a DMA zone (usually 24bit = 16MB I believe), but no DMA32
zone, as is the case for some 32-bit kernels, then massage\_gfp\_flags()
will cause DMA memory allocated for devices with a 32..63-bit
coherent\_dma\_mask to fall back to using \_\_GFP\_DMA, even though there may
only be 32-bits of physical address available anyway.
Correct that case to compare against a mask the size of phys\_addr\_t
instead of always using a 64-bit mask.

crypto: marvell - properly handle CRYPTO\_TFM\_REQ\_MAY\_BACKLOG-flagged requests
commit cfcd2271a9076a9891014bc8e18d4fd48acccffe upstream.
The mv\_cesa\_queue\_req() function calls crypto\_enqueue\_request() to
enqueue a request. In the normal case (i.e the queue isn't full), this
function returns -EINPROGRESS. The current Marvell CESA crypto driver
takes this into account and cleans up the request only if an error
occured, i.e if the return value is not -EINPROGRESS.
Unfortunately this causes problems with
CRYPTO\_TFM\_REQ\_MAY\_BACKLOG-flagged requests. When such a request is
passed to crypto\_enqueue\_request() and the queue is full,
crypto\_enqueue\_request() will return -EBUSY, but will keep the request
enqueued nonetheless. This situation was not properly handled by the
Marvell CESA driver, which was anyway cleaning up the request in such
a situation. When later on the request was taken out of the backlog
and actually processed, a kernel crash occured due to the internal
driver data structures for this structure having been cleaned up.
To avoid this situation, this commit adds a
mv\_cesa\_req\_needs\_cleanup() helper function which indicates if the
request needs to be cleaned up or not after a call to
crypto\_enqueue\_request(). This helper allows to do the cleanup only in
the appropriate cases, and all call sites of mv\_cesa\_queue\_req() are
fixed to use this new helper function.

usb: Add device quirk for Logitech PTZ cameras
commit 72194739f54607bbf8cfded159627a2015381557 upstream.
Add a device quirk for the Logitech PTZ Pro Camera and its sibling the
ConferenceCam CC3000e Camera.
This fixes the failed camera enumeration on some boot, particularly on
machines with fast CPU.
Tested by connecting a Logitech PTZ Pro Camera to a machine with a
Haswell Core i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz, and doing thousands of reboot cycles
while recording the kernel logs and taking camera picture after each boot.
Before the patch, more than 7% of the boots show some enumeration transfer
failures and in a few of them, the kernel is giving up before actually
enumerating the webcam. After the patch, the enumeration has been correct
on every reboot.

usb: Use the USB\_SS\_MULT() macro to get the burst multiplier.
commit ff30cbc8da425754e8ab96904db1d295bd034f27 upstream.
Bits 1:0 of the bmAttributes are used for the burst multiplier.
The rest of the bits used to be reserved (zero), but USB3.1 takes bit 7
into use.
Use the existing USB\_SS\_MULT() macro instead to make sure the mult value
and hence max packet calculations are correct for USB3.1 devices.
Note that burst multiplier in bmAttributes is zero based and that
the USB\_SS\_MULT() macro adds one.

usb: chipidea: udc: using the correct stall implementation
commit 56ffa1d154c7e12af16273f0cdc42690dd05caf5 upstream.
According to spec, there are functional and protocol stalls.
For functional stall, it is for bulk and interrupt endpoints,
below are cases for it:
- Host sends SET\_FEATURE request for Set-Halt, the udc driver
needs to set stall, and return true unconditionally.
- The gadget driver may call usb\_ep\_set\_halt to stall certain
endpoints, if there is a transfer in pending, the udc driver
should not set stall, and return -EAGAIN accordingly.
These two kinds of stall need to be cleared by host using CLEAR\_FEATURE
request (Clear-Halt).
For protocol stall, it is for control endpoint, this stall will
be set if the control request has failed. This stall will be
cleared by next setup request (hardware will do it).
It fixed usbtest (drivers/usb/misc/usbtest.c) Test 13 "set/clear halt"
test failure, meanwhile, this change has been verified by
USB2 CV Compliance Test and MSC Tests.

ath10k: wake up queue upon vif creation
commit 6d2d51ecfff13f5f6ffc476dccf4d5b2668072eb upstream.
Vif's vdev\_id is used as queue number. However due
to the tx pausing design in ath10k it was possible
for a new interface to be created with its tx
queue stopped (via ieee80211\_stop\_queues). This
could in turn leave the interface inoperable until
ath10k\_mac\_tx\_unlock() was called.
This problem only affected multi-vif scenarios when
new interfaces were created some time later after
other interfaces have been running for some time
and had Tx queue full at some point prior.
Possible manifestation of the bug was
authentication timeout for a client vif.

ath10k: reject 11b tx fragmentation configuration
commit 92092fe528e79c9bd25784ca0ef341d5a1d1b642 upstream.
Even though there's a WMI enum for fragmentation
threshold no known firmware actually implements
it. Moreover it is not possible to rely frame
fragmentation to mac80211 because firmware clears
the "more fragments" bit in frame control making
it impossible for remote devices to reassemble
frames.
Hence implement a dummy callback just to say
fragmentation isn't supported. This effectively
prevents mac80211 from doing frame fragmentation
in software.
This fixes Tx becoming broken after setting
fragmentation threshold.

cifs: use server timestamp for ntlmv2 authentication
commit 98ce94c8df762d413b3ecb849e2b966b21606d04 upstream.
Linux cifs mount with ntlmssp against an Mac OS X (Yosemite
10.10.5) share fails in case the clocks differ more than +/-2h:
digest-service: digest-request: od failed with 2 proto=ntlmv2
digest-service: digest-request: kdc failed with -1561745592 proto=ntlmv2
Fix this by (re-)using the given server timestamp for the
ntlmv2 authentication (as Windows 7 does).
A related problem was also reported earlier by Namjae Jaen (see below):
Windows machine has extended security feature which refuse to allow
authentication when there is time difference between server time and
client time when ntlmv2 negotiation is used. This problem is prevalent
in embedded enviornment where system time is set to default 1970.
Modern servers send the server timestamp in the TargetInfo Av\_Pair
structure in the challenge message [see MS-NLMP 2.2.2.1]
In [MS-NLMP 3.1.5.1.2] it is explicitly mentioned that the client must
use the server provided timestamp if present OR current time if it is
not

mmc: dw\_mmc: handle data blocks > than 4kB if IDMAC is used
commit 5959b32e3636f9bfe3f869d1e440bc4a4d660965 upstream.
As per DW MobileStorage databook "each descriptor can transfer up to 4kB
of data in chained mode", moreover buffer size that is put in "des1" is
limited to 13 bits, i.e. for example on attempt to
IDMAC\_SET\_BUFFER1\_SIZE(desc, 8192) size value that's effectively written
will be 0.
On the platform with 8kB PAGE\_SIZE I see dw\_mmc gets data blocks in
SG-list of 8kB size and that leads to unpredictable behavior of the
SD/MMC controller.
In particular on write to FAT partition of SD-card the controller will
stuck in the middle of DMA transaction.
Solution to the problem is simple - we need to pass large (> 4kB) data
buffers to the controller via multiple descriptors. And that's what
that change does.
What's interesting I did try original driver on same platform but
configured with 4kB PAGE\_SIZE and may confirm that data blocks passed
in SG-list to dw\_mmc never exeed 4kB limit - that explains why nobody
ever faced a problem I did.

thermal: cpu\_cooling: don't call kcalloc() under rcu\_read\_lock
commit 459ac37506d195713b5e82271a2ac44a777e47df upstream.
build\_dyn\_power\_table() allocates the power table while holding
rcu\_read\_lock. kcalloc using GFP\_KERNEL may sleep, so it can't be
called in an RCU read-side path.
Move the rcu protection to the part of the function that really needs
it: the part that handles the dev\_pm\_opp pointer received from
dev\_pm\_opp\_find\_freq\_ceil(). In the unlikely case that there is an OPP
added to the cpu while this function is running, return -EAGAIN.

batman-adv: Make DAT capability changes atomic
commit 65d7d46050704bcdb8121ddbf4110bfbf2b38baa upstream.
Bitwise OR/AND assignments in C aren't guaranteed to be atomic. One
OGM handler might undo the set/clear of a specific bit from another
handler run in between.
Fix this by using the atomic set\_bit()/clear\_bit()/test\_bit() functions.

Initialize msg/shm IPC objects before doing ipc\_addid()
commit b9a532277938798b53178d5a66af6e2915cb27cf upstream.
As reported by Dmitry Vyukov, we really shouldn't do ipc\_addid() before
having initialized the IPC object state. Yes, we initialize the IPC
object in a locked state, but with all the lockless RCU lookup work,
that IPC object lock no longer means that the state cannot be seen.
We already did this for the IPC semaphore code (see commit e8577d1f0329:
"ipc/sem.c: fully initialize sem\_array before making it visible") but we
clearly forgot about msg and shm.

xhci: init command timeout timer earlier to avoid deleting it uninitialized
commit cc8e4fc0c3b5e8340bc8358990515d116a3c274c upstream.
Don't check if timer is running with a timer\_pending() before
deleting it with del\_timer\_sync(), this defies the whole point of
the sync part and can cause a possible race.
Instead we just want to make sure the timer is initialized early enough
before we have a chance to delete it.

xhci: change xhci 1.0 only restrictions to support xhci 1.1
commit dca7794539eff04b786fb6907186989e5eaaa9c2 upstream.
Some changes between xhci 0.96 and xhci 1.0 specifications forced us to
check the hci version in code, some of these checks were implemented as
hci\_version == 1.0, which will not work with new xhci 1.1 controllers.
xhci 1.1 behaves similar to xhci 1.0 in these cases, so change these
checks to hci\_version >= 1.0

usb: xhci: exit early in xhci\_setup\_device() if we're halted or dying
commit 448116bfa856d3c076fa7178ed96661a008a5d45 upstream.
During quick plug/removal of OTG adapter during dual-role testing
it can happen that xhci\_alloc\_device() is called for the newly
detected device after the DRD library has called xhci\_stop to
remove the HCD.
If that is the case, just fail early to prevent the following warning.

Fix potential null-pointer dereference at probe by making sure that the
required endpoints are present.
The whiteheat driver assumes there are at least five pairs of bulk
endpoints, of which the final pair is used for the "command port". An
attempt to bind to an interface with fewer bulk endpoints would
currently lead to an oops.

So we don't need to sync the work here, this was causing

drm/dp/mst: fixup handling hotplug on port removal.
commit df4839fdc9b3c922586b945f062f38cbbda022bb upstream.
output ports should always have a connector, unless
in the rare case connector allocation fails in the
driver.
In this case we only need to teardown the pdt,
and free the struct, and there is no need to
send a hotplug msg.
In the case were we add the port to the destroy
list we need to send a hotplug if we destroy
any connectors, so userspace knows to reprobe
stuff.
this patch also handles port->connector allocation
failing which should be a rare event, but makes
the code consistent.

drm: Reject DRI1 hw lock ioctl functions for kms drivers
commit da168d81b44898404d281d5dbe70154ab5f117c1 upstream.
I've done some extensive history digging across libdrm, mesa and
xf86-video-{intel,nouveau,ati}. The only potential user of this with
kms drivers I could find was ttmtest, which once used drmGetLock
still. But that mistake was quickly fixed up. Even the intel xvmc
library (which otherwise was really good with using dri1 stuff in kms
mode) managed to never take the hw lock for dri2 (and hence kms).
Hence it should be save to unconditionally disallow this.

drm/i915/bios: handle MIPI Sequence Block v3+ gracefully
commit cd67d226ebd909d239d2c6e5a6abd6e2a338d1cd upstream.
The VBT MIPI Sequence Block version 3 has forward incompatible changes:
First, the block size in the header has been specified reserved, and the
actual size is a separate 32-bit value within the block. The current
find\_section() function to will only look at the size in the block
header, and, depending on what's in that now reserved size field,
continue looking for other sections in the wrong place.
Fix this by taking the new block size field into account. This will
ensure that the lookups for other sections will work properly, as long
as the new 32-bit size does not go beyond the opregion VBT mailbox size.
Second, the contents of the block have been completely
changed. Gracefully refuse parsing the yet unknown data version.

Do not fall back to SMBWriteX in set\_file\_size error cases
commit 646200a041203f440fb6fcf9cacd9efeda9de74c upstream.
The error paths in set\_file\_size for cifs and smb3 are incorrect.
In the unlikely event that a server did not support set file info
of the file size, the code incorrectly falls back to trying SMBWriteX
(note that only the original core SMB Write, used for example by DOS,
can set the file size this way - this actually does not work for the more
recent SMBWriteX). The idea was since the old DOS SMB Write could set
the file size if you write zero bytes at that offset then use that if
server rejects the normal set file info call.
Fortunately the SMBWriteX will never be sent on the wire (except when
file size is zero) since the length and offset fields were reversed
in the two places in this function that call SMBWriteX causing
the fall back path to return an error. It is also important to never call
an SMB request from an SMB2/sMB3 session (which theoretically would
be possible, and can cause a brief session drop, although the client
recovers) so this should be fixed. In practice this path does not happen
with modern servers but the error fall back to SMBWriteX is clearly wrong.
Removing the calls to SMBWriteX in the error paths in cifs\_set\_file\_size

NFSv4: Recovery of recalled read delegations is broken
commit 24311f884189d42d40354a6f38ca218eb9aeb811 upstream.
When a read delegation is being recalled, and we're reclaiming the
cached opens, we need to make sure that we only reclaim read-only
modes.
A previous attempt to do this, relied on retrieving the delegation
type from the nfs4\_opendata structure. Unfortunately, as Kinglong
pointed out, this field can only be set when performing reboot recovery.
Furthermore, if we call nfs4\_open\_recover(), then we end up clobbering
the state->flags for all modes that we're not recovering...
The fix is to have the delegation recall code pass this information
to the recovery call, and then refactor the recovery code so that
nfs4\_open\_delegation\_recall() does not need to call nfs4\_open\_recover().

regulator: core: Handle probe deferral from DT when resolving supplies
commit 06423121d9eba0a56b9341cf82b88479017bce14 upstream.
When resolving regulator-regulator supplies we ignore probe deferral
returns from regulator\_dev\_lookup() (such as are generated for DT when
we can see a supply is registered) and just fall back to the dummy
regulator if there are full constraints (as is the case for DT). This
means that probe deferral is broken for DT systems, fix that by paying
attention to -EPROBE\_DEFER return codes like we do -ENODEV.
A further patch will simplify this further, this is a minimal fix for
the specific issue.

netfilter: conntrack: use nf\_ct\_tmpl\_free in CT/synproxy error paths
commit 9cf94eab8b309e8bcc78b41dd1561c75b537dd0b upstream.
Commit 0838aa7fcfcd ("netfilter: fix netns dependencies with conntrack
templates") migrated templates to the new allocator api, but forgot to
update error paths for them in CT and synproxy to use nf\_ct\_tmpl\_free()
instead of nf\_conntrack\_free().
Due to that, memory is being freed into the wrong kmemcache, but also
we drop the per net reference count of ct objects causing an imbalance.
In Brad's case, this leads to a wrap-around of net->ct.count and thus
lets \_\_nf\_conntrack\_alloc() refuse to create a new ct object:
[ 10.340913] xt\_addrtype: ipv6 does not support BROADCAST matching

[...]
With slab debugging, it also reports the wrong kmemcache (kmalloc-512 vs.
nf\_conntrack\_ffffffff81ce75c0) and reports poison overwrites, etc. Thus,
to fix the problem, export and use nf\_ct\_tmpl\_free() instead.

netfilter: nfnetlink: work around wrong endianess in res\_id field
commit a9de9777d613500b089a7416f936bf3ae5f070d2 upstream.
The convention in nfnetlink is to use network byte order in every header field
as well as in the attribute payload. The initial version of the batching
infrastructure assumes that res\_id comes in host byte order though.
The only client of the batching infrastructure is nf\_tables, so let's add a
workaround to address this inconsistency. We currently have 11 nfnetlink
subsystems according to NFNL\_SUBSYS\_COUNT, so we can assume that the subsystem
2560, ie. htons(10), will not be allocated anytime soon, so it can be an alias
of nf\_tables from the nfnetlink batching path when interpreting the res\_id
field.
Based on original patch from Florian Westphal.

netfilter: bridge: fix IPv6 packets not being bridged with CONFIG\_IPV6=n
commit 18e1db67e93ed75d9dc0d34c8d783ccf10547c2b upstream.
230ac490f7fba introduced a dependency to CONFIG\_IPV6 which breaks bridging
of IPv6 packets on a bridge with CONFIG\_IPV6=n.
Sysctl entry /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables defaults to 1,
for this reason packets are handled by br\_nf\_pre\_routing\_ipv6(). When compiled
with CONFIG\_IPV6=n this function returns NF\_DROP but should return NF\_ACCEPT
to let packets through.
Change CONFIG\_IPV6=n br\_nf\_pre\_routing\_ipv6() return value to NF\_ACCEPT.
Tested with a simple bridge with two interfaces and IPv6 packets trying
to pass from host on left side to host on right side of the bridge.

dm raid: fix round up of default region size
commit 042745ee53a0a7c1f5aff191a4a24213c6dcfb52 upstream.
Commit 3a0f9aaee028 ("dm raid: round region\_size to power of two")
intended to make sure that the default region size is a power of two.
However, the logic in that commit is incorrect and sets the variable
region\_size to 0 or 1, depending on whether min\_region\_size is a power
of two.
Fix this logic, using roundup\_pow\_of\_two(), so that region\_size is
properly rounded up to the next power of two.

md/raid0: update queue parameter in a safer location.
commit 199dc6ed5179251fa6158a461499c24bdd99c836 upstream.
When a (e.g.) RAID5 array is reshaped to RAID0, the updating
of queue parameters (e.g. max number of sectors per bio) is
done in the wrong place.
It should be part of ->run, but it is actually part of ->takeover.
This means it happens before level\_store() calls:
blk\_set\_stacking\_limits(&mddev->queue->limits);
and so it ineffective. This can lead to errors from underlying
devices.
So move all the relevant settings out of create\_stripe\_zones()
and into raid0\_run().
As this can lead to a bug-on it is suitable for any -stable
kernel which supports reshape to RAID0. So 2.6.35 or later.
As the bug has been present for five years there is no urgency,
so no need to rush into -stable.

svcrdma: Fix send\_reply() scatter/gather set-up
commit 9d11b51ce7c150a69e761e30518f294fc73d55ff upstream.
The Linux NFS server returns garbage in the data payload of inline
NFS/RDMA READ replies. These are READs of under 1000 bytes or so
where the client has not provided either a reply chunk or a write
list.
The NFS server delivers the data payload for an NFS READ reply to
the transport in an xdr\_buf page list. If the NFS client did not
provide a reply chunk or a write list, send\_reply() is supposed to
set up a separate sge for the page containing the READ data, and
another sge for XDR padding if needed, then post all of the sges via
a single SEND Work Request.
The problem is send\_reply() does not advance through the xdr\_buf
when setting up scatter/gather entries for SEND WR. It always calls
dma\_map\_xdr with xdr\_off set to zero. When there's more than one
sge, dma\_map\_xdr() sets up the SEND sge's so they all point to the
xdr\_buf's head.
The current Linux NFS/RDMA client always provides a reply chunk or
a write list when performing an NFS READ over RDMA. Therefore, it
does not exercise this particular case. The Linux server has never
had to use more than one extra sge for building RPC/RDMA replies
with a Linux client.
However, an NFS/RDMA client \_is\_ allowed to send small NFS READs
without setting up a write list or reply chunk. The NFS READ reply
fits entirely within the inline reply buffer in this case. This is
perhaps a more efficient way of performing NFS READs that the Linux
NFS/RDMA client may some day adopt.

dm crypt: constrain crypt device's max\_segment\_size to PAGE\_SIZE
commit 586b286b110e94eb31840ac5afc0c24e0881fe34 upstream.
Setting the dm-crypt device's max\_segment\_size to PAGE\_SIZE is an
unfortunate constraint that is required to avoid the potential for
exceeding dm-crypt's underlying device's max\_segments limits -- due to
crypt\_alloc\_buffer() possibly allocating pages for the encryption bio
that are not as physically contiguous as the original bio.
It is interesting to note that this problem was already fixed back in
2007 via commit 91e106259 ("dm crypt: use bio\_add\_page"). But Linux 4.0
commit cf2f1abfb ("dm crypt: don't allocate pages for a partial
request") regressed dm-crypt back to \_not\_ using bio\_add\_page(). But
given dm-crypt's cpu parallelization changes all depend on commit
cf2f1abfb's abandoning of the more complex io fragments processing that
dm-crypt previously had we cannot easily go back to using
bio\_add\_page().
So all said the cleanest way to resolve this issue is to fix dm-crypt to
properly constrain the original bios entering dm-crypt so the encryption
bios that dm-crypt generates from the original bios are always
compatible with the underlying device's max\_segments queue limits.
It should be noted that technically Linux 4.3 does \_not\_ need this fix
because of the block core's new late bio-splitting capability. But, it
is reasoned, there is little to be gained by having the block core split
the encrypted bio that is composed of PAGE\_SIZE segments. That said, in
the future we may revert this change.

PCI: Clear IORESOURCE\_UNSET when clipping a bridge window
commit b838b39e930aa1cfd099ea82ac40ed6d6413af26 upstream.
c770cb4cb505 ("PCI: Mark invalid BARs as unassigned") sets IORESOURCE\_UNSET
if we fail to claim a resource. If we tried to claim a bridge window,
failed, clipped the window, and tried to claim the clipped window, we
failed again because of IORESOURCE\_UNSET:
pci\_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xc0000000-0xffffffff window]
pci 0000:00:01.0: can't claim BAR 15 [mem 0xbdf00000-0xddefffff 64bit pref]: no compatible bridge window
pci 0000:00:01.0: [mem size 0x20000000 64bit pref] clipped to [mem size 0x1df00000 64bit pref]
pci 0000:00:01.0: bridge window [mem size 0x1df00000 64bit pref]
pci 0000:00:01.0: can't claim BAR 15 [mem size 0x1df00000 64bit pref]: no address assigned
The 00:01.0 window started as [mem 0xbdf00000-0xddefffff 64bit pref]. That
starts before the host bridge window [mem 0xc0000000-0xffffffff window], so
we clipped the 00:01.0 window to [mem 0xc0000000-0xddefffff 64bit pref].
But we left it marked IORESOURCE\_UNSET, so the second claim failed when it
should have succeeded.
This means downstream devices will also fail for lack of resources, e.g.,
in the bugzilla below,
radeon 0000:01:00.0: Fatal error during GPU init
Clear IORESOURCE\_UNSET when we clip a bridge window. Also clear
IORESOURCE\_UNSET in our copy of the unclipped window so we can see exactly
what the original window was and how it now fits inside the upstream
window.

Flip this around so we only set PCI\_DEV\_FLAGS\_VPD\_REF\_F0 for functions that
are identical to function 0, and allow regular VPD access for any other

Btrfs: update fix for read corruption of compressed and shared extents
commit 808f80b46790f27e145c72112189d6a3be2bc884 upstream.
My previous fix in commit 005efedf2c7d ("Btrfs: fix read corruption of
compressed and shared extents") was effective only if the compressed
extents cover a file range with a length that is not a multiple of 16
pages. That's because the detection of when we reached a different range
of the file that shares the same compressed extent as the previously
processed range was done at extent\_io.c:\_\_do\_contiguous\_readpages(),
which covers subranges with a length up to 16 pages, because
extent\_readpages() groups the pages in clusters no larger than 16 pages.
So fix this by tracking the start of the previously processed file
range's extent map at extent\_readpages().
The following test case for fstests reproduces the issue:
seq=`basename $0`
seqres=$RESULT\_DIR/$seq
echo "QA output created by $seq"

Btrfs: fix read corruption of compressed and shared extents
commit 005efedf2c7d0a270ffbe28d8997b03844f3e3e7 upstream.
If a file has a range pointing to a compressed extent, followed by
another range that points to the same compressed extent and a read
operation attempts to read both ranges (either completely or part of
them), the pages that correspond to the second range are incorrectly
filled with zeroes.
Consider the following example:
File layout
[0 - 8K] [8K - 24K]
| |
| |
points to extent X, points to extent X,
offset 4K, length of 8K offset 0, length 16K
[extent X, compressed length = 4K uncompressed length = 16K]
If a readpages() call spans the 2 ranges, a single bio to read the extent
is submitted - extent\_io.c:submit\_extent\_page() would only create a new
bio to cover the second range pointing to the extent if the extent it
points to had a different logical address than the extent associated with
the first range. This has a consequence of the compressed read end io
handler (compression.c:end\_compressed\_bio\_read()) finish once the extent
is decompressed into the pages covering the first range, leaving the
remaining pages (belonging to the second range) filled with zeroes (done
by compression.c:btrfs\_clear\_biovec\_end()).
So fix this by submitting the current bio whenever we find a range
pointing to a compressed extent that was preceded by a range with a
different extent map. This is the simplest solution for this corner
case. Making the end io callback populate both ranges (or more, if we
have multiple pointing to the same extent) is a much more complex
solution since each bio is tightly coupled with a single extent map and
the extent maps associated to the ranges pointing to the shared extent
can have different offsets and lengths.

btrfs: skip waiting on ordered range for special files
commit a30e577c96f59b1e1678ea5462432b09bf7d5cbc upstream.
In btrfs\_evict\_inode, we properly truncate the page cache for evicted
inodes but then we call btrfs\_wait\_ordered\_range for every inode as well.
It's the right thing to do for regular files but results in incorrect
behavior for device inodes for block devices.
filemap\_fdatawrite\_range gets called with inode->i\_mapping which gets
resolved to the block device inode before getting passed to
wbc\_attach\_fdatawrite\_inode and ultimately to inode\_to\_bdi. What happens
next depends on whether there's an open file handle associated with the
inode. If there is, we write to the block device, which is unexpected
behavior. If there isn't, we through normally and inode->i\_data is used.
We can also end up racing against open/close which can result in crashes
when i\_mapping points to a block device inode that has been closed.
Since there can't be any page cache associated with special file inodes,
it's safe to skip the btrfs\_wait\_ordered\_range call entirely and avoid
the problem.

ASoC: fix broken pxa SoC support
commit 3c8f7710c1c44fb650bc29b6ef78ed8b60cfaa28 upstream.
The previous fix of pxa library support, which was introduced to fix the

code binding pxa2xx-ac97 with a coded relied on :
- sound/soc/pxa/pxa2xx-ac97.c
- sound/soc/codecs/XXX.c
For example, the mioa701\_wm9713.c machine code is currently broken. The
"select ARM" statement wrongly selects the soc/arm/pxa2xx-ac97 for
compilation, as per an unfortunate fate SND\_PXA2XX\_AC97 is both declared

Fix this by ensuring that SND\_PXA2XX\_SOC correctly triggers the correct

ALSA: synth: Fix conflicting OSS device registration on AWE32
commit 225db5762dc1a35b26850477ffa06e5cd0097243 upstream.
When OSS emulation is loaded on ISA SB AWE32 chip, we get now kernel
warnings like:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2791 at fs/sysfs/dir.c:31 sysfs\_warn\_dup+0x51/0x80()
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/isa/sbawe.0/sound/card0/seq-oss-0-0'
It's because both emux synth and opl3 drivers try to register their
OSS device object with the same static index number 0. This hasn't
been a big problem until the recent rewrite of device management code
(that exposes sysfs at the same time), but it's been an obvious bug.
This patch works around it just by using a different index number of
emux synth object. There can be a more elegant way to fix, but it's
enough for now, as this code won't be touched so often, in anyway.

Lenovo Thinkpads with recent Realtek codecs seem suffering from click
noises at power transition since the introduction of widget power
saving in 4.1 kernel. Although this might be solved by some delays in
appropriate points, as a quick workaround, just disable the

small, and this makes the situation back to pre 4.1 time.
This patch ended up with a bit more code changes than usual because
the existing fixup for Thinkpads is highly chained. Instead of adding
yet another chain, combine a few of them into a single fixup entry, as
a gratis cleanup.

The Tegra HD-audio controller driver causes deadlocks when loaded as a
module since the driver invokes request\_module() at binding with the
codec driver. This patch works around it by deferring the probe in a
work like Intel HD-audio controller driver does. Although hovering
the codec probe stuff into udev would be a better solution, it may
cause other regressions, so let's try this band-aid fix until the more
proper solution gets landed.

memcg: fix dirty page migration
commit 0610c25daa3e76e38ad5a8fae683a89ff9f71798 upstream.
The problem starts with a file backed dirty page which is charged to a
memcg. Then page migration is used to move oldpage to newpage.
Migration:
- copies the oldpage's data to newpage
- clears oldpage.PG\_dirty
- sets newpage.PG\_dirty
- uncharges oldpage from memcg
- charges newpage to memcg
Clearing oldpage.PG\_dirty decrements the charged memcg's dirty page
count.
However, because newpage is not yet charged, setting newpage.PG\_dirty
does not increment the memcg's dirty page count. After migration
completes newpage.PG\_dirty is eventually cleared, often in
account\_page\_cleaned(). At this time newpage is charged to a memcg so
the memcg's dirty page count is decremented which causes underflow
because the count was not previously incremented by migration. This
underflow causes balance\_dirty\_pages() to see a very large unsigned
number of dirty memcg pages which leads to aggressive throttling of
buffered writes by processes in non root memcg.
This issue:
- can harm performance of non root memcg buffered writes.
- can report too small (even negative) values in
memory.stat[(total\_)dirty] counters of all memcg, including the root.
To avoid polluting migrate.c with #ifdef CONFIG\_MEMCG checks, introduce
page\_memcg() and set\_page\_memcg() helpers.
Test:
0) setup and enter limited memcg
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
echo 1G > /sys/fs/cgroup/test/memory.limit\_in\_bytes
echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/test/cgroup.procs

mm: hugetlbfs: skip shared VMAs when unmapping private pages to satisfy a fault
commit 2f84a8990ebbe235c59716896e017c6b2ca1200f upstream.
SunDong reported the following on
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=103841
I think I find a linux bug, I have the test cases is constructed. I
can stable recurring problems in fedora22(4.0.4) kernel version,
arch for x86\_64. I construct transparent huge page, when the parent
and child process with MAP\_SHARE, MAP\_PRIVATE way to access the same
huge page area, it has the opportunity to lead to huge page copy on
write failure, and then it will munmap the child corresponding mmap
area, but then the child mmap area with VM\_MAYSHARE attributes, child
process munmap this area can trigger VM\_BUG\_ON in set\_vma\_resv\_flags
functions (vma - > vm\_flags & VM\_MAYSHARE).
There were a number of problems with the report (e.g. it's hugetlbfs that
triggers this, not transparent huge pages) but it was fundamentally
correct in that a VM\_BUG\_ON in set\_vma\_resv\_flags() can be triggered that
looks like this
vma ffff8804651fd0d0 start 00007fc474e00000 end 00007fc475e00000
next ffff8804651fd018 prev ffff8804651fd188 mm ffff88046b1b1800

kernel BUG at mm/hugetlb.c:462!
SMP
Modules linked in: xt\_pkttype xt\_LOG xt\_limit [..]
CPU: 38 PID: 26839 Comm: map Not tainted 4.0.4-default #1
Hardware name: Dell Inc. PowerEdge R810/0TT6JF, BIOS 2.7.4 04/26/2012
set\_vma\_resv\_flags+0x2d/0x30
The VM\_BUG\_ON is correct because private and shared mappings have
different reservation accounting but the warning clearly shows that the
VMA is shared.
When a private COW fails to allocate a new page then only the process
that created the VMA gets the page -- all the children unmap the page.
If the children access that data in the future then they get killed.
The problem is that the same file is mapped shared and private. During
the COW, the allocation fails, the VMAs are traversed to unmap the other
private pages but a shared VMA is found and the bug is triggered. This
patch identifies such VMAs and skips them.

dlm\_grab() which will take dlm\_domain\_lock.

spi: spidev: fix possible NULL dereference
commit dd85ebf681ef0ee1fc985c353dd45e8b53b5dc1e upstream.
During the last close we are freeing spidev if spidev->spi is NULL, but
just before checking if spidev->spi is NULL we are dereferencing it.
Lets add a check there to avoid the NULL dereference.

spi: spi-pxa2xx: Check status register to determine if SSSR\_TINT is disabled
commit 02bc933ebb59208f42c2e6305b2c17fd306f695d upstream.
On Intel Baytrail, there is case when interrupt handler get called, no SPI
message is captured. The RX FIFO is indeed empty when RX timeout pending
interrupt (SSSR\_TINT) happens.
Use the BIOS version where both HSUART and SPI are on the same IRQ. Both
drivers are using IRQF\_SHARED when calling the request\_irq function. When
running two separate and independent SPI and HSUART application that
generate data traffic on both components, user will see messages like
below on the console:
pxa2xx-spi pxa2xx-spi.0: bad message state in interrupt handler
This commit will fix this by first checking Receiver Time-out Interrupt,
if it is disabled, ignore the request and return without servicing.

spi: bcm2835: BUG: fix wrong use of PAGE\_MASK
commit 2a3fffd45822070309bcf0b1e1dae624d633824a upstream.
There is a bug in the alignment checking of transfers,
that results in DMA not being used for un-aligned
transfers that do not cross page-boundries, which is valid.
This is due to a missconception of the meaning PAGE\_MASK
when implementing that check originally - (PAGE\_SIZE - 1)
should have been used instead.
Also fixes a copy/paste error.

spi: Fix documentation of spi\_alloc\_master()
commit a394d635193b641f2c86ead5ada5b115d57c51f8 upstream.
Actually, spi\_master\_put() after spi\_alloc\_master() must \_not\_ be followed
by kfree(). The memory is already freed with the call to spi\_master\_put()
through spi\_master\_class, which registers a release function. Calling both
spi\_master\_put() and kfree() results in often nasty (and delayed) crashes
elsewhere in the kernel, often in the networking stack.
This reverts commit eb4af0f5349235df2e4a5057a72fc8962d00308a.

memcg: make mem\_cgroup\_read\_stat() unsigned
commit 484ebb3b8c8b27dd2171696462a3116edb9ff801 upstream.
mem\_cgroup\_read\_stat() returns a page count by summing per cpu page
counters. The summing is racy wrt. updates, so a transient negative
sum is possible. Callers don't want negative values:
- mem\_cgroup\_wb\_stats() doesn't want negative nr\_dirty or nr\_writeback.
This could confuse dirty throttling.
- oom reports and memory.stat shouldn't show confusing negative usage.
- tree\_usage() already avoids negatives.
Avoid returning negative page counts from mem\_cgroup\_read\_stat() and
convert it to unsigned.

commit 0c986253b939cc14c69d4adbe2b4121bdf4aa220 upstream.
This reverts commit d59cfc09c32a2ae31f1c3bc2983a0cd79afb3f14.
d59cfc09c32a ("sched, cgroup: replace signal\_struct->group\_rwsem with

fork and exits so that it uses global percpu\_rwsem instead of
per-process rwsem; unfortunately, the write [un]lock paths of
percpu\_rwsem always involve synchronize\_rcu\_expedited() which turned
out to be too expensive.

s390/boot/decompression: disable floating point in decompressor
commit adc0b7fbf6fe9967505c0254d9535ec7288186ae upstream.
my gcc 5.1 used an ldgr instruction with a register != 0,2,4,6 for
spilling/filling into a floating point register in our decompressor.
This will cause an AFP-register data exception as the decompressor
did not setup the additional floating point registers via cr0.
That causes a program check loop that looked like a hang with
one "Uncompressing Linux... " message (directly booted via kvm)
or a loop of "Uncompressing Linux... " messages (when booted via
zipl boot loader).
The offending code in my build was
48e400: e3 c0 af ff ff 71 lay %r12,-1(%r10)
-->48e406: b3 c1 00 1c ldgr %f1,%r12
48e40a: ec 6c 01 22 02 7f clij %r6,2,12,0x48e64e
but gcc could do spilling into an fpr at any function. We can
simply disable floating point support at that early stage.

s390/compat: correct uc\_sigmask of the compat signal frame
commit 8d4bd0ed0439dfc780aab801a085961925ed6838 upstream.
The uc\_sigmask in the ucontext structure is an array of words to keep
the 64 signal bits (or 1024 if you ask glibc but the kernel sigset\_t
only has 64 bits).
For 64 bit the sigset\_t contains a single 8 byte word, but for 31 bit
there are two 4 byte words. The compat signal handler code uses a
simple copy of the 64 bit sigset\_t to the 31 bit compat\_sigset\_t.
As s390 is a big-endian architecture this is incorrect, the two words
in the 31 bit sigset\_t array need to be swapped.

sched/core: Fix TASK\_DEAD race in finish\_task\_switch()
commit 95913d97914f44db2b81271c2e2ebd4d2ac2df83 upstream.
So the problem this patch is trying to address is as follows:
CPU0 CPU1
context\_switch(A, B)
ttwu(A)
LOCK A->pi\_lock
A->on\_cpu == 0
finish\_task\_switch(A)
prev\_state = A->state <-.
WMB |
A->on\_cpu = 0; |
UNLOCK rq0->lock |
| context\_switch(C, A)
`-- A->state = TASK\_DEAD
prev\_state == TASK\_DEAD
put\_task\_struct(A)
context\_switch(A, C)
finish\_task\_switch(A)
A->state == TASK\_DEAD
put\_task\_struct(A)
The argument being that the WMB will allow the load of A->state on CPU0
to cross over and observe CPU1's store of A->state, which will then
result in a double-drop and use-after-free.
Now the comment states (and this was true once upon a long time ago)
that we need to observe A->state while holding rq->lock because that
will order us against the wakeup; however the wakeup will not in fact
acquire (that) rq->lock; it takes A->pi\_lock these days.
We can obviously fix this by upgrading the WMB to an MB, but that is
expensive, so we'd rather avoid that.
The alternative this patch takes is: smp\_store\_release(&A->on\_cpu, 0),
which avoids the MB on some archs, but not important ones like ARM.

leds:lp55xx: Correct Kconfig dependency for f/w user helper

The commit [b67893206fc0: leds:lp55xx: fix firmware loading error]
tries to address the firmware file handling with user helper, but it
sets a wrong Kconfig CONFIG\_FW\_LOADER\_USER\_HELPER\_FALLBACK. Since the
wrong option was enabled, the system got a regression -- it suffers
from the unexpected long delays for non-present firmware files.
This patch corrects the Kconfig dependency to the right one,
CONFIG\_FW\_LOADER\_USER\_HELPER. This doesn't change the fallback
behavior but only enables UMH when needed.

x86/xen: Support kexec/kdump in HVM guests by doing a soft reset
commit 0b34a166f291d255755be46e43ed5497cdd194f2 upstream.
Currently there is a number of issues preventing PVHVM Xen guests from
doing successful kexec/kdump:
- Bound event channels.
- Registered vcpu\_info.
- PIRQ/emuirq mappings.
- shared\_info frame after XENMAPSPACE\_shared\_info operation.
- Active grant mappings.
Basically, newly booted kernel stumbles upon already set up Xen
interfaces and there is no way to reestablish them. In Xen-4.7 a new
feature called 'soft reset' is coming. A guest performing kexec/kdump
operation is supposed to call SCHEDOP\_shutdown hypercall with
SHUTDOWN\_soft\_reset reason before jumping to new kernel. Hypervisor
(with some help from toolstack) will do full domain cleanup (but
keeping its memory and vCPU contexts intact) returning the guest to
the state it had when it was first booted and thus allowing it to
start over.
Doing SHUTDOWN\_soft\_reset on Xen hypervisors which don't support it is
probably OK as by default all unknown shutdown reasons cause domain
destroy with a message in toolstack log: 'Unknown shutdown reason code
5. Destroying domain.' which gives a clue to what the problem is and
eliminates false expectations.

x86/process: Add proper bound checks in 64bit get\_wchan()
commit eddd3826a1a0190e5235703d1e666affa4d13b96 upstream.
Dmitry Vyukov reported the following using trinity and the memory

./arch/x86/kernel/process\_64.c:444
The address checks in the 64bit implementation of get\_wchan() are
wrong in several ways:
- The lower bound of the stack is not the start of the stack
page. It's the start of the stack page plus sizeof (struct
thread\_info)
- The upper bound must be:
top\_of\_stack - TOP\_OF\_KERNEL\_STACK\_PADDING - 2 \* sizeof(unsigned long).
The 2 \* sizeof(unsigned long) is required because the stack pointer
points at the frame pointer. The layout on the stack is: ... IP FP
... IP FP. So we need to make sure that both IP and FP are in the
bounds.
Fix the bound checks and get rid of the mix of numeric constants, u64
and unsigned long. Making all unsigned long allows us to use the same
function for 32bit as well.
Use READ\_ONCE() when accessing the stack. This does not prevent a
concurrent wakeup of the task and the stack changing, but at least it
avoids TOCTOU.
Also check task state at the end of the loop. Again that does not
prevent concurrent changes, but it avoids walking for nothing.
Add proper comments while at it.

x86/kexec: Fix kexec crash in syscall kexec\_file\_load()
commit e3c41e37b0f4b18cbd4dac76cbeece5a7558b909 upstream.
The original bug is a page fault crash that sometimes happens
on big machines when preparing ELF headers:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffc90613fc9000
IP: [] prepare\_elf64\_ram\_headers\_callback+0x165/0x260
The bug is caused by us under-counting the number of memory ranges
and subsequently not allocating enough ELF header space for them.
The bug is typically masked on smaller systems, because the ELF header
allocation is rounded up to the next page.
This patch modifies the code in fill\_up\_crash\_elf\_data() by using
walk\_system\_ram\_res() instead of walk\_system\_ram\_range() to correctly
count the max number of crash memory ranges. That's because the
walk\_system\_ram\_range() filters out small memory regions that
reside in the same page, but walk\_system\_ram\_res() does not.
Here's how I found the bug:
After tracing prepare\_elf64\_headers() and prepare\_elf64\_ram\_headers\_callback(),
the code uses walk\_system\_ram\_res() to fill-in crash memory regions information
to the program header, so it counts those small memory regions that
reside in a page area.
But, when the kernel was using walk\_system\_ram\_range() in
fill\_up\_crash\_elf\_data() to count the number of crash memory regions,
it filters out small regions.
I printed those small memory regions, for example:
kexec: Get nr\_ram ranges. vaddr=0xffff880077592258 paddr=0x77592258, sz=0xdc0
Based on the code in walk\_system\_ram\_range(), this memory region
will be filtered out:

So, the max\_nr\_ranges that's counted by the kernel doesn't include
small memory regions - causing us to under-allocate the required space.
That causes the page fault crash that happens in a later code path
when preparing ELF headers.
This bug is not easy to reproduce on small machines that have few
CPUs, because the allocated page aligned ELF buffer has more free
space to cover those small memory regions' PT\_LOAD headers.

x86/efi: Fix boot crash by mapping EFI memmap entries bottom-up at runtime, instead of top-down
commit a5caa209ba9c29c6421292e7879d2387a2ef39c9 upstream.
Beginning with UEFI v2.5 EFI\_PROPERTIES\_TABLE was introduced
that signals that the firmware PE/COFF loader supports splitting
code and data sections of PE/COFF images into separate EFI
memory map entries. This allows the kernel to map those regions
with strict memory protections, e.g. EFI\_MEMORY\_RO for code,
EFI\_MEMORY\_XP for data, etc.
Unfortunately, an unwritten requirement of this new feature is
that the regions need to be mapped with the same offsets
relative to each other as observed in the EFI memory map. If
this is not done crashes like this may occur,
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at fffffffefe6086dd
IP: [] 0xfffffffefe6086dd
Call Trace:

[] start\_kernel+0x38a/0x417
[] x86\_64\_start\_reservations+0x2a/0x2c
[] x86\_64\_start\_kernel+0xeb/0xef
Here 0xfffffffefe6086dd refers to an address the firmware
expects to be mapped but which the OS never claimed was mapped.
The issue is that included in these regions are relative
addresses to other regions which were emitted by the firmware
toolchain before the "splitting" of sections occurred at
runtime.
Needless to say, we don't satisfy this unwritten requirement on
x86\_64 and instead map the EFI memory map entries in reverse
order. The above crash is almost certainly triggerable with any
kernel newer than v3.13 because that's when we rewrote the EFI
runtime region mapping code, in commit d2f7cbe7b26a ("x86/efi:
Runtime services virtual mapping"). For kernel versions before
v3.13 things may work by pure luck depending on the
fragmentation of the kernel virtual address space at the time we
map the EFI regions.
Instead of mapping the EFI memory map entries in reverse order,
where entry N has a higher virtual address than entry N+1, map
them in the same order as they appear in the EFI memory map to
preserve this relative offset between regions.
This patch has been kept as small as possible with the intention
that it should be applied aggressively to stable and
distribution kernels. It is very much a bugfix rather than
support for a new feature, since when EFI\_PROPERTIES\_TABLE is
enabled we must map things as outlined above to even boot - we
have no way of asking the firmware not to split the code/data
regions.
In fact, this patch doesn't even make use of the more strict
memory protections available in UEFI v2.5. That will come later.

The cpu feature flags are not ever going to change, so warning

The warning seems to only occur when nested virtualization is

commit 83c133cf11fb0e68a51681447e372489f052d40e upstream.
The NMI entry code that switches to the normal kernel stack needs to
be very careful not to clobber any extra stack slots on the NMI
stack. The code is fine under the assumption that SWAPGS is just a
normal instruction, but that assumption isn't really true. Use
SWAPGS\_UNSAFE\_STACK instead.
This is part of a fix for some random crashes that Sasha saw.

x86/paravirt: Replace the paravirt nop with a bona fide empty function
commit fc57a7c68020dcf954428869eafd934c0ab1536f upstream.
PARAVIRT\_ADJUST\_EXCEPTION\_FRAME generates this code (using nmi as an
example, trimmed for readability):
ff 15 00 00 00 00 callq \*0x0(%rip) # 2796
2792: R\_X86\_64\_PC32 pv\_irq\_ops+0x2c
That's a call through a function pointer to regular C function that
does nothing on native boots, but that function isn't protected
against kprobes, isn't marked notrace, and is certainly not
guaranteed to preserve any registers if the compiler is feeling
perverse. This is bad news for a CLBR\_NONE operation.
Of course, if everything works correctly, once paravirt ops are
patched, it gets nopped out, but what if we hit this code before
paravirt ops are patched in? This can potentially cause breakage
that is very difficult to debug.
A more subtle failure is possible here, too: if \_paravirt\_nop uses
the stack at all (even just to push RBP), it will overwrite the "NMI
executing" variable if it's called in the NMI prologue.
The Xen case, perhaps surprisingly, is fine, because it's already
written in asm.
Fix all of the cases that default to paravirt\_nop (including
adjust\_exception\_frame) with a big hammer: replace paravirt\_nop with
an asm function that is just a ret instruction.
The Xen case may have other problems, so document them.
This is part of a fix for some random crashes that Sasha saw.

commit 39d9b77b8debb4746e189aa5b61ae6e81ec5eab8 upstream.
On Intel Tangier the MMC host controller is wired up to irq 0. But
several other devices have irq 0 associated as well due to a bogus PCI
configuration.
The first initialized driver will acquire irq 0 and make it
unavailable for other devices. If the sdhci driver is not the first
one it will fail to acquire the interrupt and therefor be non
functional.
Add a quirk to the pci irq enable function which denies irq 0 to
anything else than the MMC host controller driver on Tangier
platforms.

x86/ioapic: Force affinity setting in setup\_ioapic\_dest()
commit 4857c91f0d195f05908fff296ba1ec5fca87066c upstream.
The recent ioapic cleanups changed the affinity setting in
setup\_ioapic\_dest() from a direct write to the hardware to the delayed
affinity setup via irq\_set\_affinity().
That results in a warning from chained\_irq\_exit():
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5 at kernel/irq/migration.c:32 irq\_move\_masked\_irq
[] irq\_move\_masked\_irq+0xb8/0xc0
[] ioapic\_ack\_level+0x111/0x130
[] intel\_gpio\_irq\_handler+0x148/0x1c0
The reason is that irq\_set\_affinity() does not write directly to the
hardware. It marks the affinity setting as pending and executes it
from the next interrupt. The chained handler infrastructure does not
take the irq descriptor lock for performance reasons because such a
chained interrupt is not visible to any interfaces. So the delayed
affinity setting triggers the warning in irq\_move\_masked\_irq().
Restore the old behaviour by calling the set\_affinity function of the
ioapic chip in setup\_ioapic\_dest(). This is safe as none of the
interrupts can be on the fly at this point.

x86/platform: Fix Geode LX timekeeping in the generic x86 build
commit 03da3ff1cfcd7774c8780d2547ba0d995f7dc03d upstream.
In 2007, commit 07190a08eef36 ("Mark TSC on GeodeLX reliable")
bypassed verification of the TSC on Geode LX. However, this code
(now in the check\_system\_tsc\_reliable() function in
arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c) was only present if CONFIG\_MGEODE\_LX was
set.
OpenWRT has recently started building its generic Geode target
for Geode GX, not LX, to include support for additional
platforms. This broke the timekeeping on LX-based devices,
because the TSC wasn't marked as reliable:
https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20531
By adding a runtime check on is\_geode\_lx(), we can also include
the fix if CONFIG\_MGEODEGX1 or CONFIG\_X86\_GENERIC are set, thus
fixing the problem.

x86/apic: Serialize LVTT and TSC\_DEADLINE writes
commit 5d7c631d926b59aa16f3c56eaeb83f1036c81dc7 upstream.
The APIC LVTT register is MMIO mapped but the TSC\_DEADLINE register is an
MSR. The write to the TSC\_DEADLINE MSR is not serializing, so it's not
guaranteed that the write to LVTT has reached the APIC before the
TSC\_DEADLINE MSR is written. In such a case the write to the MSR is
ignored and as a consequence the local timer interrupt never fires.
The SDM decribes this issue for xAPIC and x2APIC modes. The
serialization methods recommended by the SDM differ.
xAPIC:
"1. Memory-mapped write to LVT Timer Register, setting bits 18:17 to 10b.
2. WRMSR to the IA32\_TSC\_DEADLINE MSR a value much larger than current time-stamp counter.
3. If RDMSR of the IA32\_TSC\_DEADLINE MSR returns zero, go to step 2.
4. WRMSR to the IA32\_TSC\_DEADLINE MSR the desired deadline."
x2APIC:
"To allow for efficient access to the APIC registers in x2APIC mode,
the serializing semantics of WRMSR are relaxed when writing to the
APIC registers. Thus, system software should not use 'WRMSR to APIC
registers in x2APIC mode' as a serializing instruction. Read and write
accesses to the APIC registers will occur in program order. A WRMSR to
an APIC register may complete before all preceding stores are globally
visible; software can prevent this by inserting a serializing
instruction, an SFENCE, or an MFENCE before the WRMSR."
The xAPIC method is to just wait for the memory mapped write to hit
the LVTT by checking whether the MSR write has reached the hardware.
There is no reason why a proper MFENCE after the memory mapped write would
not do the same. Andi Kleen confirmed that MFENCE is sufficient for the
xAPIC case as well.
Issue MFENCE before writing to the TSC\_DEADLINE MSR. This can be done
unconditionally as all CPUs which have TSC\_DEADLINE also have MFENCE
support.

dax: fix O\_DIRECT I/O to the last block of a blockdev
commit e94f5a2285fc94202a9efb2c687481f29b64132c upstream.
commit bbab37ddc20b (block: Add support for DAX reads/writes to
block devices) caused a regression in mkfs.xfs. That utility
sets the block size of the device to the logical block size
using the BLKBSZSET ioctl, and then issues a single sector read
from the last sector of the device. This results in the dax\_io
code trying to do a page-sized read from 512 bytes from the end
of the device. The result is -ERANGE being returned to userspace.
The fix is to align the block to the page size before calling
get\_block.
Thanks to willy for simplifying my original patch.

ARM: EXYNOS: reset Little cores when cpu is up
commit 833b5794e3303cc97a0d2d4ba97f26cc9d9b4b79 upstream.
The cpu booting of exynos5422 has been still broken since we discussed
it in last year[1]. This patch is inspired from Odroid XU3
code (Actually, it was from samsung exynos vendor kernel)[2]. This weird
reset code was founded exynos5420 octa cores series SoCs and only
required for the first boot core is the Little core (Cortex A7).
Some of the exynos5420 boards and all of the exynos5422 boards will require
this code.
There is two ways to check the little core is the first cpu. One is
checking GPG2CON[1] GPIO value and the other is checking the cluster
number of the first cpu. I selected the latter because it's more easier
than the former.

ARM: 8425/1: kgdb: Don't try to stop the machine when setting breakpoints
commit 7ae85dc7687c7e7119053d83d02c560ea217b772 upstream.
In (23a4e40 arm: kgdb: Handle read-only text / modules) we moved to
using patch\_text() to set breakpoints so that we could handle the case
when we had CONFIG\_DEBUG\_RODATA. That patch used patch\_text().
Unfortunately, patch\_text() assumes that we're not in atomic context
when it runs since it needs to grab a mutex and also wait for other
CPUs to stop (which it does with a completion).
This would result in a stack crawl if you had
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_ATOMIC\_SLEEP and tried to set a breakpoint in kgdb. The
crawl looked something like:
BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/0/0/0x00010007

instead directly call \_\_patch\_text() which assumes that CPUs have
already been stopped.

ARM: 8429/1: disable GCC SRA optimization
commit a077224fd35b2f7fbc93f14cf67074fc792fbac2 upstream.
While working on the 32-bit ARM port of UEFI, I noticed a strange
corruption in the kernel log. The following snprintf() statement
(in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c:efi\_md\_typeattr\_format())
snprintf(pos, size, "|%3s|%2s|%2s|%2s|%3s|%2s|%2s|%2s|%2s]",
was producing the following output in the log:
| | | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]
| | | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]
| | | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]
|RUN| | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]\*
|RUN| | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]\*

|RUN| | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]\*
| | | | | |WB|WT|WC|UC]
|RUN| | | | | | | |UC]
|RUN| | | | | | | |UC]
As it turns out, this is caused by incorrect code being emitted for
the string() function in lib/vsprintf.c. The following code
if (!(spec.flags & LEFT)) {
while (len < spec.field\_width--) {
if (buf < end)
\*buf = ' ';
++buf;
}
}
for (i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
if (buf < end)
\*buf = \*s;
++buf; ++s;
}
while (len < spec.field\_width--) {
if (buf < end)
\*buf = ' ';
++buf;
}
when called with len == 0, triggers an issue in the GCC SRA optimization
pass (Scalar Replacement of Aggregates), which handles promotion of signed
struct members incorrectly. This is a known but as yet unresolved issue.
(https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=65932). In this particular
case, it is causing the second while loop to be executed erroneously a
single time, causing the additional space characters to be printed.
So disable the optimization by passing -fno-ipa-sra.

ARM: fix Thumb2 signal handling when ARMv6 is enabled
commit 9b55613f42e8d40d5c9ccb8970bde6af4764b2ab upstream.
When a kernel is built covering ARMv6 to ARMv7, we omit to clear the
IT state when entering a signal handler. This can cause the first
few instructions to be conditionally executed depending on the parent
context.
In any case, the original test for >= ARMv7 is broken - ARMv6 can have
Thumb-2 support as well, and an ARMv6T2 specific build would omit this
code too.
Relax the test back to ARMv6 or greater. This results in us always
clearing the IT state bits in the PSR, even on CPUs where these bits
are reserved. However, they're reserved for the IT state, so this
should cause no harm.

sched: access local runqueue directly in single\_task\_running
commit 00cc1633816de8c95f337608a1ea64e228faf771 upstream.
Commit 2ee507c47293 ("sched: Add function single\_task\_running to let a task
check if it is the only task running on a cpu") referenced the current
runqueue with the smp\_processor\_id. When CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PREEMPT is enabled,
that is only allowed if preemption is disabled or the currrent task is
bound to the local cpu (e.g. kernel worker).
With commit f78195129963 ("kvm: add halt\_poll\_ns module parameter") KVM
calls single\_task\_running. If CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PREEMPT is enabled that
generates a lot of kernel messages.
To avoid adding preemption in that cases, as it would limit the usefulness,
we change single\_task\_running to access directly the cpu local runqueue.

perf probe: Use existing routine to look for a kernel module by dso->short\_name
commit 266fa2b22294909ddf6e7d2f8acfe07adf9fd978 upstream.
We have map\_groups\_\_find\_by\_name() to look at the list of modules that
are in place for a given machine, so use it instead of traversing the
machine dso list, which also includes DSOs for userspace.
When merging the user and kernel DSO lists a bug was introduced where
'perf probe' stopped being able to add probes to modules using its short
name:
# perf probe -m usbnet --add usbnet\_start\_xmit
usbnet\_start\_xmit is out of .text, skip it.
Error: Failed to add events.
#
With this fix it works again:
# perf probe -m usbnet --add usbnet\_start\_xmit
Added new event:
probe:usbnet\_start\_xmit (on usbnet\_start\_xmit in usbnet)
You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:
perf record -e probe:usbnet\_start\_xmit -aR sleep 1

# perf record usleep 1
# perf report --header-only | grep 'nrcpus \(online\|avail\)'
# nrcpus online : 4

perf tools: Add empty Build files for architectures lacking them
commit 93df8a1ed6231727c5db94a80b1a6bd5ee67cec3 upstream.
perf currently fails to build on MIPS as there is no
tools/perf/arch/mips/Build file. Adding an empty file fixes this as
there are no MIPS-specific sources to build.
It looks like the same is needed for Alpha and PA-RISC, though I
haven't been able to test those.

perf stat: Get correct cpu id for print\_aggr
commit 601083cffb7cabdcc55b8195d732f0f7028570fa upstream.
print\_aggr() fails to print per-core/per-socket statistics after commit
582ec0829b3d ("perf stat: Fix per-socket output bug for uncore events")
if events have differnt cpus. Because in print\_aggr(), aggr\_get\_id needs
index (not cpu id) to find core/pkg id. Also, evsel cpu maps should be
used to get aggregated id.
Here is an example:
Counting events cycles,uncore\_imc\_0/cas\_count\_read/. (Uncore event has
cpumask 0,18)
$ perf stat -e cycles,uncore\_imc\_0/cas\_count\_read/ -C0,18 --per-core sleep 2
Without this patch, it failes to get CPU 18 result.
Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0,18':
S0-C0 1 7526851 cycles
S0-C0 1 1.05 MiB uncore\_imc\_0/cas\_count\_read/
S1-C0 0  cycles
S1-C0 0  MiB uncore\_imc\_0/cas\_count\_read/
With this patch, it can get both CPU0 and CPU18 result.
Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0,18':
S0-C0 1 6327768 cycles

perf hists: Update the column width for the "srcline" sort key
commit e8e6d37e73e6b950c891c780745460b87f4755b6 upstream.
When we introduce a new sort key, we need to update the
hists\_\_calc\_col\_len() function accordingly, otherwise the width
will be limited to strlen(header).
We can't update it when obtaining a line value for a column (for
instance, in sort\_\_srcline\_cmp()), because we reset it all when doing a
resort (see hists\_\_output\_recalc\_col\_len()), so we need to, from what is
in the hist\_entry fields, set each of the column widths.

perf tools: Fix copying of /proc/kcore
commit b5cabbcbd157a4bf5a92dfc85134999a3b55342d upstream.
A copy of /proc/kcore containing the kernel text can be made to the
buildid cache. e.g.
perf buildid-cache -v -k /proc/kcore
To workaround objdump limitations, a copy is also made when annotating
against /proc/kcore.
The copying process stops working from libelf about v1.62 onwards (the
problem was found with v1.63).
The cause is that a call to gelf\_getphdr() in kcore\_\_add\_phdr() fails
because additional validation has been added to gelf\_getphdr().
The use of gelf\_getphdr() is a misguided attempt to get default
initialization of the Gelf\_Phdr structure. That should not be
necessary because every member of the Gelf\_Phdr structure is
subsequently assigned. So just remove the call to gelf\_getphdr().
Similarly, a call to gelf\_getehdr() in gelf\_kcore\_\_init() can be
removed also.
Committer notes:
Note to stable@kernel.org, from Adrian in the cover letter for this
patchkit:
The "Fix copying of /proc/kcore" problem goes back to v3.13 if you think
it is important enough for stable.

toshiba\_acpi: Fix hotkeys registration on some toshiba models
commit 53147b6cabee5e8d1997b5682fcc0c3b72ddf9c2 upstream.
Commit a2b3471b5b13 ("toshiba\_acpi: Use the Hotkey Event Type function
for keymap choosing") changed the \*setup\_keyboard function to query for
the Hotkey Event Type to help choose the correct keymap, but turns out
that here are certain Toshiba models out there not implementing this
feature, and thus, failing to continue the input device registration and
leaving such laptops without hotkey support.
This patch changes such check, and instead of returning an error if
the Hotkey Event Type is not present, we simply inform userspace about it,
changing the message printed from err to notice, making the function
responsible for registering the input device to continue.
This issue was found on a Toshiba Portege Z30-B, but there might be
some other models out there affected by this regression as well.

iser-target: Put the reference on commands waiting for unsol data
commit 3e03c4b01da3e6a5f3081eb0aa252490fe83e352 upstream.
The iscsi target core teardown sequence calls wait\_conn for
all active commands to finish gracefully by:
- move the queue-pair to error state
- drain all the completions
- wait for the core to finish handling all session commands
However, when tearing down a session while there are sequenced
commands that are still waiting for unsolicited data outs, we can
block forever as these are missing an extra reference put.
We basically need the equivalent of iscsit\_free\_queue\_reqs\_for\_conn()
which is called after wait\_conn has returned. Address this by an
explicit walk on conn\_cmd\_list and put the extra reference.

target: Fix PR registration + APTPL RCU conversion regression
commit 3ccd6e83df8a0d4a664edeecc453c4fa046395fb upstream.
This patch fixes a v4.2+ regression introduced by commit 79dc9c9e86
where lookup of t10\_pr\_registration->pr\_reg\_deve and associated
->pr\_kref get was missing from \_\_core\_scsi3\_do\_alloc\_registration(),
which is responsible for setting DEF\_PR\_REG\_ACTIVE.
This would result in REGISTER operations completing successfully,
but subsequent core\_scsi3\_pr\_seq\_non\_holder() checking would fail
with !DEF\_PR\_REG\_ACTIVE -> RESERVATION CONFLICT status.
Update \_\_core\_scsi3\_add\_registration() to drop ->pr\_kref reference
after registration and any optional ALL\_TG\_PT=1 processing has
completed. Update core\_scsi3\_decode\_spec\_i\_port() to release
the new parent local\_pr\_reg->pr\_kref as well.
Also, update \_\_core\_scsi3\_check\_aptpl\_registration() to perform
the same target\_nacl\_find\_deve() lookup + ->pr\_kref get, now that
\_\_core\_scsi3\_add\_registration() expects to drop the reference.
Finally, since there are cases when se\_dev\_entry->se\_lun\_acl can
still be dereferenced in core\_scsi3\_lunacl\_undepend\_item() while
holding ->pr\_kref, go ahead and move explicit rcu\_assign\_pointer()
NULL assignments within core\_disable\_device\_list\_for\_node() until
after orig->pr\_comp finishes.

This patch is a >= v4.1 regression bug-fix where control CDB

To address this bug, go ahead and add locally generated se\_cmd
descriptors for copy-offload block-copy to it's own stand-alone
se\_session nexus, while the parent EXTENDED\_COPY se\_cmd descriptor
remains associated with it's originating se\_cmd->se\_sess nexus.
Note a valid se\_cmd->se\_sess is also required for future support
of WRITE\_INSERT and READ\_STRIP software emulation when submitting
backend I/O to se\_device that exposes T10-PI suport.

scsi: fix scsi\_error\_handler vs. scsi\_host\_dev\_release race
commit 537b604c8b3aa8b96fe35f87dd085816552e294c upstream.
b9d5c6b7ef57 ("[SCSI] cleanup setting task state in
scsi\_error\_handler()") has introduced a race between scsi\_error\_handler
and scsi\_host\_dev\_release resulting in the hang when the device goes
away because scsi\_error\_handler might miss a wake up:
CPU0 CPU1
scsi\_error\_handler scsi\_host\_dev\_release
kthread\_stop()
kthread\_should\_stop()
test\_bit(KTHREAD\_SHOULD\_STOP)
set\_bit(KTHREAD\_SHOULD\_STOP)
wake\_up\_process()
wait\_for\_completion()
set\_current\_state(TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE)
schedule()
The most straightforward solution seems to be to invert the ordering of
the set\_current\_state and kthread\_should\_stop.
The issue has been noticed during reboot test on a 3.0 based kernel but
the current code seems to be affected in the same way.

time: Fix timekeeping\_freqadjust()'s incorrect use of abs() instead of abs64()
commit 2619d7e9c92d524cb155ec89fd72875321512e5b upstream.
The internal clocksteering done for fine-grained error
correction uses a logarithmic approximation, so any time
adjtimex() adjusts the clock steering, timekeeping\_freqadjust()
quickly approximates the correct clock frequency over a series
of ticks.
Unfortunately, the logic in timekeeping\_freqadjust(), introduced
in commit:
dc491596f639 ("timekeeping: Rework frequency adjustments to work better w/ nohz")
used the abs() function with a s64 error value to calculate the
size of the approximated adjustment to be made.
Per include/linux/kernel.h:
"abs() should not be used for 64-bit types (s64, u64, long long) - use abs64()".
Thus on 32-bit platforms, this resulted in the clocksteering to
take a quite dampended random walk trying to converge on the
proper frequency, which caused the adjustments to be made much
slower then intended (most easily observed when large
adjustments are made).
This patch fixes the issue by using abs64() instead.

commit 7e022e717f54897e396504306d0c9b61452adf4e upstream.
In guest\_exit\_cont we call kvmhv\_commence\_exit which expects the trap
number as the argument. However r3 doesn't contain the trap number at
this point and as a result we would be calling the function with a
spurious trap number.
Fix this by copying r12 into r3 before calling kvmhv\_commence\_exit as
r12 contains the trap number.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Take the kvm->srcu lock in kvmppc\_h\_logical\_ci\_load/store()
commit 3eb4ee68254235e4f47bc0410538fcdaede39589 upstream.
Access to the kvm->buses (like with the kvm\_io\_bus\_read() and -write()
functions) has to be protected via the kvm->srcu lock.
The kvmppc\_h\_logical\_ci\_load() and -store() functions are missing
this lock so far, so let's add it there, too.
This fixes the problem that the kernel reports "suspicious RCU usage"
when lock debugging is enabled.

KVM: x86: trap AMD MSRs for the TSeg base and mask
commit 3afb1121800128aae9f5722e50097fcf1a9d4d88 upstream.
These have roughly the same purpose as the SMRR, which we do not need
to implement in KVM. However, Linux accesses MSR\_K8\_TSEG\_ADDR at
boot, which causes problems when running a Xen dom0 under KVM.
Just return 0, meaning that processor protection of SMRAM is not
in effect.

kvm: svm: reset mmu on VCPU reset
commit ebae871a509d3c24b32ff67af2671dadffc58770 upstream.
When INIT/SIPI sequence is sent to VCPU which before that
was in use by OS, VMRUN might fail with:

with corresponding SVM error:

cr3: 0000000187d0c000 cr4: 0000000000000020

What happens is that VCPU state right after offlinig:
CR0: 0x80050033 EFER: 0xd01 CR4: 0x7e0
-> long mode with CR3 pointing to longmode page tables
and when VCPU gets INIT/SIPI following transition happens
CR0: 0 -> 0x60000010 EFER: 0x0 CR4: 0x7e0
-> paging disabled with stale CR3
However SVM under the hood puts VCPU in Paged Real Mode\*
which effectively translates CR0 0x60000010 -> 80010010 after
svm\_vcpu\_reset()
-> init\_vmcb()
-> kvm\_set\_cr0()
-> svm\_set\_cr0()
but from kvm\_set\_cr0() perspective CR0: 0 -> 0x60000010
only caching bits are changed and
commit d81135a57aa6
("KVM: x86: do not reset mmu if CR0.CD and CR0.NW are changed")'
regressed svm\_vcpu\_reset() which relied on MMU being reset.
As result VMRUN after svm\_vcpu\_reset() tries to run
VCPU in Paged Real Mode with stale MMU context (longmode page tables),
which causes some AMD CPUs\*\* to bail out with VMEXIT\_INVALID.
Fix issue by unconditionally resetting MMU context
at init\_vmcb() time.

arm: KVM: Disable virtual timer even if the guest is not using it
commit 688bc577ac42ae3d07c889a1f0a72f0b23763d58 upstream.
When running a guest with the architected timer disabled (with QEMU and
the kernel\_irqchip=off option, for example), it is important to make
sure the timer gets turned off. Otherwise, the guest may try to
enable it anyway, leading to a screaming HW interrupt.
The fix is to unconditionally turn off the virtual timer on guest
exit.

kvm: fix double free for fast mmio eventfd
commit eefd6b06b17c5478e7c24bea6f64beaa2c431ca6 upstream.
We register wildcard mmio eventfd on two buses, once for KVM\_MMIO\_BUS
and once on KVM\_FAST\_MMIO\_BUS but with a single iodev
instance. This will lead to an issue: kvm\_io\_bus\_destroy() knows
nothing about the devices on two buses pointing to a single dev. Which
will lead to double free[1] during exit. Fix this by allocating two
instances of iodevs then registering one on KVM\_MMIO\_BUS and another
on KVM\_FAST\_MMIO\_BUS.

Currently, if we had a zero length mmio eventfd assigned on
KVM\_MMIO\_BUS. It will never be found by kvm\_io\_bus\_cmp() since it
always compares the kvm\_io\_range() with the length that guest
wrote. This will cause e.g for vhost, kick will be trapped by qemu
userspace instead of vhost. Fixing this by using zero length if an
iodevice is zero length.

KVM: vmx: fix VPID is 0000H in non-root operation
commit 04bb92e4b4cf06a66889d37b892b78f926faa9d4 upstream.
Reference SDM 28.1:
The current VPID is 0000H in the following situations:
- Outside VMX operation. (This includes operation in system-management
mode under the default treatment of SMIs and SMM with VMX operation;
see Section 34.14.)
- In VMX root operation.
- In VMX non-root operation when the “enable VPID” VM-execution control
is 0.
The VPID should never be 0000H in non-root operation when "enable VPID"
VM-execution control is 1. However, commit 34a1cd60 ("kvm: x86: vmx:
move some vmx setting from vmx\_init() to hardware\_setup()") remove the
codes which reserve 0000H for VMX root operation.
This patch fix it by again reserving 0000H for VMX root operation.

arm: KVM: Fix incorrect device to IPA mapping
commit ca09f02f122b2ecb0f5ddfc5fd47b29ed657d4fd upstream.
A critical bug has been found in device memory stage1 translation for
VMs with more then 4GB of address space. Once vm\_pgoff size is smaller
then pa (which is true for LPAE case, u32 and u64 respectively) some
more significant bits of pa may be lost as a shift operation is performed
on u32 and later cast onto u64.
Example: vm\_pgoff(u32)=0x00210030, PAGE\_SHIFT=12
expected pa(u64): 0x0000002010030000
produced pa(u64): 0x0000000010030000
The fix is to change the order of operations (casting first onto phys\_addr\_t
and then shifting).

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2925 CVE-2015-5257 CVE-2015-5283 CVE-2015-7613

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, unauthorised
information disclosure or unauthorised information modification.

CVE-2015-2925

    Jann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem was
    bind-mounted into a chroot or mount namespace, a user that should
    be confined to that chroot or namespace could access the whole of
    that filesystem if they had write permission on an ancestor of
    the subdirectory.  This is not a common configuration for wheezy,
    and the issue has previously been fixed for jessie.

CVE-2015-5257

    Moein Ghasemzadeh of Istuary Innovation Labs reported that a USB
    device could cause a denial of service (crash) by imitating a
    Whiteheat USB serial device but presenting a smaller number of
    endpoints.

CVE-2015-5283

    Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered that creating multiple SCTP
    sockets at the same time could cause a denial of service (crash)
    if the sctp module had not previously been loaded.  This issue
    only affects jessie.

CVE-2015-7613

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered that System V IPC objects (message queues
    and shared memory segments) were made accessible before their
    ownership and other attributes were fully initialised.  If a local
    user can race against another user or service creating a new IPC
    object, this may result in unauthorised information disclosure,
    unauthorised information modification, denial of service and/or
    privilege escalation.

    A similar issue existed with System V semaphore arrays, but was
    less severe because they were always cleared before being fully
    initialised.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
