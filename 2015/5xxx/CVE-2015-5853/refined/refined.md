- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the processing of eSCL packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of eSCL packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position may be able to extract the payload from eSCL packets sent over a secure connection.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs over the network by intercepting and analyzing eSCL packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a privileged network position to intercept network traffic.
