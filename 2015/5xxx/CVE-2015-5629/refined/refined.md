Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a URL whitelist bypass in the "Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi" application. Specifically, the application doesn't properly restrict which URLs it can load when launched with a URL-scheme. This allows arbitrary pages to be loaded, bypassing the intended whitelist restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Whitelist Bypass:** The application fails to enforce its URL whitelist, enabling the loading of arbitrary URLs.
- **Improper Permissions Handling:** On Android, the vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary APIs if the application has the necessary permissions in its manifest.
- **Arbitrary API Execution:** Both Android and iOS versions could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Page Loading:** An attacker can force the application to load arbitrary web pages.
- **Arbitrary API Execution:**  Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary APIs, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify application settings, or perform other malicious actions depending on the application's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL-scheme Launch:** The vulnerability is triggered by launching the application using a crafted URL-scheme.
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based as the malicious URL can be delivered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious URL to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of URL-scheme:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific URL-scheme used by the application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected both Android and iOS versions of the "Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi" app.
- The vulnerability was not completely addressed by the versions released in July 2015.
- The fix involved updating the app to the latest version, which included a content update provided on April 26, 2016.
