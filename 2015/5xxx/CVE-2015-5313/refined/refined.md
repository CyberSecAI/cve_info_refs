  "CVE-2015-5313": {
    "description": "A path-traversal flaw was found in the way the libvirt daemon handled filesystem names for storage volumes. A libvirt user with privileges to create storage volumes and without privileges to create and modify domains could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The libvirt daemon, when using the virStorageVol APIs, concatenated user-supplied volume names to the pool location without proper validation, allowing for directory traversal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory Traversal",
        "Insufficient Input Validation",
         "ACL Bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated local user with `storage_vol:create` permissions, but without `domain:write` permissions, can create or access arbitrary files outside of the designated storage pool.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a local user account with `storage_vol:create` permissions granted through ACLs but not `domain:write` permissions.",
        "affected_products": [
          "libvirt", "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7", "Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1"
         ]
    },
      "additional_notes": {
            "red_hat_note": "In libvirt 1.1.0 and later, i.e. also in libvirt version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, it is possible to grant finer grained privileges and hence grant user privilege to create storage volumes without allowing them to create or modify domains. In configurations using such ACL settings, this may allow privilege escalation.  Lowering impact rating to Moderate as this is limited to specific non-default configurations.",
            "gentoo_note": "In Gentoo, libvirtâ€™s ACL support is disabled by default unless you enable the 'policykit' USE flag.",
             "libvirt_note": "The virStoragePoolListVolumes API, when used on a storage pool backed by a directory in a file system, will only list volumes immediately in that directory (there is no traversal into subdirectories). However, other APIs such as virStorageVolCreateXML were not checking if a potential volume name represented one of the volumes that could be returned by virStoragePoolListVolumes; because they were not rejecting the use of '/' in a volume name."
