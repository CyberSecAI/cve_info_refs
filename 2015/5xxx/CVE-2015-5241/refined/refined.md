Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-5241:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `logout.jsp` page of the portlet-based user interface (also known as 'Pluto', 'jUDDI Portal', 'UDDI Portal', or 'uddi-console'). After a user logs out, this page redirects the browser back to the login page using a URL parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The `logout.jsp` page accepts a `urlredirect` parameter, which is used to redirect the browser after logout. The lack of sanitization or validation of the provided URL parameter allows a malicious user to redirect the browser to an arbitrary web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can redirect the logged-out user to a phishing site or another malicious website by providing a crafted `urlredirect` parameter. This could lead to credential theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities if the attacker successfully impersonates a legitimate site. Although the user's session is cleared before redirect, a well-crafted phishing or malicious site may still trick users.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user crafts a URL with a specific `urlredirect` parameter value pointing to a malicious website. This malicious URL is used to initiate the logout process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link, which can then be provided to an authenticated user to trick them into logging out via the vulnerable `logout.jsp` page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the jUDDI portal itself, but needs to trick a legitimate user of the portal into clicking the malicious link to log out and get redirected.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in jUDDI versions 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 when using the portlet-based user interface.
- The issue is resolved in jUDDI versions 3.2 and newer which have replaced the affected user interface.
- The provided mitigation suggests either removing the vulnerable portlet interface or modifying the `logout.jsp` to hardcode the redirection to `/pluto/Logout`.
