Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5377

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the transport protocol of Elasticsearch. It is related to the Groovy deserialization issue described in CVE-2015-3253.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of Java serialized binary streams within the Closure implementation of Apache Groovy.
- Lack of proper validation of classes being deserialized, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Elasticsearch installations.
- This code execution occurs within the context of the user running the Elasticsearch process.
- The vulnerability is exploitable even when Groovy dynamic scripting is disabled in Elasticsearch.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the transport protocol of Elasticsearch, which is used for communication between nodes in a cluster.
- An attacker can send a specially crafted serialized object through this protocol, triggering the deserialization vulnerability.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the transport protocol port (default 9300) of the Elasticsearch instance.
- They need to be able to craft a malicious serialized object that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.6.1.
- Versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 address this vulnerability.
- A patch was made to restrict the classes allowed for deserialization to core and selected JDK classes to ensure they are present on both source and target nodes. This prevents the deserialization of arbitrary classes that could lead to code execution.
- Mitigation can also be achieved by securing the transport protocol port to only allow trusted agents.
- The vulnerability was discovered by cpnrodzc7 working with HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
