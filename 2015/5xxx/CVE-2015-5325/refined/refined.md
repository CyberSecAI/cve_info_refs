{
  "CVE-2015-5325": {
    "Description": "JNLP agents were not subject to the optional agent-to-controller access control, allowing a malicious user to bypass intended access controls.",
    "Root cause": "The JNLP agent connection process in Jenkins did not enforce the agent-to-controller access control mechanism.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Bypass of intended security mechanisms"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user could connect their own machine as a Jenkins agent to the controller, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information (keys, source code) and potentially taking over the Jenkins instance.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network connection via JNLP to a vulnerable Jenkins instance.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs knowledge of the agent's name, and network access to connect to the Jenkins controller."
  }
