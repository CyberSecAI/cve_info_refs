  },
  "details": "This vulnerability was addressed in Jenkins versions 1.638 and 1.625.2 and Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1, and 2.2.9. The vulnerability stems from how Jenkins handles file fingerprints, allowing unauthorized users to potentially view project names through the \"Fingerprints\" page when these projects share fingerprints."
