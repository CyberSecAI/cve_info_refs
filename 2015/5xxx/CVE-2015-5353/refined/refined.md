Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-5353:

**Root Cause:** The Novius CMS application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `media_title` and `menu_title`.
    *   The application stores unsanitized user input in the database (MySQL). When this data is retrieved and rendered in a web page, malicious JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser.
    *   Specifically, XSS payloads can be injected via the 'media_title' field in the Media Center and the 'menu_title' field when creating or editing website menus.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `tab`.
    *   The application allows directory traversal via the `tab` parameter in the admin area. Attackers can use this to access and read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Open Redirect:**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `redirect`.
    *   The application uses the `redirect` parameter in the login page to redirect users. However, it doesn't validate the provided URL, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the browser of other users, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Theft of sensitive information.
*   **LFI:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files on the server, potentially including:
    *   Configuration files with database credentials.
    *   Source code.
    *   Other system files, possibly leading to further compromise.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker can redirect legitimate users to a malicious website, potentially leading to:
    *   Phishing attacks.
    *   Malware distribution.
    *   Compromise of user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code via vulnerable input fields in the application's administrative interface (Media Center, Website Menu).
*   **LFI:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the administrative interface using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) in the `tab` parameter.
*   **Open Redirect:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the login page with a malicious URL in the `redirect` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** Requires an authenticated user account to access the administrative interface of the vulnerable application.
*   **LFI:** Requires access to the administrative interface of the vulnerable application.
*   **Open Redirect:**  The attacker can exploit this without needing to be logged into the application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content references `CVE-2015-5354`, but the analysis focuses on the vulnerabilities related to `CVE-2015-5353` based on the available details.
*   The advisory mentions that the XSS payloads are stored in the database and executed upon access, classifying them as persistent XSS.
*   The LFI vulnerability allows for directory traversal using relative path (`../`) notation.
*   The affected areas are the login page, web pages, Media Center, and Website Menu area of the application.
*   The application is based on PHP.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on June 29, 2015.
*   The severity level is considered "Medium".
