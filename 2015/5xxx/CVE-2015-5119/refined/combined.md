| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1241171#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-08 16:03:51 UTC  ``` Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-16 for Adobe Flash Player describes multiple flaws that can possibly lead to code execution when Flash Player is used to play a specially crafted SWF file.  Quoting from the APSB15-16:  These updates resolve heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution ([CVE-2015-3135](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3135), [CVE-2015-4432](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4432), [CVE-2015-5118](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5118)).  These updates resolve memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution ([CVE-2015-3117](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3117), [CVE-2015-3123](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3123), [CVE-2015-3130](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3130), [CVE-2015-3133](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3133), [CVE-2015-3134](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3134), [CVE-2015-4431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4431)).  These updates resolve type confusion vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution ([CVE-2015-3119](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3119), [CVE-2015-3120](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3120), [CVE-2015-3121](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3121), [CVE-2015-3122](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3122), [CVE-2015-4433](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4433)).  These updates resolve use-after-free vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution ([CVE-2015-3118](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3118), [CVE-2015-3124](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3124), [CVE-2015-5117](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5117), [CVE-2015-3127](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3127), [CVE-2015-3128](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3128), [CVE-2015-3129](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3129), [CVE-2015-3131](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3131), [CVE-2015-3132](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3132), [CVE-2015-3136](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3136), [CVE-2015-3137](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3137), [CVE-2015-4428](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4428), [CVE-2015-4430](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4430), [CVE-2015-5119](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5119)).  Note that [CVE-2015-5119](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5119) is already tracked via a separate [bug 1240832](show_bug.cgi?id=1240832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5119 flash-plugin: code execution issue in APSA15-03 / APSB15-16").  The Bulletin also describes the following issue:  These updates resolve null pointer dereference issues ([CVE-2015-3126](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3126), [CVE-2015-4429](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4429)).  It does clarify if these are limited to crash as most NULL pointer dereference issues, or can have higher impact.

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-16
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-3117, CVE-2015-3118, CVE-2015-3119, CVE-2015-3120,
CVE-2015-3121, CVE-2015-3122, CVE-2015-3123, CVE-2015-3124, CVE-2015-3126,
CVE-2015-3127, CVE-2015-3128, CVE-2015-3129, CVE-2015-3130, CVE-2015-3131,
CVE-2015-3132, CVE-2015-3133, CVE-2015-3134, CVE-2015-3135, CVE-2015-3136,
CVE-2015-3137, CVE-2015-4428, CVE-2015-4429, CVE-2015-4430, CVE-2015-4431,
CVE-2015-4432, CVE-2015-4433, CVE-2015-5117, CVE-2015-5118, CVE-2015-5119)

Multiple security bypass flaws were found in flash-plugin that could lead
to the disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0578, CVE-2015-3114,
CVE-2015-3115, CVE-2015-3116, CVE-2015-3125, CVE-2015-5116)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.481.

## Adobe Flash ActionScript 3 BitmapData memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#918568

Original Release Date: 2015-07-12 | Last Revised: 2015-07-14

---

### Overview

Adobe Flash Player contains a vulnerability in the ActionScript 3 BitmapData object, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Adobe Flash Player versions 9.0 through version 18.0.0.204 contain amemory corruption vulnerability in the [AS3 BitmapData class](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/BitmapData.html). Proof-of-concept exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.  Please see Adobe Security Bulletin [APSA15-04](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa15-04.html) for more details about affected Flash versions. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running Flash Player. Attacks typically involve enticing a user to visit a web site containing specially-crafted Flash content, or to open a specially-crafted Microsoft Office document. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Flash Player Desktop 18.0.0.209. See Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html) for more details. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Do not run untrusted Flash content**To defend against this and other, as yet unknown vulnerabilities, disable Flash in your browser or enable [Click-to-Play](http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser) features. Adobe has also provided instructions for how to [uninstall Flash on Windows](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html) and [Mac](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html) platforms.**Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/emet) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. In particular, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) can be configured to help restrict Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer from loading the Flash ActiveX control. |

Alert
# Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 29, 2016
Alert CodeTA15-195A

### Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows systems with Adobe Flash Player installed.

### Overview

Used in conjunction, recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. Since attackers continue to target and find new vulnerabilities in popular, Internet-facing software, updating is not sufficient, and it is important to use exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

The following vulnerabilities illustrate the need for ongoing mitigation techniques and prioritization of updates for highly targeted software:

* Adobe Flash use-after-free and memory corruption vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) Adobe Flash Player contains critical vulnerabilities within the ActionScript 3 ByteArray, opaqueBackground and BitmapData classes. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
* Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2015-2387](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2387))
  The Adobe Type Manager module contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to obtain system privileges on an affected Windows system. The Adobe Type Manager is a Microsoft Windows component present in every version since NT 4.0. The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is local privilege escalation.

#### Vulnerability Chaining

By convincing a user to visit a website or open a file containing specially crafted Flash content, an attacker could combine any one of the three Adobe Flash vulnerabilities with the Microsoft Windows vulnerability to take full control of an affected system.

A common attack vector for exploiting a Flash vulnerability is to entice a user to load Flash content in a web browser, and most web browsers have Flash installed and enabled. A second attack vector for Flash vulnerabilities is through a file (such as an email attachment) that embeds Flash content. Another technique leverages Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) capabilities in Microsoft Office documents to automatically download Flash content from a remote server.

An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code through the Flash vulnerability could exploit the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability to gain elevated system privileges. The Adobe Type Manager vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass sandbox defenses (such as those found in Adobe Reader and Google Chrome) and low integrity protections (such as Protected Mode Internet Explorer and Protected View for Microsoft Office).

### Impact

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Exploitation of the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability could then allow the attacker to execute code with system privileges.

### Solution

Since attackers regularly target widely deployed, Internet-accessible software such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows, it is important to prioritize updates for these products to defend against known vulnerabilities.

Since attackers regularly discover new vulnerabilities for which updates do not exist, it is important to enable exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

#### Apply Security Updates

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) are addressed in Adobe Security Bulletins [APSB15-16](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html) and [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletins and apply the necessary updates.

The Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) is addressed in Microsoft security Bulletin [MS15-077](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-077). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletin and apply the necessary updates.

Additional information regarding the vulnerabilities can be found in Vulnerability Notes [VU#561288](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/561288), [VU#338736](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/338736), [VU#918568](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918568), and [VU#103336](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103336).

#### Limit Flash Content

Do not run untrusted Flash content. Most web browsers have Flash enabled by default, however, it may be possible to enable click-to-play features. For information see  <http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/>

#### **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)**

## Adobe Flash ActionScript 3 opaqueBackground use-after-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#338736

Original Release Date: 2015-07-11 | Last Revised: 2015-07-14

---

### Overview

Adobe Flash Player contains a vulnerability in the ActionScript 3 opaqueBackground property, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Adobe Flash Player versions 9.0 through version 18.0.0.204 contain a use-after-free vulnerability in the [AS3 opaqueBackground class](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/DisplayObject.html#opaqueBackground). This can allow attacker-controlled memory corruption. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.  Please see Adobe Security Bulletin [APSA15-04](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa15-04.html) for more details about affected Flash versions. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running Flash Player. Attacks typically involve enticing a user to visit a web site containing specially-crafted Flash content, or to open a specially-crafted Microsoft Office document. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Flash Player Desktop 18.0.0.209. See Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html) for more details. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Do not run untrusted Flash content**To defend against this and other, as yet unknown vulnerabilities, disable Flash in your browser or enable [Click-to-Play](http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser) features. Adobe has also provided instructions for how to [uninstall Flash on Windows](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html) and [Mac](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html) platforms.**Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/emet) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. In particular, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) can be configured to help restrict Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer from loading the Flash ActiveX control. |
