- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Belkin N600 routers contain a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by inducing a victim user with an active session to trigger a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce an authenticated user into making an unintentional request to the web server and can leverage a lack of password protection on the web interface to establish a session as part of the attack.
