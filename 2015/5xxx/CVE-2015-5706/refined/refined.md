{
  "CVE-2015-5706": {
    "Description": "A double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's path lookup. A local user could cause a denial of service (Oops).",
    "Root cause": "The `path_openat()` function in the Linux kernel jumps to the wrong place after `do_tmpfile()`, leading to a double call to `path_cleanup()`. Because `path_cleanup()` includes a call to `fput()` on a file structure, this can lead to a double free.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double Free",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user could cause a denial of service (Oops). The use-after-free can cause unexpected behavior or system crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access is required"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Unprivileged local user",
       "Ability to trigger a specific code path using O_TMPFILE flag"
    ],
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions 3.11 to 4.0, and was fixed in version 4.1-rc3 with commit f15133df088ecadd141ea1907f2c96df67c729f0. The issue arises from an incorrect jump after calling `do_tmpfile()`, which results in calling `path_cleanup()` twice, leading to the double free."
