path\_openat(): fix double fput()

```
path_openat() jumps to the wrong place after do_tmpfile() - it has
already done path_cleanup() (as part of path_lookupat() called by
do_tmpfile()), so doing that again can lead to double fput().

# USN-2681-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

23 July 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs

in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their

privileges. ([CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805))

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's

kvm\_apic\_has\_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](/security/CVE-2015-4692))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter

JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](/security/CVE-2015-4700))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

A double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's path lookup. A

local user could cause a denial of service (Oops). ([CVE-2015-5706](/security/CVE-2015-5706))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

There are code pieces converting pointers using "(acpi\_physical\_address) x"

Known issues:
1. Cleanup of "(ACPI\_PHYSICAL\_ADDRRESS) x" for a table field
For the conversions around the table fields, it is better to fix it with
alignment also fixed. So this patch doesn't modify such code. There
should be no functional problem by leaving them unchanged.

sound/oss: fix deadlock in sequencer\_ioctl(SNDCTL\_SEQ\_OUTOFBAND)
commit bc26d4d06e337ade069f33d3f4377593b24e6e36 upstream.
A deadlock can be initiated by userspace via ioctl(SNDCTL\_SEQ\_OUTOFBAND)
on /dev/sequencer with TMR\_ECHO midi event.
In this case the control flow is:
sound\_ioctl()
-> case SND\_DEV\_SEQ:
case SND\_DEV\_SEQ2:
sequencer\_ioctl()
-> case SNDCTL\_SEQ\_OUTOFBAND:
spin\_lock\_irqsave(&lock,flags);
play\_event();
-> case EV\_TIMING:
seq\_timing\_event()
-> case TMR\_ECHO:
seq\_copy\_to\_input()
-> spin\_lock\_irqsave(&lock,flags);
It seems that spin\_lock\_irqsave() around play\_event() is not necessary,
because the only other call location in seq\_startplay() makes the call
without acquiring spinlock.
So, the patch just removes spinlocks around play\_event().
By the way, it removes unreachable code in seq\_timing\_event(),
since (seq\_mode == SEQ\_2) case is handled in the beginning.
Compile tested only.

arm64 builds with GCC 5 have caused the \_\_asmeq assertions in the PSCI
calling code to fire, so move the ARM PSCI calls out of line into their
own assembly file for consistency and to safeguard against the same
issue occuring with the 32-bit toolchain.

mmc: sh\_mmcif: Fix timeout value for command request
commit bad4371d87d1d1ed1aecd9c9cc21c41ac3f289c8 upstream.
f9fd54f22e ("mmc: sh\_mmcif: Use msecs\_to\_jiffies() for host->timeout")
changed the timeout value from 1000 jiffies to 1s. In the case where
HZ is 1000 the values are the same. However, for smaller HZ values the
timeout is now smaller, 1s instead of 10s in the case of HZ=100.
Since the timeout occurs in spite of a normal data transfer a timeout of
10s seems more appropriate. This restores the previous timeout in the
case where HZ=100 and results in an increase over the previous timeout
for larger values of HZ.

mmc: card: Don't access RPMB partitions for normal read/write
commit 4e93b9a6abc0d028daf3c8a00cb77b679d8a4df4 upstream.
During kernel boot, it will try to read some logical sectors
of each block device node for the possible partition table.
But since RPMB partition is special and can not be accessed
by normal eMMC read / write CMDs, it will cause below error
messages during kernel boot:
...

Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0rpmb, logical block 3
...
This patch will discard the access request in eMMC queue if
it is RPMB partition access request. By this way, it avoids
trigger above error messages.

pinctrl: Don't just pretend to protect pinctrl\_maps, do it for real
commit c5272a28566b00cce79127ad382406e0a8650690 upstream.
Way back, when the world was a simpler place and there was no war, no
evil, and no kernel bugs, there was just a single pinctrl lock. That
was how the world was when (57291ce pinctrl: core device tree mapping
table parsing support) was written. In that case, there were
instances where the pinctrl mutex was already held when
pinctrl\_register\_map() was called, hence a "locked" parameter was
passed to the function to indicate that the mutex was already locked
(so we shouldn't lock it again).
A few years ago in (42fed7b pinctrl: move subsystem mutex to
pinctrl\_dev struct), we switched to a separate pinctrl\_maps\_mutex.
...but (oops) we forgot to re-think about the whole "locked" parameter
for pinctrl\_register\_map(). Basically the "locked" parameter appears
to still refer to whether the bigger pinctrl\_dev mutex is locked, but
we're using it to skip locks of our (now separate) pinctrl\_maps\_mutex.
That's kind of a bad thing(TM). Probably nobody noticed because most
of the calls to pinctrl\_register\_map happen at boot time and we've got
synchronous device probing. ...and even cases where we're
asynchronous don't end up actually hitting the race too often. ...but
after banging my head against the wall for a bug that reproduced 1 out
of 1000 reboots and lots of looking through kgdb, I finally noticed
this.
Anyway, we can now safely remove the "locked" parameter and go back to
a war-free, evil-free, and kernel-bug-free world.

This patch fixes a bug where sdma vm wasn't initialized when
an sdma queue was created in HWS mode.
This caused GPUVM faults to appear on dmesg and it is one of the

drm/i915/dp: there is no audio on port A
commit 9fcb1704d1d51b12e2f03c78bca013d0cbbb7c98 upstream.
The eDP port A register on PCH split platforms has a slightly different
register layout from the other ports, with bit 6 being either alternate
scrambler reset or reserved, depending on the generation. Our
misinterpretation of the bit as audio has lead to warning.
Fix this by not enabling audio on port A, since none of our platforms
support audio on port A anyway.

drm/i915: Add missing MacBook Pro models with dual channel LVDS
commit 3916e3fd81021fb795bfbdb17f375b6b3685bced upstream.
Single channel LVDS maxes out at 112 MHz. The 15" pre-retina models
shipped with 1440x900 (106 MHz) by default or 1680x1050 (119 MHz)
as a BTO option, both versions used dual channel LVDS even though
the smaller one would have fit into a single channel.
Notes:
Bug report showing that the MacBookPro8,2 with 1440x900 uses dual
channel LVDS (this lead to it being hardcoded in intel\_lvds.c by
Daniel Vetter with commit 618563e3945b9d0864154bab3c607865b557cecc):
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=42842
If i915.lvds\_channel\_mode=2 is missing even though the machine needs
it, every other vertical line is white and consequently, only the left
half of the screen is visible (verified by myself on a MacBookPro9,1).
Forum posting concerning a MacBookPro6,2 with 1440x900, author is
using i915.lvds\_channel\_mode=2 on the kernel command line, proving
that the machine uses dual channels:
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=185770
Chi Mei N154C6-L04 with 1440x900 is a replacement panel for all
MacBook Pro "A1286" models, and that model number encompasses the
MacBookPro6,2 / 8,2 / 9,1. Page 17 of the panel's datasheet shows it's
driven with dual channel LVDS:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/400690878560
http://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/?search\_keywords=A1286
http://www.taopanel.com/chimei/datasheet/N154C6-L04.pdf
Those three 15" models, MacBookPro6,2 / 8,2 / 9,1, are the only ones
with i915 graphics and dual channel LVDS, so that list should be
complete. And the 8,2 is already in intel\_lvds.c.
Possible motivation to use dual channel LVDS even on the 1440x900
models: Reduce the number of different parts, i.e. use identical logic
boards and display cabling on both versions and the only differing
component is the panel.

drm/i915: Assume dual channel LVDS if pixel clock necessitates it
commit 6f317cfe42c9d8a7c9c1a327d2f1bcc517a3cd91 upstream.
Single channel LVDS maxes out at 112 MHz, anything above must be dual
channel. This avoids the need to specify i915.lvds\_channel\_mode=2 on
all 17" MacBook Pro models with i915 graphics since they had 1920x1200
(193 MHz), plus those 15" pre-retina models which had a resolution
of 1680x1050 (119 MHz) as a BTO option.
Source for 112 MHz limit of single channel LVDS is section 2.3 of:
https://01.org/linuxgraphics/sites/default/files/documentation/ivb\_ihd\_os\_vol3\_part4.pdf

drm: Zero out invalid vblank timestamp in drm\_update\_vblank\_count.
commit fdb68e09bbb1c981f24608d7022c7d93cc47b326 upstream.
Since commit 844b03f27739135fe1fed2fef06da0ffc4c7a081 we make
sure that after vblank irq off, we return the last valid
(vblank count, vblank timestamp) pair to clients, e.g., during
modesets, which is good.
An overlooked side effect of that commit for kms drivers without
support for precise vblank timestamping is that at vblank irq
enable, when we update the vblank counter from the hw counter, we
can't update the corresponding vblank timestamp, so now we have a
totally mismatched timestamp for the new count to confuse clients.
Restore old client visible behaviour from before Linux 3.17, but
zero out the timestamp at vblank counter update (instead of disable
as in original implementation) if we can't generate a meaningful
timestamp immediately for the new vblank counter. This will fix
this regression, so callers know they need to retry again later
if they need a valid timestamp, but at the same time preserves
the improvements made in the commit mentioned above.

ARM: OMAP2+: Fix omap off idle power consumption creeping up
commit 102bcb6ed2d1c3ffcc7269afc957c2df11942085 upstream.
If we use a combination of VMODE and I2C4 for retention modes,
eventually the off idle power consumption will creep up by about
23mW, even during off mode with I2C4 always staying enabled.
Turns out this is because of erratum i531 "Extra Power Consumed
When Repeated Start Operation Mode Is Enabled on I2C Interface
Dedicated for Smart Reflex (I2C4)" as pointed out by Nishanth
Menon .
Let's fix the issue by adding i2c\_cfg\_clear\_mask for the bits
to clear when initializing the I2C4 adapter so we can clear
SREN bit that drives the I2C4 lines low otherwise when there
is no traffic.

blk-mq: fix CPU hotplug handling
commit 2a34c0872adf252f23a6fef2d051a169ac796cef upstream.
hctx->tags has to be set as NULL in case that it is to be unmapped
no matter if set->tags[hctx->queue\_num] is NULL or not in blk\_mq\_map\_swqueue()
because shared tags can be freed already from another request queue.
The same situation has to be considered during handling CPU online too.
Unmapped hw queue can be remapped after CPU topo is changed, so we need
to allocate tags for the hw queue in blk\_mq\_map\_swqueue(). Then tags
allocation for hw queue can be removed in hctx cpu online notifier, and it
is reasonable to do that after mapping is updated.

Firstly during CPU hotplug, even queue is freezed, timeout
handler still may come and access hctx->tags, which may cause
use after free, so this patch deactivates timeout handler
inside CPU hotplug notifier.
Secondly, tags can be shared by more than one queues, so we
have to check if the hctx has been unmapped, otherwise
still use-after-free on tags can be triggered.

block: destroy bdi before blockdev is unregistered.
commit 6cd18e711dd8075da9d78cfc1239f912ff28968a upstream.
Because of the peculiar way that md devices are created (automatically
when the device node is opened), a new device can be created and
registered immediately after the
blk\_unregister\_region(disk\_devt(disk), disk->minors);
call in del\_gendisk().
Therefore it is important that all visible artifacts of the previous
device are removed before this call. In particular, the 'bdi'.
Since:
commit c4db59d31e39ea067c32163ac961e9c80198fd37
Author: Christoph Hellwig
fs: don't reassign dirty inodes to default\_backing\_dev\_info
moved the
device\_unregister(bdi->dev);
call from bdi\_unregister() to bdi\_destroy() it has been quite easy to
lose a race and have a new (e.g.) "md127" be created after the
blk\_unregister\_region() call and before bdi\_destroy() is ultimately
called by the final 'put\_disk', which must come after del\_gendisk().
The new device finds that the bdi name is already registered in sysfs
and complains
> [ 9627.630029] WARNING: CPU: 18 PID: 3330 at fs/sysfs/dir.c:31 sysfs\_warn\_dup+0x5a/0x70()
> [ 9627.630032] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/virtual/bdi/9:127'
We can fix this by moving the bdi\_destroy() call out of
blk\_release\_queue() (which can happen very late when a refcount
reaches zero) and into blk\_cleanup\_queue() - which happens exactly when the md
device driver calls it.
Then it is only necessary for md to call blk\_cleanup\_queue() before
del\_gendisk(). As loop.c devices are also created on demand by
opening the device node, we make the same change there.

Revert "dm crypt: fix deadlock when async crypto algorithm returns -EBUSY"
commit c0403ec0bb5a8c5b267fb7e16021bec0b17e4964 upstream.
This reverts Linux 4.1-rc1 commit 0618764cb25f6fa9fb31152995de42a8a0496475.
The problem which that commit attempts to fix actually lies in the
Freescale CAAM crypto driver not dm-crypt.
dm-crypt uses CRYPTO\_TFM\_REQ\_MAY\_BACKLOG. This means the the crypto
driver should internally backlog requests which arrive when the queue is
full and process them later. Until the crypto hw's queue becomes full,
the driver returns -EINPROGRESS. When the crypto hw's queue if full,
the driver returns -EBUSY, and if CRYPTO\_TFM\_REQ\_MAY\_BACKLOG is set, is
expected to backlog the request and process it when the hardware has
queue space. At the point when the driver takes the request from the
backlog and starts processing it, it calls the completion function with
a status of -EINPROGRESS. The completion function is called (for a
second time, in the case of backlogged requests) with a status/err of 0
when a request is done.
Crypto drivers for hardware without hardware queueing use the helpers,
crypto\_init\_queue(), crypto\_enqueue\_request(), crypto\_dequeue\_request()
and crypto\_get\_backlog() helpers to implement this behaviour correctly,
while others implement this behaviour without these helpers (ccp, for
example).
dm-crypt (before the patch that needs reverting) uses this API
correctly. It queues up as many requests as the hw queues will allow
(i.e. as long as it gets back -EINPROGRESS from the request function).
Then, when it sees at least one backlogged request (gets -EBUSY), it
waits till that backlogged request is handled (completion gets called
with -EINPROGRESS), and then continues. The references to
af\_alg\_wait\_for\_completion() and af\_alg\_complete() in that commit's
commit message are irrelevant because those functions only handle one
request at a time, unlink dm-crypt.
The problem is that the Freescale CAAM driver, which that commit
describes as having being tested with, fails to implement the
backlogging behaviour correctly. In cam\_jr\_enqueue(), if the hardware
queue is full, it simply returns -EBUSY without backlogging the request.
What the observed deadlock was is not described in the commit message
but it is obviously the wait\_for\_completion() in crypto\_convert() where
dm-crypto would wait for the completion being called with -EINPROGRESS
in the case of backlogged requests. This completion will never be
completed due to the bug in the CAAM driver.
Commit 0618764cb25 incorrectly made dm-crypt wait for every request,
even when the driver/hardware queues are not full, which means that
dm-crypt will never see -EBUSY. This means that that commit will cause
a performance regression on all crypto drivers which implement the API
correctly.
Revert it. Correct backlog handling should be implemented in the CAAM
driver instead.
Cc'ing stable purely because commit 0618764cb25 did. If for some reason
a stable@ kernel did pick up commit 0618764cb25 it should get reverted.

xen/events: Clear cpu\_evtchn\_mask before resuming
commit 5cec98834989a014a9560b1841649eaca95cf00e upstream.
When a guest is resumed, the hypervisor may change event channel
assignments. If this happens and the guest uses 2-level events it
is possible for the interrupt to be claimed by wrong VCPU since
cpu\_evtchn\_mask bits may be stale. This can happen even though
evtchn\_2l\_bind\_to\_cpu() attempts to clear old bits: irq\_info that
is passed in is not necessarily the original one (from pre-migration
times) but instead is freshly allocated during resume and so any
information about which CPU the channel was bound to is lost.
Thus we should clear the mask during resume.
We also need to make sure that bits for xenstore and console channels
are set when these two subsystems are resumed. While rebind\_evtchn\_irq()
(which is invoked for both of them on a resume) calls irq\_set\_affinity(),
the latter will in fact postpone setting affinity until handling the
interrupt. But because cpu\_evtchn\_mask will have bits for these two
cleared we won't be able to take the interrupt.
With that in mind, we need to bind those two channels explicitly in
rebind\_evtchn\_irq(). We will keep irq\_set\_affinity() so that we have a
pass through generic irq affinity code later, in case something needs
to be updated there as well.
(Also replace cpumask\_of(0) with cpumask\_of(info->cpu) in
rebind\_evtchn\_irq(): it should be set to zero in preceding
xen\_irq\_info\_evtchn\_setup().)

vfio: Fix runaway interruptible timeout

Commit 13060b64b819 ("vfio: Add and use device request op for vfio
bus drivers") incorrectly makes use of an interruptible timeout.
When interrupted, the signal remains pending resulting in subsequent
timeouts occurring instantly. This makes the loop spin at a much
higher rate than intended.
Instead of making this completely non-interruptible, we can change
this into a sort of interruptible-once behavior and use the "once"
to log debug information. The driver API doesn't allow us to abort
and return an error code.

the original format support and the OLPC XO-1 laptop showed wrong

The email addresses of the authors of that patch are no longer valid,
so without a way to reach them and ask them about their test setup

writeback: use |1 instead of +1 to protect against div by zero
commit 464d1387acb94dc43ba772b35242345e3d2ead1b upstream.
mm/page-writeback.c has several places where 1 is added to the divisor
to prevent division by zero exceptions; however, if the original
divisor is equivalent to -1, adding 1 leads to division by zero.
There are three places where +1 is used for this purpose - one in
pos\_ratio\_polynom() and two in bdi\_position\_ratio(). The second one
in bdi\_position\_ratio() actually triggered div-by-zero oops on a
machine running a 3.10 kernel. The divisor is
x\_intercept - bdi\_setpoint + 1 == span + 1
span is confirmed to be (u32)-1. It isn't clear how it ended up that
but it could be from write bandwidth calculation underflow fixed by
c72efb658f7c ("writeback: fix possible underflow in write bandwidth
calculation").
At any rate, +1 isn't a proper protection against div-by-zero. This
patch converts all +1 protections to |1. Note that
bdi\_update\_dirty\_ratelimit() was already using |1 before this patch.

mm/memory-failure: call shake\_page() when error hits thp tail page
commit 09789e5de18e4e442870b2d700831f5cb802eb05 upstream.
Currently memory\_failure() calls shake\_page() to sweep pages out from
pcplists only when the victim page is 4kB LRU page or thp head page.
But we should do this for a thp tail page too.
Consider that a memory error hits a thp tail page whose head page is on
a pcplist when memory\_failure() runs. Then, the current kernel skips
shake\_pages() part, so hwpoison\_user\_mappings() returns without calling
split\_huge\_page() nor try\_to\_unmap() because PageLRU of the thp head is
still cleared due to the skip of shake\_page().
As a result, me\_huge\_page() runs for the thp, which is broken behavior.
One effect is a leak of the thp. And another is to fail to isolate the
memory error, so later access to the error address causes another MCE,
which kills the processes which used the thp.
This patch fixes this problem by calling shake\_page() for thp tail case.

gpio: sysfs: fix memory leaks and device hotplug
commit 483d821108791092798f5d230686868112927044 upstream.
Unregister GPIOs requested through sysfs at chip remove to avoid leaking
the associated memory and sysfs entries.
The stale sysfs entries prevented the gpio numbers from being exported
when the gpio range was later reused (e.g. at device reconnect).
This also fixes the related module-reference leak.
Note that kernfs makes sure that any on-going sysfs operations finish
before the class devices are unregistered and that further accesses
fail.
The chip exported flag is used to prevent gpiod exports during removal.
This also makes it harder to trigger, but does not fix, the related race
between gpiochip\_remove and export\_store, which is really a race with
gpiod\_request that needs to be addressed separately.
Also note that this would prevent the crashes (e.g. NULL-dereferences)
at reconnect that affects pre-3.18 kernels, as well as use-after-free on
operations on open attribute files on pre-3.14 kernels (prior to
kernfs).

commit d8fd150fe3935e1692bf57c66691e17409ebb9c1 upstream.
The range check for b-tree level parameter in nilfs\_btree\_root\_broken()
is wrong; it accepts the case of "level == NILFS\_BTREE\_LEVEL\_MAX" even
though the level is limited to values in the range of 0 to
(NILFS\_BTREE\_LEVEL\_MAX - 1).
Since the level parameter is read from storage device and used to index
nilfs\_btree\_path array whose element count is NILFS\_BTREE\_LEVEL\_MAX, it
can cause memory overrun during btree operations if the boundary value
is set to the level parameter on device.
This fixes the broken sanity check and adds a comment to clarify that

commit 489405fe5ed38e65f6f82f131a39c67f3bae6045 upstream.
While setting the time, the RTC TIME register should not be accessed.
However due to hardware constraints, setting the RTC time involves
sleeping during 100ms. This sleep was done outside the critical section
protected by the spinlock, so it was possible to read the RTC TIME
register and get an incorrect value. This patch introduces a mutex for
protecting the RTC TIME access, unlike the spinlock it is allowed to
sleep in a critical section protected by a mutex.
The RTC STATUS register can still be used from the interrupt handler but
it has no effect on setting the time.

"CSC01xx" devices are not added to the PNP bus and hence can not be

x86/PCI/ACPI: Make all resources except [io 0xcf8-0xcff] available on PCI bus
commit 2c62e8492ed7358bbe7da51666c7e0f6da9474ee upstream.
An IO port or MMIO resource assigned to a PCI host bridge may be
consumed by the host bridge itself or available to its child
bus/devices. The ACPI specification defines a bit (Producer/Consumer)
to tell whether the resource is consumed by the host bridge itself,
but firmware hasn't used that bit consistently, so we can't rely on it.
Before commit 593669c2ac0f ("x86/PCI/ACPI: Use common ACPI resource
interfaces to simplify implementation"), arch/x86/pci/acpi.c ignored
all IO port resources defined by acpi\_resource\_io and
acpi\_resource\_fixed\_io to filter out IO ports consumed by the host
bridge itself.
Commit 593669c2ac0f ("x86/PCI/ACPI: Use common ACPI resource interfaces
to simplify implementation") started accepting all IO port and MMIO
resources, which caused a regression that IO port resources consumed
by the host bridge itself became available to its child devices.
Then commit 63f1789ec716 ("x86/PCI/ACPI: Ignore resources consumed by
host bridge itself") ignored resources consumed by the host bridge
itself by checking the IORESOURCE\_WINDOW flag, which accidently removed
MMIO resources defined by acpi\_resource\_memory24, acpi\_resource\_memory32
and acpi\_resource\_fixed\_memory32.
On x86 and IA64 platforms, all IO port and MMIO resources are assumed
to be available to child bus/devices except one special case:
IO port [0xCF8-0xCFF] is consumed by the host bridge itself
to access PCI configuration space.
So explicitly filter out PCI CFG IO ports[0xCF8-0xCFF]. This solution
will also ease the way to consolidate ACPI PCI host bridge common code
from x86, ia64 and ARM64.

x86/spinlocks: Fix regression in spinlock contention detection
commit e8a4a2696fecb398b0288c43c0e0dbb91e265bb2 upstream.
A spinlock is regarded as contended when there is at least one waiter.
Currently, the code that checks whether there are any waiters rely on
tail value being greater than head. However, this is not true if tail
reaches the max value and wraps back to zero, so arch\_spin\_is\_contended()
incorrectly returns 0 (not contended) when tail is smaller than head.
The original code (before regression) handled this case by casting the
(tail - head) to an unsigned value. This change simply restores that
behavior.

# Android Security Bulletin—January 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 03, 2017 | Updated February 2, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of January 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on December 05,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-01-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-01-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the January
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Security vulnerability summary

The tables below contains a list of security vulnerabilities, the Common
Vulnerability and Exposures ID (CVE), the assessed severity, and whether or not
Google devices are affected. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-01-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-01-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the January 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of January 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-01-01](#2017-01-01-details) and
[2017-01-05](#2017-01-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running the
  latest available version of Android are affected by the issue, the table
  will have "None" in the *Updated Google devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs

in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their

privileges. ([CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805))

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's

kvm\_apic\_has\_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](/security/CVE-2015-4692))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter

JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](/security/CVE-2015-4700))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

A double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's path lookup. A

local user could cause a denial of service (Oops). ([CVE-2015-5706](/security/CVE-2015-5706))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-58.97~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-58.97~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-58.97~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-58.97~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

                 CVE-2015-5364 CVE-2015-5366 CVE-2015-5697 CVE-2015-5706
                 CVE-2015-5707

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.

CVE-2015-1333

    Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the
    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

CVE-2015-3212

    Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-4692

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-4700

    Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
    crash the system.

CVE-2015-5364

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.

CVE-2015-5366

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.

CVE-2015-5697

    A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.

CVE-2015-5706

    An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-5707

    An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. CVE-2015-1333, CVE-2015-4692 and
CVE-2015-5706 do not affect the wheezy distribution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except CVE-2015-5364 and CVE-2015-5366
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
