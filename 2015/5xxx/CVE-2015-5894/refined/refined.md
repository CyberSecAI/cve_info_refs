- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The kSecRevocationRequirePositiveResponse flag was specified but not implemented.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A trust evaluation configured to require revocation checking may succeed even if revocation checking fails.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A trust evaluation configured to require revocation checking may succeed even if revocation checking fails
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered when a trust evaluation is configured to require revocation checking.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special capabilities, but the system must be configured to require revocation checking for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
