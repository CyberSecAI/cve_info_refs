The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, but the specific CVE requested, CVE-2015-5851, is included in the provided text.

**CVE-2015-5851**

*   **Root Cause:** An issue existed in the convenience initializer handling within the Multipeer Connectivity framework. This issue allowed encryption to be actively downgraded to a non-encrypted session.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insecure default configuration. The convenience initializer allowed for a downgrade from an encrypted session to an unencrypted one.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker could observe multipeer data transmitted without encryption, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker could leverage the vulnerable API to downgrade an encrypted connection to a non-encrypted connection, allowing them to intercept and view unencrypted data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be local to the system and able to interact with the vulnerable Multipeer Connectivity framework.
