{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Jenkins API tokens of other users were exposed to admins by default. On instances that don't implicitly grant `RunScripts` permission to admins, this allowed admins to run scripts with another user's credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
      "Incorrect Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "In very specific circumstances, allows admins to gain permissions they would not otherwise have, resulting in the ability to execute scripts with another user's credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation through the Jenkins UI or API.",
      "Admin-level access to the Jenkins instance is required."
    ],

      "Attacker must have administrative privileges on the Jenkins instance."
