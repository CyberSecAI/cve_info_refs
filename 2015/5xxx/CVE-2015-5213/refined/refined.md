  "CVE-2015-5213": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the processing of Microsoft Word .doc files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflow."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted Microsoft Word .doc document."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted document.",
        "Additional Details": "The crafted DOC file specifies a document buffer that is too small for the amount of data provided for it. Failure to detect the discrepancy leads to the vulnerability."
  }
}
