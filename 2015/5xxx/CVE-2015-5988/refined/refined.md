Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-5988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Belkin N600 DB Wireless Dual Band N+ router, by default, does not set a password for its web management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of mandatory authentication for the web management interface.
- **Credentials Management:**  Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the lack of proper credentials management (CWE-255).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** A local area network (LAN) attacker can gain privileged access to the web management interface.
- **Remote Attacks (CSRF):** The lack of default credentials can be leveraged in remote attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), where an attacker can establish a session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **LAN-based Attack:**  Attackers on the local network can directly access the web management interface.
- **Remote (CSRF):** Remote attackers can exploit the lack of default credentials in CSRF attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **LAN Access:** A LAN-based attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
- **No Authentication Required:** An attacker does not need valid credentials to access the web management interface in the default configuration
- **CSRF Scenario:** For remote attacks, the attacker would need to induce a user to visit a malicious website or click a malicious link, enabling a CSRF attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The document states that even though firmware updates have been released, CVE-2015-5988 is still not addressed since there is still no password requirement or prompt for users to create a password.
- The vendor suggests the use of strong passwords as a general good security practice, even though this doesn't fully protect against LAN attackers.
