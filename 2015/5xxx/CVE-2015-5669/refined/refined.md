Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in Enisys Gw, an open-source groupware. Specifically, the lack of proper validation allows for the creation of arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of input data, which an attacker can manipulate to create files at arbitrary locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** A logged-in attacker can create files at locations they choose.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The created files can be manipulated to enable the execution of arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be logged into the Enisys Gw system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected Enisys Gw system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running Enisys Gw.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-5669 is a vulnerability in Enisys Gw that allows authenticated remote attackers to create arbitrary files, and potentially execute arbitrary code due to a lack of proper input validation. The attacker must have network access and be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
