- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation of the file type or path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload, directory traversal
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g. PHP scripts) through the application's upload functionality using directory traversal in the `specid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Thomson Reuters FATCA application.
