Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an issue in how the affected TYPE-MOON games load save data. Specifically, the games are vulnerable to OS command injection when loading specially crafted save data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The games fail to properly sanitize or validate data within save files, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the system where the vulnerable game is running. This could potentially lead to:
    - Confidentiality breach (access to sensitive data)
    - Integrity violation (modification of system files)
    - Availability compromise (reduced performance, interruptions).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (L).
- The attacker provides a malicious save file to the victim. The victim must then load this malicious save file into the game.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious save data file.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to load the malicious save data into one of the vulnerable games. This could be accomplished through social engineering or by hosting the malicious save file on a website for download.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**
The provided CVSS base score is 6.8 (Medium). The metrics are:
- Access Vector: Local (L)
- Access Complexity: High (H)
- Authentication: None (N)
- Confidentiality Impact: Partial (P)
- Integrity Impact: Partial (P)
- Availability Impact: Partial (P)

**Affected Products:**
- Fate/stay night (CD, DVD)
- Fate/hollow ataraxia
- Witch on the Holy Night
- Fate/stay night + hollow ataraxia set
