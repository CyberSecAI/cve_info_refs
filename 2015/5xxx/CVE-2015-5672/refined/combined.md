# JVN#80144272 Multiple TYPE-MOON games vulnerable to OS command injection

## Overview

Multiple games provided by TYPE-MOON contain an OS command injection vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* Fate/stay night (CD, DVD)
* Fate/hollow ataraxia
* Witch on the Holy Night
* Fate/stay night + hollow ataraxia set

## Description

Multiple games provided by TYPE-MOON contain an OS command injection vulnerability ([CWE-78](//cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)) due to an issue in loading save data.

## Impact

When specially crafted save data is loaded, an arbitrary OS command may be executed.

## Solution

**Apply a Workaround**

The following workaround can mitigate the affects of this vulnerability.

* Do not load save data provided by an untrusted source.

**Analyzed on 2015.11.05 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:6.8

## Comment

This analysis assumes that the user is tricked into loading malicious save data.
