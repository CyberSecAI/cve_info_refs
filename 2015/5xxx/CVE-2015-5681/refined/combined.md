Title: Remote file upload vulnerability & SQLi in wordpress plugin wp-powerplaygallery v3.3
Author: Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0
Date: 2015-06-27
Download Site: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-powerplaygallery>
Vendor: WP SlideShow
Vendor Notified: 2015-06-29
Advisory: <http://www.vapid.dhs.org/advisory.php?v=132>
Vendor Contact: plugins () wordpress org
Description: This is the best gallery for touch screens. It is fully touch enabled with great features. This gallery is
compatible wiht iphone and ipads. It is also allow us to use it as a widget.You can also enable this Powerplay Gallery
on your wordpress site by placing code snippet in your template (.php) files. It shows flash gallery for desktops and
touch enabled version for ipad and iphones.
Vulnerability:
1. Ability to create directories out side of the upload path by using ../:
Lines 56-59 of upload.php:

56 // Create target dir
57 if (!file_exists($targetDir)) {
58         @mkdir($targetDir);
59 }

2. Arbitrary file uploads to a path in the web root directory:
Lines 138-160 of uploads.php don’t verify what types of files are allowed or where they should be placed:

138 // Open temp file
139 if (!$out = @fopen("{$filePath}.part", $chunks ? "ab" : "wb")) {
140         die('{"jsonrpc" : "2.0", "error" : {"code": 102, "message": "Failed to open output stream."}, "id" :
"id"}');
141 }
142
143 if (!empty($_FILES)) {
144         if ($_FILES["file"]["error"] || !is_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"])) {
145                 die('{"jsonrpc" : "2.0", "error" : {"code": 103, "message": "Failed to move uploaded file."}    ,
"id" : "id"}');
146         }
147
148         // Read binary input stream and append it to temp file
149         if (!$in = @fopen($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], "rb")) {
150                 die('{"jsonrpc" : "2.0", "error" : {"code": 101, "message": "Failed to open input stream."},
"id" : "id"}');
151         }
152 } else {
153         if (!$in = @fopen("php://input", "rb")) {
154                 die('{"jsonrpc" : "2.0", "error" : {"code": 101, "message": "Failed to open input stream."},
"id" : "id"}');
155         }
156 }
157
158 while ($buff = fread($in, 4096)) {
159         fwrite($out, $buff);
160 }

3. Sql injection
Lines 131-135 of upload.php fail to handle user input appropriately either by sanitizing or paramaterizing it.
Injection points are
any GET/POST to albumid or name.

131 $query = "INSERT INTO ".$wpdb->prefix."pp_images (`category_id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `thumb`, `
image`, `status`, `order`, `creation_date` )
132           VALUES (".$_REQUEST['albumid'].",'".$imgname[0]."','".$imgname[0]."','','".$resize."','".$_REQUEST
['name']."',1,'','NULL')";
133
134           $wpdb->query($query);
135

This seems to be one of several cases where a third party has taken
example code from the Ephox (formerly Moxiecode) Plupload product and
added undesirable new behavior.

For background,
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moxiecode/plupload/master/examples/upload.php>
is the current upstream code. Although this upstream code could
introduce security problems in some contexts, the code is not assigned
any CVE IDs because it is clearly marked as an example, and would not
be installed on a web server as a normal part of installing Plupload:

  #!! IMPORTANT:
  #!! this file is just an example, it doesn't incorporate any security checks and
  #!! is not recommended to be used in production environment as it is. Be sure to
  #!! revise it and customize to your needs.

The code reported here is from
<http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-powerplaygallery/trunk/upload.php>
instead. All of the specific reported issues are ones that exist in
wp-powerplaygallery and don't exist in Plupload.

The most obvious difference is that the "INSERT INTO" is a new code
block in wp-powerplaygallery - the upstream code doesn't use SQL at
all.

Use CVE-2015-5599.

> 1. Ability to create directories out side of the upload path by using ../:

As far as we can tell, the issue you are reporting (when a current PHP
version is used) is that the attacker can create a directory anywhere
with "_uploadfolder" at the end of its name. This behavior isn't
required for achieving PHP code execution, and seems unlikely to help
with other important attacks. It might waste disk space on a small
filesystem, and might allow an attacker to store files outside of
wp-content (e.g., in a directory that wouldn't be checked during a
user's post-exploitation cleanup). If so, then this is an issue that
can be included in CVE, but it seems marginal.

For anyone who is interested in reporting these types of low-priority
side issues: it would be helpful to explicitly state that the issue is
independently relevant and could be independently fixed.

> 2. Arbitrary file uploads to a path in the web root directory:
> Lines 138-160 of uploads.php don't verify what types of files are allowed or where they should be placed:

We didn't completely understand this part. It seems that the essence
of the problem is that the product could reject unsafe file types such
as .php files, but doesn't do that. That can have one CVE ID. Is there
also a problem with "where they should be placed" within this part of
the code? The files seem to be placed in a *_uploadfolder/big/
directory, which is a correct directory for an upload of an image
file.

Are you also reporting any authorization problem? Is upload.php
responsible for verifying that the client user has the upload_files
capability, regardless of what file type is being uploaded?

> albumid needs to be a numeric value matching an existing album number, 1 is probably a good start
> but you can enumerate these by using curl, and looking for redirect 301 responses:

Why does the album number need to exist? Wasn't the mkdir supposed to
create the directory for an arbitrary $_REQUEST['albumid'] value?

Use CVE-2015-5681 for the issue in which an executable file is not
blocked, and consequently an attacker has the ability to create and
execute arbitrary PHP code, such as at the
/wp-content/uploads/power_play/4_uploadfolder/big/shell.php URI in
your original example.

Thanks for this additional information. In that case, we feel that it
is best to categorize the:

  // Create target dir
  if (!file_exists($targetDir)) {
          @mkdir($targetDir);
  }

code block as, more or less, an authorization bypass. The user of
upload.php has no legitimate need to create a $targetDir directory,
because this directory is usable only if previously created by a
power_play.php code block of:

        if( !is_dir( $album_dir ) )
                mkdir($album_dir);
        if( !is_dir($album_dir . '/big') )
                mkdir($album_dir . '/big');
        if( !is_dir($album_dir . '/thumb') )
                mkdir($album_dir . '/thumb');

The user of upload.php can choose to use directory traversal (as you
mentioned) or can simply create a huge number of directories with (for
example) numeric or alphanumeric $_REQUEST['albumid'] values.
Directory traversal is not an independent primary vulnerability and
cannot have its own separate CVE ID.

Use CVE-2015-5682 for the issue of a superfluous "@mkdir($targetDir);"
line that allows attackers to create arbitrarily many useless
directories via a series of requests.

>> Are you also reporting any authorization problem? Is upload.php
>> responsible for verifying that the client user has the upload_files
>> capability, regardless of what file type is being uploaded?

> I know I wouldn't want arbitrary images uploaded to my Wordpress

This was a somewhat philosophical question about WordPress security.
There are no more CVE ID assignments below, but here are our comments
in case anyone is interested.

As far as we can tell, there is no expectation that the author of a
plugin must determine whether the plugin offers a feature associated
with the concept of "uploading files" and, if so, make that feature
available only to users who have the upload_files capability. In some
cases, this would be a good idea for aligning the plugin's behavior
with user expectations, or for making the plugin's authorization model
easy to understand. However, a plugin may have a good reason to do
something entirely different. For example, if there are many people
who need to do exactly one upload and will never interact with that
WordPress installation again, it might be simpler to have an upload
password.

WordPress apparently supports the behavior of some plugins with:

  wp-admin/media-new.php

  /**
   * Manage media uploaded file.
   *
   * There are many filters in here for media. Plugins can extend functionality
   * by hooking into the filters.
  ...
   if (!current_user_can('upload_files'))
           wp_die(__('You do not have permission to upload files.'));

The current case is, essentially, that an unauthenticated attacker can
send a request to upload.php and place non-executable content at the
URI:

  /wp-content/uploads/power_play/4_uploadfolder/big/not-a-shell.jpg

Your comment was "I know I wouldn't want arbitrary images uploaded,"
which doesn't directly answer the question of whether this is a
reported vulnerability or not. Our current feeling is that we will not
universally categorize this as a vulnerability unless there is
confirming feedback from the author. We didn't find anything at
either:

  [https://web.archive.org/web/20150503133237/https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-powerplaygallery/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150503133237/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-powerplaygallery/)
  <http://wpslideshow.com/powerplay-gallery/>

documenting that the upload process should be authenticated or that
uploaded files should be initially inaccessible. There are obviously
very good reasons to prevent an unauthenticated upload of a JPG file
to an accessible and predictable URL; however, there might sometimes
be a tradeoff with usability and the WordPress installation might want
to deploy the plugin anyway until abuse is actually observed. We also
realize that, for any specific example in which this is occurring,
there is probably a possible design improvement that preserves nearly
all usability and makes abuse much more difficult. Still, our decision
for now is that there's no CVE ID associated with creating
/wp-content/uploads/power_play/4_uploadfolder/big/not-a-shell.jpg in
the above example.
