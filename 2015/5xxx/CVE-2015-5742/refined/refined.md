Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5742:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Veeam Backup & Replication (B&R) versions 6.x, 7.x, and 8.0 stored credentials used by the VeeamVixProxy component. Specifically, the password for the account used to run Veeam components was stored in log files in a double-base64 encoded format. These log files were, by default, accessible to any local user on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data (the Veeam component's password) in log files.
2.  **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords were stored in an easily reversible format (double-base64 encoding).
3.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The log files containing the encoded credentials were world-readable by default. This violates the principle of least privilege.
4. **Lack of Log Rotation**: In versions prior to 8, a bug prevented log rotation, meaning older systems could have a large amount of logs with extensive credential history.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user, even with low privileges, could access the log files, decode the password, and use it to gain elevated privileges (Local Administrator or Domain Administrator), depending on the account used by the Veeam service.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With the extracted credentials, an attacker could use them via RDP or RPC (e.g., psexec) to gain control of the system.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised account was a domain administrator, it could enable lateral movement to other systems on the domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the Windows system where Veeam B&R was installed. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting another vulnerability, social engineering, or physical access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker only requires a local user account on the affected system. No special privileges are initially required.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to read files from the file system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by ISGroup during a penetration test.
*   Veeam assigned it internal case #00984117.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Veeam B&R 8.0 Update 3 and 9.x.
*   A workaround was suggested, involving changing the access permissions on the log directories to only allow Administrators to read them, as well as deleting the log files via a scheduled task.
*   The affected component is VeeamVixProxy.
*   The log files are located at `%allusersprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup` for Windows Server 2003 and `%programdata%\Veeam\Backup\` for Windows Server 2008 and later.
