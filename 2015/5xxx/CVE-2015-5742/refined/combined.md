#### Oops! Something went wrong.

Please, try again later.

## Challenge

The vulnerability allows any local Windows user with low privileges, such as the ones provided to an anonymous IIS's virtualhost user, to access Veeam Backup logfiles and extract the password, used to run Veeam components, which is stored as a doublebase64 encoded string.

## Cause

The affected component is VeeamVixProxy, created by default on installation and configured to run with a privileged Local Administrator or a Domain Administrator account.

Using such accounts is correct and required for the components to run properly, as stated by the userguide and wizard prompts for adding a VMware or HyperV Backup Proxies:

***"Type in an account with local administrator privileges

on the server you are adding. Use DOMAIN\USER format for domain

accounts, or HOST\USER for local accounts."***

We conservatively refer to this issue as a Local Administrator Privilege Escalation but the use of Domain Administrator accounts for Veeam is not discouraged, if not advised, and this is a common pattern in production.

## Solution

Update Veeam Backup & Replication to version [8.0 Update 3](https://www.veeam.com/kb2068) or [9.x](https://www.veeam.com/kb2147).

**Workaround for operating systems on your virtual machines:**

If Veeam B&R is installed on a Windows 2003 environment, change the access permissions on ***%alluserprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup*** and subdirectories, so that only members of the "Administrators" group can read it.

If Veeam B&R is installed on Windows 2008 and newer, change the access permissions on ***%programdata%\Veeam\Backup\*** and subdirectories, so that only members of the "Administrators" group can read it.

like Veeam Availability Suite and Veeam One.

ISGroup is an Italian Information Security boutique, we found this
0day issue while performing a Penetration Test for a customer, you
can discover more about ISGroup by visiting <http://www.isgroup.biz/>.

Responsible disclosure with Veeam: Veeam has no public security@ contact
and we worked with them through the ticket system opening a case using
one of our customer's assistance contract. We were unable to escape
from the sternness of this type of communication and move to PGP emails.

Their response anyway was pretty prompt, we spoke first with Denis
Bodnar and then escalate to Fred Bozhanov, Veeam Support Management. He
managed communication with the developers. We advise Veeam to give some
of their senior developers a "security team" mandate and to expose such
team to external, direct, communication. The people we spoke to did
their best and were extremely kind but they must be supported by a
corporate process.

Prior vulnerabilities in Veeam: It's very difficult to say if Veeam had
previous vulnerabilities, there are no CVE assigned to this vendor both
on Nist and to it's CPE (cpe:/:veeam). Information to customers of the
vulnerability is shown in the "other" section of the changelog: "Removed
weakly encrypted username and password logging from guest processing
components using networkless (VIX) guest interaction mode. Veeam thanks
Pasquale Fiorillo and Francesco Ongaro of ISGroup for vulnerability
discovery.".

The latest version of the software at the time of writing can be

II. DESCRIPTION

The vulnerability allows a local Windows user, even with low privileges
as the ones provided to an anonymous IIS's virtualhost user, to access
Veeam Backup logfiles that include a double-base64 encoded version of
the password used by Veeam to run.

The affected component is VeeamVixProxy, created by default on
installation and the user must be a privileged Local Administrator or
a Domain Administrator.

For example the wizard for adding a VMware or Hyper-V Backup Proxy
explicitly state "Type in an account with local administrator privileges
on the server you are adding. Use DOMAIN\USER format for domain
accounts, or HOST\USER for local accounts.".

We conservatively refer to this issue as a Local Administrator Privilege
Escalation but the use of Domain Administrator accounts is not
discouraged, if not advised, and we saw this pattern in our customerâ€™s
production infrastructures.

TLDR: Anything able to read VeeamVixProxy logfiles, world readable by
default, can escalate to Local or Domain Administrator.

III. ANALYSIS

Veeam Backup & Replication (B&R) v6, v6.5, v7, v8 store VeeamVixProxy
logfiles in a directory accessible by Everyone and with permissions
that make them readable by Everyone (Everyone is, in the Microsoft
Windows terminology, the equivalent of the Unixâ€™s nobody user).

Such logs, that are continuously generated, contain a Local or Domain
Administration user and password in an easily reversible (obfuscated)
format.

In versions of Veeam prior to 8 a bug prevented log rotation [3,4], on
older systems there could be a large amount of logs and thus an
extensive history of past and current Local or Domain Administrator
credentials.

A) Logfiles readable by Everyone

  As shown in <http://www.veeam.com/kb1789> the default log path is

  Windows Server 2003: %allusersprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup
  Windows Server 2008 and up: %programdata%\Veeam\Backup

  Our evidence is for Windows Server 2003, access to the needed files
  are guaranteed to the Windows group "Everyone" so any local user, even
  the ones used to map IIS sites, can access them.

  This pose all the information contained in the logfiles at risk and
  is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>

B) Double encoded password in Logfiles

  The install/execution username and password is stored double-base64
  encoded in Veeam Backup "VeeamVixProxy" logfiles.

  Such files exists in "Veeam\Backup" with a name scheme as follows:

  VeeamVixProxy_%dd%mm%yyyy.log

  eg: VeeamVixProxy_16072015.log

  The password is present in multiple points of the log-file and the
  files are generated contentiously.

  In this scenario, a Local File Read vulnerability could lead to full
  system compromise given the fact that an attacker can re-use such
  credentials by RDP or RPC (eg: psexec).

  The log format leaking the credentials is:

  <date> <time> <number> Blob Data: <base64>

  eg: 01/07/2015 1.33.42 3936 Blob Data:
  IwAAAAoAAABWAGUAZQBhAG0AVQBzAGUAcgAQAAAAVQAyAFYAagBjAG0AVgAwAA

  The "<base64>" of interest has the following format:

  echo 'IwAAAAoAAABWAGUAZQBhAG0AVQBzAGUAcgAQAAAAVQAyAFYAagBjAG0AVgAwAA'\
  | base64 -d | hexdump -C
  00000000  23 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00  56 00 65 00 65 00 61 00
|#.......V.e.e.a.|
  00000010  6d 00 55 00 73 00 65 00  72 00 10 00 00 00 55 00
|m.U.s.e.r.....U.|
  00000020  32 00 56 00 6a 00 63 00  6d 00 56 00 30 00
|2.V.j.c.m.V.0.  |

  First byte is \x23 (#), followed by a NULL and a newline (\x0a),
  followed by a NULL. Next bytes specify the username, followed by
  a DLE (data link escape) and a NULL. Everything in the first base64
  container is in UTF16.

  echo -n "isgroup" | iconv -t UTF-16LE | hexdump -C

  What follows is the most interesting part, a base64 representation of
  the password.

  echo -en "U2VjcmV0" | base64 -d
  Secret

  Since the VeeamVixProxy files are continuously written the leak will
  occur even if administrators delete them. An official fix from Veeam
  is needed in order to fully resolve the vulnerability.

  This vulnerability is especially dangerous when the "VeeamAdmin"
  (or whenever you called it) is also a Domain Administration user.

IV. WORKAROUND

Update: on 8 October 2015 Veeam B&R 8.0 Update 3 has been released and
the vendor states it fixes the vulnerability. You are strongly advised
to update to the latest version. We did not investigate but will update
you on ush.it if needed.

Follow this steps to mitigate the issue meanwhile an official patch
is released:

If you are on Windows 2003 environment fix the permission on
"%alluserprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup" path so that only
"Administrators" group can read it.

If you are on Windows 2008 environment fix the permission on
"%programdata%\Veeam\Backup\" so that only "Administrators" group can
read it.

Create a scheduled task to delete this logfiles from disk.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Vendor released Update 3 of Veeam B&R 8.0 that contains the proper
security patch. At the time of this writing an official patch is
currently available.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

Mitre assigned the CVE-2015-5742 for this vulnerability, internally to
Veeam it's referred as Case #00984117.

Pasquale "sid" Fiorillo found a critical vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication version 6, 7 and 8. At the time of writing this impact a very large of updated and outdated/legacy Veeam deployments. The vulnerability allows a local unprivileged user of a Windows guest to gain Local and/or Domain Administrator access when VeeamVixProxy is active, the de-facto default in VMWare and Hyper-V environments.

I. BACKGROUND

Veeam Software provides backup, disaster recovery and virtualization
management software for the VMware and Hyper-V environments. In 2012
Veeam gained more than 1200 employees worldwide, from 10 employees in
2008. It has more than 157'000 customers, 33'000 partners and 80 top
industry awards and claims to be the "#1 VM Backup" solution after it
gained traction against competitors like Backup Exec and Tivoli Storage
Manager.

Veeam Backup & Replication is the foundation of many Veeam products,
like Veeam Availability Suite and Veeam One.

ISGroup is an Italian Information Security boutique, we found this
0day issue while performing a Penetration Test for a customer, you
can discover more about ISGroup by visiting http://www.isgroup.biz/.

Responsible disclosure with Veeam: Veeam has no public security@ contact

II. DESCRIPTION

The vulnerability allows a local Windows user, even with low privileges
as the ones provided to an anonymous IIS's virtualhost user, to access
Veeam Backup logfiles that include a double-base64 encoded version of
the password used by Veeam to run.

The affected component is VeeamVixProxy, created by default on

TLDR: Anything able to read VeeamVixProxy logfiles, world readable by

III. ANALYSIS

Veeam Backup & Replication (B&R) v6, v6.5, v7, v8 store VeeamVixProxy
logfiles in a directory accessible by Everyone and with permissions
that make them readable by Everyone (Everyone is, in the Microsoft
Windows terminology, the equivalent of the Unixâ€™s nobody user).

Such logs, that are continuously generated, contain a Local or Domain
Administration user and password in an easily reversible (obfuscated)
format.

In versions of Veeam prior to 8 a bug prevented log rotation [3,4], on
older systems there could be a large amount of logs and thus an
extensive history of past and current Local or Domain Administrator
credentials.

A) Logfiles readable by Everyone

  As shown in http://www.veeam.com/kb1789 the default log path is

  Windows Server 2003: %allusersprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup
  Windows Server 2008 and up: %programdata%\Veeam\Backup

  Our evidence is for Windows Server 2003, access to the needed files
  are guaranteed to the Windows group "Everyone" so any local user, even
  the ones used to map IIS sites, can access them.

  This pose all the information contained in the logfiles at risk and
  is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

B) Double encoded password in Logfiles

  The install/execution username and password is stored double-base64
  encoded in Veeam Backup "VeeamVixProxy" logfiles.

  Such files exists in "Veeam\Backup" with a name scheme as follows:

  VeeamVixProxy_%dd%mm%yyyy.log

  eg: VeeamVixProxy_16072015.log

  The password is present in multiple points of the log-file and the
  files are generated contentiously.

  In this scenario, a Local File Read vulnerability could lead to full
  system compromise given the fact that an attacker can re-use such
  credentials by RDP or RPC (eg: psexec).

  The log format leaking the credentials is:

  <date> <time> <number> Blob Data: <base64>

  eg: 01/07/2015 1.33.42 3936 Blob Data:
  IwAAAAoAAABWAGUAZQBhAG0AVQBzAGUAcgAQAAAAVQAyAFYAagBjAG0AVgAwAA

  The "<base64>" of interest has the following format:

  echo 'IwAAAAoAAABWAGUAZQBhAG0AVQBzAGUAcgAQAAAAVQAyAFYAagBjAG0AVgAwAA'\
  | base64 -d | hexdump -C
  00000000  23 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00  56 00 65 00 65 00 61 00 |#.......V.e.e.a.|
  00000010  6d 00 55 00 73 00 65 00  72 00 10 00 00 00 55 00 |m.U.s.e.r.....U.|
  00000020  32 00 56 00 6a 00 63 00  6d 00 56 00 30 00       |2.V.j.c.m.V.0.  |

  First byte is \x23 (#), followed by a NULL and a newline (\x0a),
  followed by a NULL. Next bytes specify the username, followed by
  a DLE (data link escape) and a NULL. Everything in the first base64
  container is in UTF16.

  echo -n "isgroup" | iconv -t UTF-16LE | hexdump -C

  What follows is the most interesting part, a base64 representation of
  the password.

  echo -en "U2VjcmV0" | base64 -d
  Secret

  Since the VeeamVixProxy files are continuously written the leak will
  occur even if administrators delete them. An official fix from Veeam
  is needed in order to fully resolve the vulnerability.

  This vulnerability is especially dangerous when the "VeeamAdmin"
  (or whenever you called it) is also a Domain Administration user.

IV. WORKAROUND

Update: on 8 October 2015 Veeam B&R 8.0 Update 3 has been released and
the vendor states it fixes the vulnerability. You are strongly advised
to update to the latest version. We did not investigate but will update
you on ush.it if needed.

Follow this steps to mitigate the issue meanwhile an official patch
is released:

If you are on Windows 2003 environment fix the permission on
"%alluserprofile%\Application Data\Veeam\Backup" path so that only
"Administrators" group can read it.

If you are on Windows 2008 environment fix the permission on
"%programdata%\Veeam\Backup\" so that only "Administrators" group can
read it.

Create a scheduled task to delete this logfiles from disk.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Vendor released Update 3 of Veeam B&R 8.0 that contains the proper
security patch. At the time of this writing an official patch is
currently available.

## Challenge

Release Notes for Veeam Backup & Replication 8.0 Update 3

## Cause

Please confirm you are running version 8.0.0.807, 8.0.0.817, 8.0.0.831, 8.0.0.917, 8.0.0.2018, 8.0.0.2021, 8.0.0.2029 or 8.0.0.2030 prior to installing this update. You can check this under Help | About in Veeam Backup & Replication console. After upgrading, your build will be version 8.0.0.2084

Prior to installing this update please reboot the Veeam server to clear any locks on the Veeam services and when the reboot is done, please stop all the Veeam services before applying the update.

**After installing the update, during the first start of the Veeam Backup Service, required modifications will be made to the configuration database automatically to optimize its performance. These modifications may take up to 10 minutes to complete. Please do not reboot the Veeam server, or attempt to stop the service during this operation. If there is concern regarding the time that the Veeam Backup Service takes to start after upgrade, please contact Veeam Customer Support.**

Once Veeam Backup Service starts, please open the console and allow Veeam Backup & Replication to update its remote components.

## Solution

New Features and Enhancements

**Microsoft**

* Support for Windows 10 as guest virtual machines (VMs), including application-aware processing.
* Support for installation of Veeam Backup & Replication and all of its components on Windows 10.

**VMware**

* Support for vSphere 6.0 Update 1.
* Added ability to convert "VMware Tools not found" job warning to informational event. To enable this behavior, set *DisableVMwareToolsNotFoundWarning* (REG\_DWORD) registry value to 1.

**Linux**

* Support for the following additional SSH ciphers: aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, aes192-cbc and aes256-cbc.

**Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SQL Server**

* Log truncation is automatically skipped for stopped and unsupported SQL Server instances to prevent errors from being logged.
* Preferred network settings will now also apply to transaction log backup jobs.
* Support for SQL Servers using non-standard port number.

**Veeam Explorer for SharePoint**

* Support for ADFS authentication.
* Support for UPN credentials.

**SureBackup**

* Proxy appliance will now respond to ping from within Virtual Lab to prevent firewalls automatically blocking its network as public.

**Other**

* Removed weakly encrypted username and password logging from guest processing components using networkless (VIX) guest interaction mode. Veeam thanks Pasquale Fiorillo and Francesco Ongaro of [ISGroup](http://www.isgroup.it) for vulnerability discovery.
* Improved performance of certain user interface operations, such as opening Backups node in large environments.
* Reduced load on SQL Server hosting product configuration database, while improving SQL interaction reliability in large environments.
* Improved performance of configuration backup in large environments.
* Minor enhancements and bug fixes in various product areas.

## More Information

Due to an update and internal change in behavior of CTP driver on Hyper-V hosts, each first run of each job after the update will perform a full scan of disks on the source side, which may extend backup times significantly. It is recommended to plan accordingly prior to installing the update.

Note: This version has not been tested against with vSphere builds beyond 6.0 Update 1. If you are using a later vSphere version, please upgrade to Veeam Backup & Replication 9.0
