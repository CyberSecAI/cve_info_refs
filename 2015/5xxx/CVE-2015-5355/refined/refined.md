Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to CVE-2015-5355:

**Vulnerability:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The GetSimpleCMS version 3.3.5 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing pages. Specifically, the page header and body fields allow the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided data when saving page content, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database, and executed whenever a user views the affected page, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that gets executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected pages.
*   **Account Takeover:** A successful XSS injection can be used to steal user session cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access or account takeover.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate data displayed on the page, redirect users, or perform other actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Page Creation/Editing:** An attacker, with the ability to create or edit pages within the GetSimpleCMS system, can insert a malicious payload in the header or body fields of the page.
*   **User Browsing:** When a user browses the page containing the malicious script, the script will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GetSimpleCMS system, with the privilege to create or edit pages.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided exploit payload is: `">img src="blah.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')"/` . The issue report specifies to add a `<` before the `img` and a `>` after the final `/`, making it: `<img src="blah.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')">`

**Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in GetSimpleCMS version 3.3.6.

**Additional Notes:**
* The github content confirms that this XSS vulnerability is associated with the fix in version 3.3.6.
*   The provided content mentions multiple security fixes in the 3.3.6 release, including several related to file uploads, JavaScript injection and directory traversal.  While these are also security issues, they are separate from this particular XSS.
