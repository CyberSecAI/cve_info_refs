      "vulnerability": "The content describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Tidy, triggered by specific HTML input. The vulnerability occurs in the `tmbstrndup` function, which allocates memory with `TidyAlloc` but may receive a zero-length parameter, leading to a zero-byte allocation, subsequently causing a buffer overflow when copying the string data using a loop with a large length due to an incorrect decrement. It also mentions another variant of the vulnerability that could lead to allocation of a 4GB buffer causing a denial-of-service. This second variant is what is assigned CVE-2015-5523",

This is the original report that lead to both CVE-2015-5522 and CVE-2015-5523.
