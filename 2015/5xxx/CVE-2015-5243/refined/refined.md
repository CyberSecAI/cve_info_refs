  "CVE-2015-5243": {
    "description": "The phpWhois library is vulnerable to remote code execution due to insufficient sanitization of WHOIS data, specifically in the `generic_parser_b` function within `whois.parser.php`. This function uses `eval` to process WHOIS data, leading to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker controlling the WHOIS information of a domain can execute arbitrary PHP code within the context of the application.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The library uses the `eval` function on untrusted WHOIS data without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `generic_parser_b` function constructs PHP statements by concatenating strings from WHOIS records and then passes this to `eval`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of `eval` with unsanitized input",
        "Insufficient input sanitization",
        "Code injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution leading to full compromise of the application, access to sensitive data, and the ability to pivot to internal networks.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious WHOIS record data",
        "Specifically crafted domain registration information",
         "The attack is limited to certain Top Level Domains (TLDs) that use the vulnerable parser."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the WHOIS record data of a domain that is looked up by a vulnerable application. This involves registering a domain and setting the WHOIS record data to include malicious code. Specifically, the attacker needs to start a whois line with a backslash and a double quote (\")."
    },
    "additional_details": {
        "affected_versions": "Versions of phpWhois prior to 5.1.0 are affected. This includes the original phpWhois on Sourceforge and forks on GitHub such as those by abcdmitry, jsmitty12 and webalternative.",
        "fixed_versions": "The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1.0 of jsmitty12's fork of the library.",
        "poc": "A proof-of-concept exploit involves registering a domain and setting a malicious WHOIS record, which when parsed by the vulnerable application, executes arbitrary PHP commands on the server.",
         "timeline": "The vulnerability was identified on 2015-08-25 and publicly disclosed on 2015-12-02. A fix was released in the Sourceforge project on 2015-09-09. jsmitty12 released a fixed version on 2018-05-29."
