  "cveId": "CVE-2015-5319",
  "date": "2015-11-11",
  "description": "When creating a job using the create-job CLI command, external entities are not discarded (nor processed). If these job configurations are processed by another user with an XML-aware tool (e.g. using get-job/update-job), information from that userâ€™s computer may be disclosed to Jenkins and the attacker.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The Jenkins CLI `create-job` command does not discard or process external entities in job configurations, leading to XXE vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XXE (XML External Entity) Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure from a user's computer to the Jenkins server and the attacker if a job configuration with external entities is processed by another user with an XML-aware tool (e.g., `get-job/update-job`).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Attacker creates a malicious job configuration using the `create-job` CLI command, embedding external entities.",
      "A different user then processes the malicious job configuration using an XML-aware tool (e.g., `get-job/update-job`), triggering the XXE vulnerability."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to use the Jenkins CLI `create-job` command to create job configurations and must convince another user to process the malicious configuration using an XML aware tool.",
    "references": [
        "https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2015-11-11",
        "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5319"
    ],
  "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability requires a high degree of specific user interaction. The kind of information disclosed is limited, therefore its severity is considered low."
