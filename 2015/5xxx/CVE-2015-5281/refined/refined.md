Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `grub2` bootloader for EFI systems included modules (multiboot and multiboot2) that, while intended for other purposes, could be misused in EFI environments. These modules lacked the necessary checks to prevent them from being loaded in Secure Boot environments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Bypass Secure Boot:** The vulnerable modules could load arbitrary, non-verified code, effectively circumventing the Secure Boot mechanism.
- **Unrestricted Module Loading:** The `multiboot` and `multiboot2` modules were not properly restricted in EFI environments, allowing them to be used to load malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Circumvented Secure Boot:** Attackers could bypass Secure Boot's protection of the boot process, enabling the loading of malicious code.
- **Boot-time Rootkits:** Attackers could introduce boot-time rootkits, gaining control of the system before the operating system loads.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker can load and execute arbitrary code at boot time.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Boot Menu (No Password):** If the `grub2` boot menu was not password-protected, an attacker could directly manipulate it to load malicious modules.
- **`grub2` Configuration File (Root Privileges):** An attacker with root privileges could modify the `grub2` configuration file to load malicious modules at boot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access or Root Privileges:** The attacker requires either physical access to the system to manipulate the boot menu or root privileges to modify the `grub2` configuration file.
- **Knowledge of `grub2` and Multiboot Modules:** The attacker needs to understand how `grub2` and multiboot modules work to craft malicious modules and configure the boot process to load them.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affected `grub2` builds for EFI systems.
- The provided content also mentions several bug fixes included in the same update, which are not related to the CVE-2015-5281 vulnerability.
- The issue is addressed in RHSA-2015:2401.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 2.6 (Low).
