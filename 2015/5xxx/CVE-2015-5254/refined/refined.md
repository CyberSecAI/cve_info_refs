**CVE-2015-5254**

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of Java objects within JMS ObjectMessages in Apache ActiveMQ.  The broker deserializes the message payload in several places like web console or stomp object message transformation. This deserialization of untrusted data allows for potential security flaws.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is that ActiveMQ doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the classes that can be deserialized, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **JMS ObjectMessage Handling:** The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of JMS ObjectMessages where Java serialization is used for marshaling and unmarshaling the message payload.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The broker doesn't validate or sanitize the serialized data before deserializing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using a JMS ObjectMessage.
- **Information Disclosure:** Malicious objects might disclose sensitive information during deserialization.
- **Message Spoofing:** Attackers may be able to spoof messages using this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JMS Message Manipulation:** Attackers can send specially crafted JMS ObjectMessages containing malicious serialized objects.
- **Broker Interaction:** Vulnerable points within the broker include the web console or stomp object message transformation.
- **Client Applications:** Applications consuming `ObjectMessage` types are also vulnerable if they deserialize objects with the `ObjectMessage.getObject()` call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the ActiveMQ broker or vulnerable client application.
- **Ability to Send Malicious JMS Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the broker that it will process, either via a producer they control or potentially through other injection points if available.
- **Authentication:** Some comments suggest the attacker would need to authenticate to the EAP in order to send messages.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered due to how Java serialization is used within JMS ObjectMessages.
- The fix involves restricting the classes that can be serialized.
- The upstream fix is in Apache ActiveMQ 5.13.0
-  Mitigation requires listing trusted packages if using ObjectMessage type messages to prevent malicious deserialization
-  Java agents can be used to restrict classes that can be deserialized.

**Affected Products:**
- Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.0.0 through 5.12.1 and potentially client applications consuming ObjectMessage
- Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.2
- Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3
- Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3
- Debian (activemq package)

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.13.0 or later.
- Explicitly list trusted packages when using ObjectMessage message type.
- Consider using a Java agent to restrict deserialization or utilize JEP 290 to mitigate the issue.
