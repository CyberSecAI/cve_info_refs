Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5174:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The official CVE description is missing but the provided content indicates the vulnerability is a directory traversal vulnerability present in Apache Tomcat. This is related to how Tomcat handles pathnames in `getResource()`, `getResourceAsStream()`, and `getResourcePaths()` methods.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect validation of paths used in `ServletContext` methods: `getResource()`, `getResourceAsStream()`, and `getResourcePaths()`. Specifically, it failed to reject paths of the form `"/.."`, although it correctly rejected paths starting with `"/../"`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to navigate to parent directories. This is due to insufficient validation of paths.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could obtain directory listings for locations outside the web application's intended directory. Specifically, this could expose the `$CATALINA_BASE/webapps` directory, a potentially sensitive area of the server.
*   **Security Manager Bypass:** The vulnerability allows a malicious application to bypass the security manager that is meant to restrict access to resources.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious web application running on the same Tomcat server.
*   **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability was only exploitable if a malicious web application was deployed and could access the affected methods. Some content suggests that the user would need to be authenticated.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to deploy a malicious web application that can access the affected `ServletContext` methods within the same Tomcat instance.
*   The malicious web application must be running under a security manager for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Technical Details and Descriptions**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `RequestUtil.java` component of Tomcat.
*   The vulnerability was present in Apache Tomcat versions 6.x before 6.0.45, 7.x before 7.0.65 and 8.x before 8.0.27.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involved correcting the path validation logic in the `RequestUtil.java` file and included additional tests cases.
*   The fix adds a check to ensure that paths of the form `/..` are rejected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided data suggests this vulnerability is considered a "low" severity issue by Tomcat and Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered when a Security Manager is configured on the Tomcat instance.
*   The vulnerability is related to how Tomcat is interpreting paths given in requests to access resources.
*   Multiple sources specify that this vulnerability is only exploitable when a security manager is present.
