Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-5255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the processing of XML External Entity (XXE) requests within Flex BlazeDS, an Adobe component that is also used by other products.
*   Specifically, crafted XML documents sent to the server were not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The core vulnerability is an SSRF issue, arising from the improper parsing of crafted XML documents.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Processing:** This is the underlying mechanism that allows an attacker to perform the SSRF. The vulnerability is triggered when external entities within the XML are processed, leading to unintended access of resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful attack could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The specific nature of the information is not explicitly described but it's related to the server itself or internal network, as that is the nature of SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery:** By exploiting the vulnerable XML parsing, an attacker could potentially force the server to make requests to internal or external resources. This could be used to scan internal networks, access internal services or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted XML Requests:** The primary attack vector is the submission of specially crafted XML requests to vulnerable server endpoints using Flex BlazeDS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the affected server. No special privileges are mentioned
*   **Ability to send XML requests:** Attacker must be able to craft and send XML requests

**Affected Products:**

Multiple products are affected by the same vulnerability, namely:

*   **VMware Products:**
    *   vCenter Server (versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.5 prior to specified updates)
