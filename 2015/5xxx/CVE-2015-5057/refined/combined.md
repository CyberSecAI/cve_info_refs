## Description

The fastest and most accurate broken link checker for WordPress. Join over 700K people who use Broken Link Checker to monitor and detect broken links 20x faster than other plugins, with pinpoint accuracy. No page limits, no ads, no upsells. Enjoy effortless, unlimited, and automated broken link checking from the get-go.

**Broken links can kill your SEO, user experience, and site health… Broken Link Checker helps you find and resolve them faster than similar plugins.**

Finding and staying on top of broken links can feel like a never-ending battle, especially if you’re dealing with large sites or managing multiple.

Using a link checking tool can save you from having to find links manually, or avoid the frustration of discovering missed broken links months later (oops!).

But not every broken link checker was created equal…

You need a tool that not only automates the process, but also detects broken links quickly, thoroughly, and accurately.

**That’s where Broken Link Checker comes in…**

BLC doesn’t *just* scan your sites faster than other solutions, it scans deeply and frequently to ensure no broken links are missed.

Scan every inch of your sites, including external and internal links within your posts, pages, comments, blogroll, even custom fields, helping to ensure your site’s SEO and user experience are not compromised in any way. And if that isn’t enough, you’ll also receive detection reports via email so you can quickly take corrective action.

**Choose from two different link checking engines:**

Broken Link Checker gives you the option of using two unique engines based on your needs. You can also easily switch between local and cloud broken link checking **without losing your saved settings.**

**1.Cloud-based link checker**

This engine is 100% cloud-based and built directly on WPMU DEV’s servers (the owners of BLC), harnessing their powerful API.

*Note that our cloud-based engine is still in beta. We’re working around the clock to make this new version even better. As mentioned, if it’s missing a feature you need, simply switch back to the local version.*

This cloud-based engine gives you several advantages, including:

* **20x more speed** – Being cloud-based eliminates any dependence on the performance of your server, giving you a massive speed increase.
* **Unlimited page & URL checker** – Enjoy limitless scanning for pages and URLs, ideal if you’re working with multiple sites or large sites with a lot of content.
* **Edit/unlink broken links (coming soon)** – Effortlessly resolve all detected links right from your BLC dashboard.
* **Crawl it all** – Standard pages and posts, menus, category pages… BLC ensures no URL is missed.
* **Any site, any size** – Unlike plugin-based solutions, BLC is server-independent, making it capable of checking sites of any size and type.
* **Fewer errors** – BLC’s cloud-based nature eliminates the occurrence of WP Errors, Fatal Errors, DB Errors, and PHP Errors often present with other plugins.
* **Less chance of being blocked** – The cloud-based engine doesn’t use your site’s IP address to check external URLs, meaning you’re less likely to be blocked due to frequent requests.

**Plus, manage broken links for unlimited sites from one place**

Since the cloud-based engine connects you to WPMU DEV, you have the luxury of free access to their suite of powerful web development tools – including a convenient site management interface where you can manage broken links on multiple sites, rather than just one.

**2. Local link checker**

The main difference of our local link checker compared to the cloud engine, is that it uses your site/server resources to fetch and analyze site content and check the status of links.

It also uses your site’s IP address, which as mentioned above, increases your risk of being blocked by some external links, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate scan results.

**Here are the standout features of the local link checking engine:**

* Monitors external links and internal links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects broken links and redirects.
* Receive notifications via your dashboard or email.
* Make broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Prevent search engines from following broken links (optional).
* Search and filter links by URL, anchor text and more.
* Edit links directly from your interface, without manually updating each post.

Whether you choose local or cloud-based, BLC’s user-friendly dashboard and powerful features makes staying on top of broken links as easy and automated as possible.

### The best scanning & detection features on one dashboard:

**Run manual scans or set an automatic schedule**

Enjoy the flexibility to run scans manually, or schedule automatic daily, weekly, and monthly scans to suit your preference and the sites you manage.

**Edit or unlink broken links (coming soon to cloud-based)**

After BLC detects broken links, it gives you the option to edit or unlink them with a click from your main dashboard. It couldn’t be easier or faster.

**Detailed broken link reports**

After each scan you get a comprehensive summary of any broken links detected, along with the status of the links so you can instantly know how to resolve the issue.

**Detection notifications via email**

Stay on top of your link health and fix issues as fast as possible with broken link reports sent straight to an email address of your choice.

**Advanced search filtering**

BLC’s search and filtering tools make it faster and easier to find specific URLs or filter by status or error type.

**Export report lists for further analysis**

Export your broken link lists as a CSV file for greater analysis inside of Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and other spreadsheet/data software.

Uninstalling now, it rates hundreds of referral links as 403, not workable.However, I would rate it 4 stars as the support was very good. And the help they offered was refused by the site referring to, so their fault, not Broken Link checker.I hope their will be a work-around this issue at some point.

I’m still using the local checker, not the cloud version, because I’d rather keep the backend data myself if I can. It does a great job checking and classifying all the links on your site and making them searchable and easily editable. I particularly like that it can update redirected links, check the Wayback Machine for missing ones, and makes it easy to update one at a time or in bulk.

Плагин работает, регулярно присылает письмо с неработающими ссылками и картинками. Облачная версия совсем не понравилась, неудобная. А в локальной версии есть серьезная недоработка. Если у вас несколько тысяч битых картинок, то удалить их можно только партиями по 30 шт. Было бы хорошо, если можно было задать количество отображаемых ссылок на странице, к примеру 100-300-500-1000 ссылок.

Broken Link Checker is an incredibly helpful plugin that I use frequently. One of its standout features is the ability to edit broken links directly from the plugin’s panel without having to open and modify the article itself.
A suggestion for improvement would be to update the modification date of the article when fixing a link. This would signal to search engines that the article has been updated, reflecting the correction of the broken link. Overall, a fantastic plugin that I highly recommend!

This plugin used to be great but since being taken over by WPMU and the PRO CLOUD version being released, it dies not find any broken links anymore.
I found an alternative plugin in the Wordpress Directory, which worked great out of the box and discovered more than 200 broken links within a couple of hours.
What happened to Broken Link Checker?

* Added a “Fix redirect” link action. It replaces a redirect with a direct link. It is hidden by default and can be enabled through the settings page.
* Added a “Recheck” link action. Unlike the bulk action by the same name, it checks a link immediately and displays the results without having to refresh the page.

* Enabled the YouTube video checker by default on new installations.

* Added an option to sort links by link text. May produce unexpected results for links that have multiple copies with different anchor text.
* Added a Vietnamese translation.
* Added file-based logging for debugging purposes. Logging can be enabled in the “Advanced” section of the plugin settings page.
* Added a “Auto-Submitted: auto-generated” header to notification emails sent by the plugin. This should prevent “out-of-office” auto-responders and similar software from responding to these emails.
* Added domain-based rate limiting to the HTTP checker module.
* Throttled background parsing by about 40% to reduce overall resource usage.
* Fixed (probably) a long-standing bug related to encoding international characters in link URLs.

## Description

The fastest and most accurate broken link checker for WordPress. Join over 700K people who use Broken Link Checker to monitor and detect broken links 20x faster than other plugins, with pinpoint accuracy. No page limits, no ads, no upsells. Enjoy effortless, unlimited, and automated broken link checking from the get-go.

**Broken links can kill your SEO, user experience, and site health… Broken Link Checker helps you find and resolve them faster than similar plugins.**

Finding and staying on top of broken links can feel like a never-ending battle, especially if you’re dealing with large sites or managing multiple.

Using a link checking tool can save you from having to find links manually, or avoid the frustration of discovering missed broken links months later (oops!).

But not every broken link checker was created equal…

You need a tool that not only automates the process, but also detects broken links quickly, thoroughly, and accurately.

**That’s where Broken Link Checker comes in…**

BLC doesn’t *just* scan your sites faster than other solutions, it scans deeply and frequently to ensure no broken links are missed.

Scan every inch of your sites, including external and internal links within your posts, pages, comments, blogroll, even custom fields, helping to ensure your site’s SEO and user experience are not compromised in any way. And if that isn’t enough, you’ll also receive detection reports via email so you can quickly take corrective action.

**Choose from two different link checking engines:**

Broken Link Checker gives you the option of using two unique engines based on your needs. You can also easily switch between local and cloud broken link checking **without losing your saved settings.**

**1.Cloud-based link checker**

This engine is 100% cloud-based and built directly on WPMU DEV’s servers (the owners of BLC), harnessing their powerful API.

*Note that our cloud-based engine is still in beta. We’re working around the clock to make this new version even better. As mentioned, if it’s missing a feature you need, simply switch back to the local version.*

This cloud-based engine gives you several advantages, including:

* **20x more speed** – Being cloud-based eliminates any dependence on the performance of your server, giving you a massive speed increase.
* **Unlimited page & URL checker** – Enjoy limitless scanning for pages and URLs, ideal if you’re working with multiple sites or large sites with a lot of content.
* **Edit/unlink broken links (coming soon)** – Effortlessly resolve all detected links right from your BLC dashboard.
* **Crawl it all** – Standard pages and posts, menus, category pages… BLC ensures no URL is missed.
* **Any site, any size** – Unlike plugin-based solutions, BLC is server-independent, making it capable of checking sites of any size and type.
* **Fewer errors** – BLC’s cloud-based nature eliminates the occurrence of WP Errors, Fatal Errors, DB Errors, and PHP Errors often present with other plugins.
* **Less chance of being blocked** – The cloud-based engine doesn’t use your site’s IP address to check external URLs, meaning you’re less likely to be blocked due to frequent requests.

**Plus, manage broken links for unlimited sites from one place**

Since the cloud-based engine connects you to WPMU DEV, you have the luxury of free access to their suite of powerful web development tools – including a convenient site management interface where you can manage broken links on multiple sites, rather than just one.

**2. Local link checker**

The main difference of our local link checker compared to the cloud engine, is that it uses your site/server resources to fetch and analyze site content and check the status of links.

It also uses your site’s IP address, which as mentioned above, increases your risk of being blocked by some external links, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate scan results.

**Here are the standout features of the local link checking engine:**

* Monitors external links and internal links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects broken links and redirects.
* Receive notifications via your dashboard or email.
* Make broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Prevent search engines from following broken links (optional).
* Search and filter links by URL, anchor text and more.
* Edit links directly from your interface, without manually updating each post.

Whether you choose local or cloud-based, BLC’s user-friendly dashboard and powerful features makes staying on top of broken links as easy and automated as possible.

### The best scanning & detection features on one dashboard:

**Run manual scans or set an automatic schedule**

Enjoy the flexibility to run scans manually, or schedule automatic daily, weekly, and monthly scans to suit your preference and the sites you manage.

**Edit or unlink broken links (coming soon to cloud-based)**

After BLC detects broken links, it gives you the option to edit or unlink them with a click from your main dashboard. It couldn’t be easier or faster.

**Detailed broken link reports**

After each scan you get a comprehensive summary of any broken links detected, along with the status of the links so you can instantly know how to resolve the issue.

**Detection notifications via email**

Stay on top of your link health and fix issues as fast as possible with broken link reports sent straight to an email address of your choice.

**Advanced search filtering**

BLC’s search and filtering tools make it faster and easier to find specific URLs or filter by status or error type.

**Export report lists for further analysis**

Export your broken link lists as a CSV file for greater analysis inside of Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and other spreadsheet/data software.

Uninstalling now, it rates hundreds of referral links as 403, not workable.However, I would rate it 4 stars as the support was very good. And the help they offered was refused by the site referring to, so their fault, not Broken Link checker.I hope their will be a work-around this issue at some point.

even if it’s not 100% correct, it does a great job in supervising all the Links on a website

I’m still using the local checker, not the cloud version, because I’d rather keep the backend data myself if I can. It does a great job checking and classifying all the links on your site and making them searchable and easily editable. I particularly like that it can update redirected links, check the Wayback Machine for missing ones, and makes it easy to update one at a time or in bulk.

Плагин работает, регулярно присылает письмо с неработающими ссылками и картинками. Облачная версия совсем не понравилась, неудобная. А в локальной версии есть серьезная недоработка. Если у вас несколько тысяч битых картинок, то удалить их можно только партиями по 30 шт. Было бы хорошо, если можно было задать количество отображаемых ссылок на странице, к примеру 100-300-500-1000 ссылок.

Broken Link Checker is an incredibly helpful plugin that I use frequently. One of its standout features is the ability to edit broken links directly from the plugin’s panel without having to open and modify the article itself.
A suggestion for improvement would be to update the modification date of the article when fixing a link. This would signal to search engines that the article has been updated, reflecting the correction of the broken link. Overall, a fantastic plugin that I highly recommend!

This plugin used to be great but since being taken over by WPMU and the PRO CLOUD version being released, it dies not find any broken links anymore.
I found an alternative plugin in the Wordpress Directory, which worked great out of the box and discovered more than 200 broken links within a couple of hours.
What happened to Broken Link Checker?

#### 1.9.4.2

* Added a Vietnamese translation.
* Added file-based logging for debugging purposes. Logging can be enabled in the “Advanced” section of the plugin settings page.
* Added a “Auto-Submitted: auto-generated” header to notification emails sent by the plugin. This should prevent “out-of-office” auto-responders and similar software from responding to these emails.

* Added a Hebrew translation.
* Added support for HTML code in custom fields. To make the plugin treat a field as HTML, prefix its name with “html:” in BLC settings. For example, if you have a custom field named “foo” that contains HTML, enter it as “html:foo”.

* Fixed: Email notifications will only include the “see all broken links here” link if the recipient can actually access that link.
* Fixed some UI labels not being localizable.
* The “Undismiss” action is now displayed in all views instead of only the “Dismissed” view. This way you can tell if a broken link has been dismissed without having to search the “Dismissed” list.

#### 1.8.3

* Switched over to storing plugin settings as JSON instead of serialized PHP arrays.

#### 1.7.1

* Added an Arabic translation.
* Updated Portuguese translation.
* Updated French translation.

* Fixed a bug where the plugin would sometimes report broken Twitter links as working.

* Disabled the news link (if any) for users who have donated.
* Removed support for pre-WP 2.9 post meta actions.

* Updated Danish, Germa, Italian, French and Simplified Chinese translations.

#### 1.6.2

* Another attempt to fix the “database not up to date” that some users are still experiencing even with 1.6.1.

#### 1.6.1

* Fixed the “database not up to date” bug. Now the plugin should properly upgrade the DB.

#### 1.6

* Added a way to dismiss links. Dismissed links don’t show up in the “Broken” and “Redirects” lists, but are still checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. strike-through for broken links). Useful if you want to, for example, acknowledge that a link is broken and leave it be.
* Added a “Redirect URL” column. For redirects this will display the URL that the link redirects to. For normal, non-redirected links, it will be empty. This column is hidden by default. You can enable it in the “Screen Options” panel.
