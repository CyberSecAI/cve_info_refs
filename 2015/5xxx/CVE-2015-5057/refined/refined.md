Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5057:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of HTTP headers within the "Broken Link Checker" WordPress plugin. Specifically, log data visible in the "Details" view was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that malicious code could be stored in the database via a crafted HTTP header and executed every time an admin views the vulnerable page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code into the admin panel of the WordPress site. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Account takeover by stealing administrator session cookies or credentials.
    - Defacement of the website's administration interface.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Further compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating HTTP headers when submitting requests, likely during a link checking process done by the plugin. The response containing the log data is then displayed unsanitized on the "Details" page, triggering the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability as a low privileged user. This indicates the vulnerability could be triggered by users with access to the plugin's features, or through other means of inserting malicious headers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.10.9 of the plugin.
- The provided text includes references to other security fixes in earlier versions of the plugin, including another XSS vulnerability fixed in version 1.11.20 and CSRF/XSS vulnerability in 1.10.6 as well as an XSS vulnerability in 1.10.5
