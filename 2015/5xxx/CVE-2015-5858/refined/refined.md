The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-5858.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A URL parsing vulnerability existed in the handling of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect URL parsing in the HSTS implementation.
- Failure to properly handle HSTS which can lead to bypassing HSTS protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A maliciously crafted URL may bypass HSTS and leak sensitive data.
- This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by forcing a connection to be downgraded from HTTPS to HTTP.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URLs.
- Visiting a malicious website containing the crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to get a user to visit a malicious URL.
- A privileged network position is not required for exploitation, but may be needed to fully exploit the vulnerability (e.g., downgrading HTTPS to HTTP to intercept traffic).
