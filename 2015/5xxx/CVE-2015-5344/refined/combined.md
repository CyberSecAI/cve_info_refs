Hash: SHA512
=============================================
CVE-2015-5344: Apache Camel's XStream usage is vulnerable
to Remote Code Execution attacks
Severity: MEDIUM
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: Camel 2.15.0 to 2.15.4, Camel 2.16.0
The unsupported Camel 2.x (2.14 and earlier) versions may be also affected.
Description: Apache Camel's camel-xstream component is vulnerable to Java object
de-serialisation vulnerability. Such as de-serializing untrusted data can lead
to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues.
Mitigation: 2.15.x users should upgrade to 2.15.5, 2.16.0 users should
upgrade to 2.16.1. And if you are using camel-xstream to serialize payload to Java objects,
then you need to explicitly list trusted packages.
To see how to do that, please take a look at: http://camel.apache.org/xstream
The JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-9297
refers to the various commits that resovoled the issue, and have more details.
Credit: This issue was discovered by Christian Schneider.
A related xstream de-serialization vulnerability was recently reported for Apache ActiveMQ:
http://activemq.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2015-5254-announcement.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1449589734000&api=v2

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-12-18 14:15:31 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Apache Camel:  Apache Camel's Jetty/Servlet usage is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability  If using camel-jetty, or camel-servlet as a consumer in Camel routes, then Camel will automatic de-serialize HTTP requests that uses the content-header: application/x-java-serialized-object.  External References:  <https://camel.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2015-5348.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2015-12-21 01:59:08 UTC  ``` Tracker for Fuse 6.2.1: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ENTESB-4744>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c2)  Jason Shepherd    2015-12-21 02:06:15 UTC  ``` Tracker for A-MQ 6.2.1: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ENTMQ-1464>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c4)  Jason Shepherd    2016-01-19 00:33:58 UTC  ``` [CVE-2015-5348](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5348) is currently scheduled to be fixed in the Fuse 6.3 release. It is ranked as having moderate impact, so we feel it's not worthy of including in a cumulative patch for 6.1.x.  [CVE-2015-5348](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5348) is more of a programming weakness than an actual vulnerability. The fact that Camel deserialises objects it not necessarily a vulnerability. However if there is a 'gadget chain', [0] in any library on the class path of the Camel Jetty route which deserialises those objects, then that could lead to remote code execution if a malicious object is sent to the Camel route with the 'content-header: application/x-java-serialized-object' HTTP Header.  [0] <http://jasonshepherd.net/2015/11/27/deserialization-in-java-collection-of-thoughts/>  Recently we released a patch for JBoss Fuse 6.x, ([CVE-2015-7501](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7501)) that removes a 'gadget chain' in the Apache commons-collection library. Therefore I think the best mitigation you could take for [CVE-2015-5348](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5348), is to apply that patch in order to remove the chance of it being exploited.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c5)  Pavel Polischouk    2016-04-07 20:45:47 UTC  ``` Tracker for FSW 6.2.1: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ENTESB-4744>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1292849#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-06 16:19:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3  Via RHSA-2016:2035 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2035.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1310647#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-02-22 12:25:56 UTC  ```  An application that includes BeanShell on the classpath may be vulnerable if another part of the application uses Java serialization or XStream to deserialize data from an untrusted source.  A vulnerable application could be exploited for remote code execution, including executing arbitrary shell commands.

Issued:

Updated:

# RHSA-2016:2035 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3, which fixes multiple security issues and includes several bug fixes and enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes document, available from the Product Documentation link in the References section, for a list of these changes.

Security Fix(es):

It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt and auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability to send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information disclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks. (CVE-2016-2141)

A deserialization flaw allowing remote code execution was found in the BeanShell library. If BeanShell was on the classpath, it could permit code execution if another part of the application deserialized objects involving a specially constructed chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the BeanShell library. (CVE-2016-2510)

It was found that Apache Shiro uses a default cipher key for its "remember me" feature. An attacker could use this to devise a malicious request parameter and gain access to unauthorized content. (CVE-2016-4437)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Spring processes inline DTD declarations. A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted XML file that would cause out-of-memory errors when parsed. (CVE-2015-3192)

It was found that Apache Camel's camel-xstream component was vulnerable to Java object deserialization. This vulnerability permits deserialization of data which could lead to information disclosure, code execution, or other possible attacks. (CVE-2015-5344)

It was found that Apache Camel's Jetty/Servlet permitted object deserialization. If using camel-jetty or camel-servlet as a consumer in Camel routes, then Camel will automatically deserialize HTTP requests that use the content-header: application/x-java-serialized-object. An attacker could use this vulnerability to gain access to unauthorized information or conduct further attacks. (CVE-2015-5348)

It was found that bouncycastle is vulnerable to an invalid curve attack. An attacker could extract private keys used in elliptic curve cryptography with a few thousand queries. (CVE-2015-7940)

The CVE-2016-2141 issue was discovered by Dennis Reed (Red Hat).

Refer to the Product Documentation link in the References section for installation instructions.
