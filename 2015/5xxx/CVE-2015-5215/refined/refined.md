Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Ipsilon Identity Provider (IdP) server used the default configuration of the Jinja templating engine.
*   This default configuration did not automatically HTML escape template variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Failure to properly escape user-controlled input within templates allowed for injection of malicious HTML or scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious code into the Ipsilon server's web pages.
*   This code would then be executed in the context of a user's browser when they visited the page.
*   The impact could range from defacement to session hijacking and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious input into template variables that are rendered in the user's browser.
*   This injection can occur through any input that is not properly sanitized and is used within a template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject untrusted input into the Ipsilon server.
*   This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or through interacting with the service through a web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Ipsilon versions 0.1.0 to 1.0.0.
*   The fix was implemented by enabling auto-escaping in the Jinja template engine.
*   The fix is included in versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.0 of Ipsilon.

The provided information gives a clear picture of the XSS vulnerability due to insecure Jinja template configuration, which is not described in the placeholder CVE description.
