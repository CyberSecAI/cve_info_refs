Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-5242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way `swiftonfile` (also known as `gluster-swift`), which is used in Red Hat Gluster Storage, serializes and stores metadata on disk. It uses Python's `pickle` module for this purpose.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of Python's `pickle` module. The `pickle` module is known to be insecure when used to deserialize data from untrusted sources. This is because `pickle` can deserialize arbitrary Python objects, including those that execute code.
*   **Metadata Storage:**  `swiftonfile` stores metadata as extended attributes (xattrs) of directories or files, and these xattrs are serialized using the `pickle` format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote, authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the storage node. This would allow the attacker to completely compromise the storage server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable in deployments where a user has access to the backend file system through FUSE or SMB.
*   **Malicious Metadata Injection:** An attacker with access to the file system interface can store malicious code as xattrs. When this metadata is deserialized using `pickle`, it executes the embedded code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs some level of access to the backend filesystem where `swiftonfile` stores the metadata. This access could be over FUSE or SMB.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a result of using Python's insecure `pickle` module to serialize and store metadata in `swiftonfile`. An authenticated user with access to the filesystem can inject malicious code into the metadata, leading to remote code execution on the storage node when the metadata is deserialized.
