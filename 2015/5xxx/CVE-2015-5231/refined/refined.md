{
  "CVE-2015-5231": {
    "description": "The service daemon in CRIU does not properly restrict access to non-dumpable processes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via (1) process dumps or (2) ptrace access.",
    "root_cause": "The criu service daemon does not properly enforce restrictions on process dumping or ptrace access, allowing users to bypass intended security policies.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient access control to non-dumpable processes",
      "Failure to enforce configured security policies regarding process dumping and ptrace access"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can obtain sensitive information by dumping processes they should not have access to or gaining unauthorized ptrace access. This could lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the service daemon to perform process dumps of non-dumpable processes.",
      "Using the service daemon to gain unauthorized ptrace access."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a local user with matching user and group IDs of the target process.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is related to how the criu service daemon handles process dumping and ptrace access, potentially allowing bypass of intended security restrictions. This issue was discussed upstream and a temporary workaround was implemented by disabling the systemd service."
