The provided document contains details of security content in iOS 9, including several vulnerabilities.

The following vulnerability details relate to **CVE-2015-5906**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An issue existed in WebKit's handling of password input context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allowed QuickType (the predictive keyboard) to learn the last character of a password in a filled-in web form. This is due to how WebKit was handling password input context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is the potential leakage of password information to the QuickType learning mechanism. This could enable an attacker with access to the device to potentially uncover the last character of passwords entered into web forms.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a website using password input fields, potentially a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be privileged. They would need to have access to the device. The attack involves the user using Webkit to fill out a web form containing a password field.
