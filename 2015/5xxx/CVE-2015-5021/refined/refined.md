Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-default port for the DataStage engine within IBM InfoSphere Information Server. When a non-default port is configured, it leads to a situation where project-specific role assignments are not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated DataStage users can connect to projects without having the necessary project-specific roles assigned to them. This allows them to bypass intended access controls.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to correctly validate user privileges when a non-default port is used, allowing unauthorized access to projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can potentially view sensitive information within DataStage projects.
*   **Unauthorized Job Execution:** Users can execute jobs within projects without having the required privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the DataStage engine.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of DataStage or QualityStage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for DataStage or QualityStage.
*   **Non-default Port Configuration:** The vulnerable system must be configured to use a non-default port for the DataStage engine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IBM InfoSphere Information Server versions 11.3 and 11.5.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by applying the security patch associated with APAR JR54224.
*   The CVSS v3 vector is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a network-based attack, requiring low privileges, with low impact on confidentiality and integrity.
