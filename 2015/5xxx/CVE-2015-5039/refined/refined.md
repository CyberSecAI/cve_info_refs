**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper hostname validation of the server SSL certificate in IBM Rational ClearCase.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of server SSL certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can view and modify network traffic to the CCRC WAN server or change management server.
- An attacker can impersonate the server or the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network traffic to the CCRC WAN server or change management server when SSL/TLS (HTTPS) connections are used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A remote attacker capable of intercepting and manipulating network traffic.
- The attacker does not require user interaction or prior authentication (PR:N, UI:N).
- The attacker needs a position on the network to intercept traffic.
