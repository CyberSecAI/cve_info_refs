# Unhacking the hacked Jeep® SUV

[By Blog Editor](https://blog.stellantisnorthamerica.com/author/blog-editor/)

**July 24, 2015 update:** Click to read about the additional measures that FCA US has taken to ensure the security of the vehicles with particular [8.4-inch touchscreen systems](http://bit.ly/Unhacking-UPDATE).

*Updated to clarify: Due to market access to cellular connectivity, the 8.4 touchscreen issue noted in the blog post is for vehicles sold only in the U.S*.

We read about “hacks” every day. All industries are potential targets of a hacker and the automotive industry has been no exception.

Well-known hackers [Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek recently teamed-up](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) with a WIRED reporter to publish a story that you may have read about or seen on the news. The story highlights how Miller and Valasek hacked into Miller’s 2014 Jeep® Cherokee and remotely controlled some functions. Miller and Valasek have been working on intentionally hacking into Miller’s vehicle over the past year as part of their on-going research in the area of automotive cybersecurity and have communicated with FCA about some aspects of their work.

To FCA’s knowledge, *there has not been a single real world incident of an unlawful or unauthorized remote hack* into any FCA vehicle.

After becoming aware of the vulnerabilities in some 2013 and 2014 vehicles equipped with the 8.4 inch touchscreen systems, FCA US and several suppliers worked to fix the vulnerabilities in model year 2015 vehicles. FCA also created a software update that eliminates the vulnerabilities uncovered by Miller and Valasek in their laboratory tests. This software update is available to customers right now and can be downloaded to a USB drive from <http://www.driveuconnect.com/software-update/> and installed in a vehicle.

FCA will be contacting potentially affected customers with these details and has provided the software update to the FCA US dealer network for immediate customer installation.

Customers [can enter a vehicle identification number (VIN)](http://www.driveuconnect.com/software-update/) and find out if their vehicle needs the software update. If your vehicle needs the update, you can download the software update to a USB drive and install it yourself. Another option is to [make an appointment with your FCA US dealership](http://www.mopar.com/find-a-dealer/) and have them install it for you at no charge. The update, if installed DIY, will take 30-45 minutes, and your vehicle needs to be parked throughout the software update/installation process.

In addition, FCA US has been working with its suppliers to implement additional protocols to block remote access. These changes will not require any action by our customers.

The vehicles listed below that have a 8.4 inch touchscreen radio system need this software update:

* 2013-2014 Ram 1500 Pickup
* 2013-2014 Ram 3500 Cab Chassis
* 2013-2014 Ram 2500 Pickup
* 2013-2014 Ram 4500/5500 Cab Chassis
* 2013-2014 Ram 3500 Pickup
* 2014 Grand Cherokee
* 2014 Durango
* 2013-2014 Viper
* 2014 Cherokee
* Some 2015 Chrysler 200s

For any questions regarding how to complete the software update please call our Customer Care Center at 1-877-855-8400.

# Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It

I was driving 70 mph on the edge of downtown St. Louis when the exploit began to take hold.Save this storySaveSave this storySave

I was driving 70 mph on the edge of downtown St. Louis when the exploit began to take hold.

Though I hadn't touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system. Next the radio switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full volume. I spun the control knob left and hit the power button, to no avail. Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the glass.

As I tried to cope with all this, a picture of the two hackers performing these stunts appeared on the car's digital display: Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, wearing their trademark track suits. A nice touch, I thought.

The Jeep’s strange behavior wasn’t entirely unexpected. I'd come to St. Louis to be Miller and Valasek's digital crash-test dummy, a willing subject on whom they could test the car-hacking research they'd been doing over the past year. The result of their work was a hacking technique---what the security industry calls a zero-day exploit---that can target Jeep Cherokees and give the attacker wireless control, via the Internet, to any of thousands of vehicles. Their code is an automaker's nightmare: software that lets hackers send commands through the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboard functions, steering, brakes, and transmission, all from a laptop that may be across the country.

To better simulate the experience of driving a vehicle while it's being hijacked by an invisible, virtual force, Miller and Valasek refused to tell me ahead of time what kinds of attacks they planned to launch from Miller's laptop in his house 10 miles west. Instead, they merely assured me that they wouldn't do anything life-threatening. Then they told me to drive the Jeep onto the highway. "Remember, Andy," Miller had said through my iPhone's speaker just before I pulled onto the Interstate 64 on-ramp, "no matter what happens, don't panic."1

As the two hackers remotely toyed with the air-conditioning, radio, and windshield wipers, I mentally congratulated myself on my courage under pressure. That's when they cut the transmission.

Immediately my accelerator stopped working. As I frantically pressed the pedal and watched the RPMs climb, the Jeep lost half its speed, then slowed to a crawl. This occurred just as I reached a long overpass, with no shoulder to offer an escape. The experiment had ceased to be fun.

At that point, the interstate began to slope upward, so the Jeep lost more momentum and barely crept forward. Cars lined up behind my bumper before passing me, honking. I could see an 18-wheeler approaching in my rearview mirror. I hoped its driver saw me, too, and could tell I was paralyzed on the highway.

"You're doomed!" Valasek shouted, but I couldn't make out his heckling over the blast of the radio, now pumping Kanye West. The semi loomed in the mirror, bearing down on my immobilized Jeep.

I followed Miller's advice: I didn't panic. I did, however, drop any semblance of bravery, grab my iPhone with a clammy fist, and beg the hackers to make it stop.

Wireless Carjackers

This wasn't the first time Miller and Valasek had put me behind the wheel of a compromised car. In the summer of 2013, I drove a Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius around a South Bend, Indiana, parking lot while they sat in the backseat with their laptops, cackling as they [disabled my brakes, honked the horn, jerked the seat belt, and commandeered the steering wheel](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/). "When you lose faith that a car will do what you tell it to do," Miller observed at the time, "it really changes your whole view of how the thing works." Back then, however, their hacks had a comforting limitation: The attacker's PC had been wired into the vehicles' onboard diagnostic port, a feature that normally gives repair technicians access to information about the car's electronically controlled systems.

A mere two years later, that carjacking has gone wireless. Miller and Valasek plan to publish a portion of their exploit on the Internet, timed to a talk they're giving at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas next month. It’s the latest in a series of revelations from the two hackers that have spooked the automotive industry and even helped to inspire legislation; WIRED has learned that [senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal plan to introduce an automotive security bill today](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/senate-bill-seeks-standards-cars-defenses-hackers/) to set new digital security standards for cars and trucks, first sparked when Markey took note of Miller and Valasek’s work in 2013.

As an auto-hacking antidote, the bill couldn’t be timelier. The attack tools Miller and Valasek developed can remotely trigger more than the dashboard and transmission tricks they used against me on the highway. They demonstrated as much on the same day as my traumatic experience on I-64; After narrowly averting death by semi-trailer, I managed to roll the lame Jeep down an exit ramp, re-engaged the transmission by turning the ignition off and on, and found an empty lot where I could safely continue the experiment.

Miller and Valasek’s full arsenal includes functions that at lower speeds fully kill the engine, abruptly engage the brakes, or disable them altogether. The most disturbing maneuver came when they cut the Jeep's brakes, leaving me frantically pumping the pedal as the 2-ton SUV slid uncontrollably into a ditch. The researchers say they're working on perfecting their steering control---for now they can only hijack the wheel when the Jeep is in reverse. Their hack enables surveillance too: They can track a targeted Jeep's GPS coordinates, measure its speed, and even drop pins on a map to trace its route.

![Miller attempts to rescue the Jeep after its brakes were remotely disabled sending it into a ditch.](https://media.wired.com/photos/593238a226780e6c04d2a5c8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/IMG_0724.jpg)Andy Greenberg/WIRED

All of this is possible only because Chrysler, like practically all carmakers, is doing its best to turn the modern automobile into a smartphone. Uconnect, an Internet-connected computer feature in hundreds of thousands of Fiat Chrysler cars, SUVs, and trucks, controls the vehicle's entertainment and navigation, enables phone calls, and even offers a Wi-Fi hot spot. And thanks to one vulnerable element, which Miller and Valasek won't identify until their Black Hat talk, Uconnect's cellular connection also lets anyone who knows the car's IP address gain access from anywhere in the country. "From an attacker's perspective, it's a super nice vulnerability," Miller says.

From that entry point, Miller and Valasek's attack pivots to an adjacent chip in the car's head unit---the hardware for its entertainment system---silently rewriting the chip's firmware to plant their code. That rewritten firmware is capable of sending commands through the car's internal computer network, known as a CAN bus, to its physical components like the engine and wheels. Miller and Valasek say the attack on the entertainment system seems to work on any Chrysler vehicle with Uconnect from late 2013, all of 2014, and early 2015. They've only tested their full set of physical hacks, including ones targeting transmission and braking systems, on a Jeep Cherokee, though they believe that most of their attacks could be tweaked to work on any Chrysler vehicle with the vulnerable Uconnect head unit. They have yet to try remotely hacking into other makes and models of cars.

After the researchers reveal the details of their work in Vegas, only two things will prevent their tool from enabling a wave of attacks on Jeeps around the world. First, they plan to leave out the part of the attack that rewrites the chip’s firmware; hackers following in their footsteps will have to reverse-engineer that element, a process that took Miller and Valasek months. But the code they publish will enable many of the dashboard hijinks they demonstrated on me as well as GPS tracking.

Second, Miller and Valasek have been sharing their research with Chrysler for nearly nine months, enabling the company to quietly release a patch ahead of the Black Hat conference. On July 16, owners of vehicles with the Uconnect feature were notified of the patch in a [post on Chrysler's website](http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?&id=16827&mid=1) that didn’t offer any details or acknowledge Miller and Valasek’s research. “[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,” reads a statement a Chrysler spokesperson sent to WIRED. “FCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.”

> If consumers don't realize this is an issue, they should, and they should start complaining to carmakers. This might be the kind of software bug most likely to kill someone.

Charlie Miller

Unfortunately, Chrysler’s patch must be manually implemented via a USB stick or by a dealership mechanic. ([Download the update here](http://www.driveuconnect.com/software-update/).) That means many---if not most---of the vulnerable Jeeps will likely stay vulnerable.

Chrysler stated in a response to questions from WIRED that it “appreciates” Miller and Valasek’s work. But the company also seemed leery of their decision to publish part of their exploit. “Under no circumstances does FCA condone or believe it’s appropriate to disclose ‘how-to information’ that would potentially encourage, or help enable hackers to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to vehicle systems,” the company’s statement reads. “We appreciate the contributions of cybersecurity advocates to augment the industry’s understanding of potential vulnerabilities. However, we caution advocates that in the pursuit of improved public safety they not, in fact, compromise public safety.”

The two researchers say that even if their code makes it easier for malicious hackers to attack unpatched Jeeps, the release is nonetheless warranted because it allows their work to be proven through peer review. It also sends a message: Automakers need to be held accountable for their vehicles' digital security. "If consumers don't realize this is an issue, they should, and they should start complaining to carmakers," Miller says. "This might be the kind of software bug most likely to kill someone."

In fact, Miller and Valasek aren't the first to hack a car over the Internet. In 2011 a team of researchers from the University of Washington and the University of California at San Diego [showed that they could wirelessly disable the locks and brakes on a sedan](http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf). But those academics took a more discreet approach, keeping the identity of the hacked car secret and sharing the details of the exploit only with carmakers.

Miller and Valasek represent the second act in a good-cop/bad-cop routine. Carmakers who failed to heed polite warnings in 2011 now face the possibility of a public dump of their vehicles' security flaws. The result could be product recalls or even civil suits, says UCSD computer science professor Stefan Savage, who worked on the 2011 study. "Imagine going up against a class-action lawyer after Anonymous decides it would be fun to brick all the Jeep Cherokees in California," Savage says.2

For the auto industry and its watchdogs, in other words, Miller and Valasek's release may be the last warning before they see a full-blown zero-day attack. "The regulators and the industry can no longer count on the idea that exploit code won't be in the wild," Savage says. "They've been thinking it wasn't an imminent danger you needed to deal with. That implicit assumption is now dead."

Sitting on a leather couch in Miller's living room as a summer storm thunders outside, the two researchers scan the Internet for victims.

Uconnect computers are linked to the Internet by Sprint's cellular network, and only other Sprint devices can talk to them. So Miller has a cheap Kyocera Android phone connected to his battered MacBook. He's using the burner phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot, scouring for targets using its thin 3G bandwidth.

A set of GPS coordinates, along with a vehicle identification number, make, model, and IP address, appears on the laptop screen. It’s a Dodge Ram. Miller plugs its GPS coordinates into Google Maps to reveal that it’s cruising down a highway in Texarkana, Texas. He keeps scanning, and the next vehicle to appear on his screen is a Jeep Cherokee driving around a highway cloverleaf between San Diego and Anaheim, California. Then he locates a Dodge Durango, moving along a rural road somewhere in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. When I ask him to keep scanning, he hesitates. Seeing the actual, mapped locations of these unwitting strangers' vehicles---and knowing that each one is vulnerable to their remote attack---unsettles him.

When Miller and Valasek first found the Uconnect flaw, they thought it might only enable attacks over a direct Wi-Fi link, confining its range to a few dozen yards. When they discovered the Uconnect's cellular vulnerability earlier this summer, they still thought it might work only on vehicles on the same cell tower as their scanning phone, restricting the range of the attack to a few dozen miles. But they quickly found even that wasn't the limit. "When I saw we could do it anywhere, over the Internet, I freaked out," Valasek says. "I was frightened. It was like, holy fuck, that's a vehicle on a highway in the middle of the country. Car hacking got real, right then."

That moment was the culmination of almost three years of work. In the fall of 2012, Miller, a security researcher for Twitter and a former NSA hacker, and Valasek, the director of vehicle security research at the consultancy IOActive, were inspired by the UCSD and University of Washington study to apply for a car-hacking research grant from Darpa. With the resulting $80,000, they bought a Toyota Prius and a Ford Escape. They spent the next year tearing the vehicles apart digitally and physically, mapping out their electronic control units, or ECUs---the computers that run practically every component of a modern car---and learning to speak the CAN network protocol that controls them.

When they demonstrated a wired-in attack on those vehicles at the DefCon hacker conference in 2013, though, Toyota, Ford, and others in the automotive industry downplayed the significance of their work, pointing out that the hack had required physical access to the vehicles. Toyota, in particular, [argued that its systems were "robust and secure" against wireless attacks](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/). "We didn't have the impact with the manufacturers that we wanted," Miller says. To get their attention, they'd need to find a way to hack a vehicle remotely.

So the next year, they signed up for mechanic’s accounts on the websites of every major automaker and downloaded dozens of vehicles' technical manuals and wiring diagrams. Using those specs, they [rated 24 cars, SUVs, and trucks on three factors they thought might determine their vulnerability to hackers](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/car-hacking-chart/): How many and what types of radios connected the vehicle's systems to the Internet; whether the Internet-connected computers were properly isolated from critical driving systems, and whether those critical systems had "cyberphysical" components---whether digital commands could trigger physical actions like turning the wheel or activating brakes.

Based on that study, they rated Jeep Cherokee the most hackable model. Cadillac's Escalade and Infiniti's Q50 didn't fare much better; Miller and Valasek ranked them second- and third-most vulnerable. When WIRED told Infiniti that at least one of Miller and Valasek’s warnings had been borne out, the company responded in a statement that its engineers “look forward to the findings of this [new] study” and will “continue to integrate security features into our vehicles to protect against cyberattacks.” Cadillac emphasized in a written statement that the company has released a new Escalade since Miller and Valasek’s last study, but that cybersecurity is “an emerging area in which we are devoting more resources and tools,” including the recent hire of a chief product cybersecurity officer.

After Miller and Valasek decided to focus on the Jeep Cherokee in 2014, it took them another year of hunting for hackable bugs and reverse-engineering to prove their educated guess. It wasn't until June that Valasek issued a command from his laptop in Pittsburgh and turned on the windshield wipers of the Jeep in Miller's St. Louis driveway.

Since then, Miller has scanned Sprint's network multiple times for vulnerable vehicles and recorded their vehicle identification numbers. Plugging that data into an algorithm sometimes used for tagging and tracking wild animals to estimate their population size, he estimated that there are as many as 471,000 vehicles with vulnerable Uconnect systems on the road.

Pinpointing a vehicle belonging to a specific person isn't easy. Miller and Valasek's scans reveal random VINs, IP addresses, and GPS coordinates. Finding a particular victim’s vehicle out of thousands is unlikely through the slow and random probing of one Sprint-enabled phone. But enough phones scanning together, Miller says, could allow an individual to be found and targeted. Worse, he suggests, a skilled hacker could take over a group of Uconnect head units and use them to perform more scans---as with any collection of hijacked computers---worming from one dashboard to the next over Sprint’s network. The result would be a wirelessly controlled automotive botnet encompassing hundreds of thousands of vehicles.

“For all the critics in 2013 who said our work didn’t count because we were plugged into the dashboard,” Valasek says, “well, now what?”

Now the auto industry needs to do the unglamorous, ongoing work of actually protecting cars from hackers. And Washington may be about to force the issue.

Later today, senators Markey and Blumenthal intend to reveal new legislation designed to tighten cars’ protections against hackers. The bill (which a Markey spokesperson insists wasn’t timed to this story) will call on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to set new security standards and create a privacy and security rating system for consumers. “Controlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car,” Markey wrote in a statement to WIRED. “Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected...We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.”

Markey has keenly followed Miller and Valasek’s research for years. Citing their 2013 Darpa-funded research and hacking demo, he [sent a letter to 20 automakers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/12/04/heres-the-letter-a-senator-sent-to-20-auto-makers-demanding-answers-on-car-hacking-threats/), asking them to answer a series of questions about their security practices. The answers, [released in February](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/heres-full-senate-report-shaming-automakers-security/), show what Markey describes as "a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle." Of the 16 automakers who responded, all confirmed that virtually every vehicle they sell has some sort of wireless connection, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular service, and radios. (Markey didn't reveal the automakers' individual responses.) Only seven of the companies said they hired independent security firms to test their vehicles' digital security. Only two said their vehicles had monitoring systems that checked their CAN networks for malicious digital commands.

UCSD's Savage says the lesson of Miller and Valasek's research isn't that Jeeps or any other vehicle are particularly vulnerable, but that practically *any* modern vehicle could be vulnerable. "I don't think there are qualitative differences in security between vehicles today," he says. "The Europeans are a little bit ahead. The Japanese are a little bit behind. But broadly writ, this is something everyone's still getting their hands around."

![Miller  and Valasek demonstrated the rest of their attacks on the Jeep while I drove it around an empty parking lot.](https://media.wired.com/photos/593238a744db296121d69bf6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/150701_car_hackers_49.jpg)Whitney Curtis for WIRED

Aside from [wireless hacks used by thieves to open car doors](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/style/keeping-your-car-safe-from-electronic-thieves.html), only one malicious car-hacking attack has been documented: In 2010 a disgruntled employee in Austin, Texas, used a remote shutdown system meant for enforcing timely car payments to [brick more than 100 vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2010/03/hacker-bricks-cars/). But the opportunities for real-world car hacking have only grown, as automakers add wireless connections to vehicles' internal networks. Uconnect is just one of a dozen telematics systems, including GM Onstar, Lexus Enform, Toyota Safety Connect, Hyundai Bluelink, and Infiniti Connection.

In fact, automakers are thinking about their digital security more than ever before, says Josh Corman, the cofounder of I Am the Cavalry, a security industry organization devoted to protecting future Internet-of-things targets like automobiles and medical devices. Thanks to Markey's letter, and [another set of questions sent to automakers by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in May](http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/committee-leaders-seek-information-auto-cybersecurity), Corman says, Detroit has known for months that car security regulations are coming.

But Corman cautions that the same automakers have been more focused on competing with each other to install new Internet-connected cellular services for entertainment, navigation, and safety. (Payments for those services also provide a nice monthly revenue stream.) The result is that the companies have an incentive to add Internet-enabled features---but not to secure them from digital attacks. "They're getting worse faster than they're getting better," he says. "If it takes a year to introduce a new hackable feature, then it takes them four to five years to protect it."

Corman's group has been visiting auto industry events to push [five recommendations](https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/): safer design to reduce attack points, third-party testing, internal monitoring systems, segmented architecture to limit the damage from any successful penetration, and the same Internet-enabled security software updates that PCs now receive. The last of those in particular is already catching on; Ford [announced a switch to over-the-air updates in March](http://blog.caranddriver.com/ford-partners-with-microsoft-for-over-the-air-sync-infotainment-updates/), and BMW used wireless updates to [patch a hackable security flaw in door locks in January](https://securityledger.com/2015/02/bmw-fixes-connecteddrive-flaw-with-over-the-air-patch/).

Corman says carmakers need to befriend hackers who expose flaws, rather than fear or antagonize them---just as companies like Microsoft have evolved from threatening hackers with lawsuits to [inviting them to security conferences](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Dn456542.aspx) and [paying them “bug bounties” for disclosing security vulnerabilities](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Dn425036.aspx). For tech companies, Corman says, “that enlightenment took 15 to 20 years.” The auto industry can't afford to take that long. “Given that my car can hurt me and my family,” he says, “I want to see that enlightenment happen in three to five years, especially since the consequences for failure are flesh and blood.”

As I drove the Jeep back toward Miller’s house from downtown St. Louis, however, the notion of car hacking hardly seemed like a threat that will wait three to five years to emerge. In fact, it seemed more like a matter of seconds; I felt the vehicle's vulnerability, the nagging possibility that Miller and Valasek could cut the puppet's strings again at any time.

The hackers holding the scissors agree. “We shut down your engine---a big rig was honking up on you because of something we did on our couch,” Miller says, as if I needed the reminder. “This is what everyone who thinks about car security has worried about for years. This is a reality.”

*Update 3:30 7/24/2015*: Chrysler has [issued a recall for 1.4 million vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/jeep-hack-chrysler-recalls-1-4m-vehicles-bug-fix/) as a result of Miller and Valasek's research. The company has also blocked their wireless attack on Sprint's network to protect vehicles with the vulnerable software.

1*Correction 10:45 7/21/2015*: An earlier version of the story stated that the hacking demonstration took place on Interstate 40, when in fact it was Route 40, which coincides in St. Louis with Interstate 64.

2*Correction 1:00pm 7/27/2015*: An earlier version of this story referenced a Range Rover recall due to a hackable software bug that could unlock the vehicles' doors. While the software bug did lead to doors unlocking, it wasn't publicly determined to exploitable by hackers.

ICS Advisory
# Harman-Kardon Uconnect Vulnerability

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-260-01

## OVERVIEW

This advisory is a follow-up to the ICS-ALERT titled ICS-ALERT-15-203-01 FCA Uconnect VulnerabilityICS-CERT ALERT, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-15-203-01, web site last accessed September 17, 2015. that was published July 22, 2015, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Chris Valasek of IOActive and Dr. Charlie Miller of Twitter discovered an unauthorized remote access to Fiat-Chrysler Automobile US (FCA US) LLC Uconnect telematics infotainment system manufactured by Harman-Kardon. They had been coordinating with FCA US LLC for nearly 9 months before releasing information about this remote exploit publicly. FCA US LLC released a security notice and a firmware patch to owners of vehicles with the Uconnect feature on July 16, 2015. Subsequently, FCA US LLC launched two recall campaigns on July 23, 2015, and on September 5 where owners of vehicles were mailed USB sticks containing the updated software. The details of the exploit were released several weeks later at BlackHat 2015 and DefCon23 conventions held in early August in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Chris Valasek and Dr. Charlie Miller confirmed a missing authorization vulnerability in FCA Uconnect RA3/RA4 radio manufactured by Harman-Kardon. FCA US LLC has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability and worked with Sprint, the network provider to disable access to the vulnerable port. Prior to the Blackhat conference, the researchers have tested the patch to confirm that it mitigates the vulnerability.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following UConnect 8.4AN/RA3/RA4 infotainment systems are affected:

* 2013-2015 Ram 1500/2500/3500/4500/5500,
* 2013-2015 Dodge Viper,
* 2014/15 Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee,
* 2014/15 Dodge Durango,
* 2015 Chrysler 200/300,
* 2015 Dodge Challenger,
* 2015 Dodge Charger, and
* 2015 Jeep Renegade.

## IMPACT

The UConnect Infotainment system has direct access to the controls of the vehicle. A malicious party connecting to the UConnect infotainment system could without any form of authentication gain access to the UConnect system. From this connection, the malicious party could take control of connected control units and send commands to the various control systems within the vehicle with the potential to affect:

* Information to be displayed within the car (e.g., tachometer); and
* Vehicle control systems, including brakes, steering, and A/C fans.

Impact to individual vehicles depends on many factors that are unique to the features and make of the vehicle. ICS-CERT recommends that owners evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their own vehicle.

## BACKGROUND

Harman-Kardon is a division of Harman International Industries and manufactures home and car audio equipment and is headquartered in Stanford, Connecticut.

FCA US LLC is a North American automaker that maintains offices in several countries around the world and is headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

The affected products, Uconnect 8.4AN/RA3/RA4, are vehicle-based infotainment systems. According to FCA, the Uconnect systems are integrated in certain Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram makes of vehicles. FCA estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States and Europe.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### MISSING AUTHENTICATIONCWE-862: Missing Authorization, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html, web site last accessed September 17, 2015.

The UConnect infotainment system allowed an unauthenticated connection from other access points on the Sprint Network. After the release of the information on this vulnerability, Sprint blocked access to the vulnerable ports. A malicious party could then issue commands through the infotainment system to other components within the vehicle.

CVE-2015-5611NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5611, web site last accessed September 17, 2015. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 8.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed September 17, 2015.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

This vulnerability is no longer exploitable remotely because of Sprint’s reconfiguration on the cellular network. The software within the system is still vulnerable until patched.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

#### DIFFICULTY

Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability is difficult. Connections to the vulnerable UConnect systems are currently unreachable because of port screening by Sprint. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.

## MITIGATION

FCA has issued a voluntary recall of 1.4 million impacted vehicles to patch the software of the UConnect Infotainment system.

In addition, Sprint has disabled traffic to the vulnerable port on its network.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* If the Wi-Fi is used, encrypt the Wi-Fi with the WPA2 encryption option.
* Minimize network exposure for all connected devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Do not insert media (e.g., USB, SD card or CD) of unknown origin into your vehicle.  Only use devices that came from a trusted source.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
