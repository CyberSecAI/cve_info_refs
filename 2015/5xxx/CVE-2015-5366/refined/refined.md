    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP checksums.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The kernel does not properly handle invalid UDP checksums.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid checksum, or potentially trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of sending UDP packets."
