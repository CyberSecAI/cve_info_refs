- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in resetting failed passcode attempts with a backup of the iOS device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the logic used to reset failed passcode attempts when restoring from a backup.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could potentially bypass the passcode by restoring from a backup.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker requires local access to the device and a backup of the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with physical access to the device.
