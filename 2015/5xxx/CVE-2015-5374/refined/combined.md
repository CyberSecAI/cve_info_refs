# Siemens SIPROTEC Denial-of-Service Vulnerability

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-202-01

## OVERVIEW

Siemens has identified a denial-of-service vulnerability in the SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices. This vulnerability was reported directly to Siemens by Victor Nikitin from i‑Grids LLC Russia. Siemens has produced a new firmware update to mitigate this vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Siemens reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:

* SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact product families

* All devices that include the EN100 Ethernet module version V4.24 or prior.

## IMPACT

An attacker could remotely cause a denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.

The affected products, SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices, provide a wide range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation functions for electrical substations and other fields of application. The EN100 module is used for enabling IEC 61850 communications with electrical/optical 100 Mbit interface for SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices. According to Siemens, SIPROTEC devices are deployed across several sectors including Energy. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### DENIAL OF SERVICECWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, web site last accessed July 21, 2015.

Specially crafted packets sent to Port 50000/UDP could cause a denial of service of the affected device. A manual reboot is required to return the device to service.

CVE-2015-5374NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5374, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C, web site last accessed July 21, 2015.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

## MITIGATION

Siemens has provided firmware update V4.25 for the EN100 module to fix the vulnerability.

The firmware update for SIPROTEC 4 can be obtained here:

<http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-4>

The firmware update for SIPROTEC Compact can be obtained here:

<http://www.siemens.com/downloads/siprotec-compact>

For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-732541 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Configure firewall rules to appropriately restrict traffic to affected devices on Port 50000/UDP.
* Monitor traffic to affected devices on Port 50000/UDP with an intrusion detection system (IDS).
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
