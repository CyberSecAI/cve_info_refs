Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `header_anchor` function in the `redcarpet` library uses Variable Length Arrays (VLAs) without proper range checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The lack of bounds checking on the VLAs allows an attacker to potentially write beyond the allocated stack memory by providing excessively long header text, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful stack overflow can be exploited to overwrite return addresses or other sensitive data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing Markdown text that contains headers with excessively long titles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted Markdown content to the vulnerable `redcarpet` library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `redcarpet` versions 3.3.0 and 3.3.1.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.2.
*   The fix was introduced in commit `2cee777c1e5babe8a1e2683d31ea75cc4afe55fb`
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Giancarlo Canales Barreto.
