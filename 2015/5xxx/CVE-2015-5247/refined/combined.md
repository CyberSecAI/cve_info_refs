# Libvirt Security Notice: LSN-2015-0003

## denial of service through root-squash NFS storage pools

### Lifecycle

| Reported on: | 20150814 |

| Published on: | 20150903 |

* CVE-2015-5247

### Description

The virStorageVolCreateXML API had a bug where it could
create a volume on a root-squash NFS mount, but then fail to remove
that volume if later steps during the API encountered problems. This
was further compounded by code which used a wrong conditional on
whether the new volume needed to have permissions changed, making it
more likely to trigger the failed unlink attempt. Poor error handling
after a failed unlink left libvirt with an inconsistent view of the
storage volume that could then result in a libvirtd crash. While the
libvirtd crash might be delayed until by subsequent actions from a
read-only connection, the conditions that set up the crash can only be
triggered by a client with a read-write connection.

### Impact

When using fine-grained Access Control Lists (ACL), the
virStorageVolCreateXML API only requires the storage\_vol:create
permission. A client with this privilege but lacking the
more-powerful domain:write permission could exploit the API bugs to
cause a denial-of-service attack by taking down libvirtd
through a crash. It can also be argued that the ability to cause
libvirt to create files which it cannot delete can be used as a
denial-of-service attack on storage resources.

### Workaround

The problems with libvirt creating a file which it does not
then clean up on error is specific to root-squash NFS, so one
mitigation is avoiding the use of the root-squash option when
exporting NFS volumes for use by libvirt storage pools. Note that in
general, the use of root-squash NFS does not add any real security (it
makes certain tasks harder for a root user, but the root user can
trivially change ids to another user to still perform those tasks).
Furthermore, it is possible to prevent the denial of service attacks
by stopping the use of the fine grained access control mechanism
(while this does not prevent a crash, such a crash is no longer a
security problem as there is no longer a privilege boundary between a
user creating a volume and a user with full system access).

# USN-2867-1: libvirt vulnerabilities

12 January 2016

Several security issues were fixed in libvirt.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libvirt](/security/cves?package=libvirt) - Libvirt virtualization toolkit

## Details

It was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled the firewall rules on

bridge networks when the daemon was restarted. This could result in an

unintended firewall configuration. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04

LTS. ([CVE-2011-4600](/security/CVE-2011-4600))

Peter Krempa discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled locking when

certain ACL checks failed. A local attacker could use this issue to cause

libvirt to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue

only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-8136](/security/CVE-2014-8136))

Luyao Huang discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled VNC passwords in

shapshot and image files. A remote authenticated user could use this issue

to possibly obtain VNC passwords. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. ([CVE-2015-0236](/security/CVE-2015-0236))

Han Han discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled volume creation

failure when used with NFS. A remote authenticated user could use this

issue to cause libvirt to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10. ([CVE-2015-5247](/security/CVE-2015-5247))

Ossi Herrala and Joonas Kuorilehto discovered that libvirt incorrectly

performed storage pool name validation. A remote authenticated user could

use this issue to bypass ACLs and gain access to unintended files. This

issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.

([CVE-2015-5313](/security/CVE-2015-5313))
