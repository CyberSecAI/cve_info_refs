Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `virStorageVolCreateXML` API in libvirt had a flaw in how it handled volume creation on root-squash NFS mounts.
*   Specifically, if a volume was created successfully, but subsequent steps in the API failed (e.g., permission changes), the API failed to remove the volume.
*   A wrong conditional check related to permission changes exacerbated the issue, making it more likely to trigger the failed unlink attempt.
*   Poor error handling after a failed unlink operation left libvirt in an inconsistent state, which could lead to a crash of the `libvirtd` daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent State:** Libvirt can end up with an inconsistent view of storage volumes.
*   **Failed Cleanup:**  The inability to properly clean up created volumes on root-squash NFS.
*   **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** Flawed logic when determining if permissions need to be changed for a new volume.
*   **Poor Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling after a failed unlink operation.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability allows a user with limited access to cause libvirtd to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A client with storage\_vol:create permission (but without more extensive privileges like domain:write), can exploit the bug to crash the `libvirtd` daemon, resulting in a DoS.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The ability to create files that libvirt can't delete can be used to consume storage resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `virStorageVolCreateXML` API.
*   The attack relies on using a storage pool on a root-squash NFS mount.
*   A client with a read-write connection to libvirt is required to trigger the issue, while the `libvirtd` crash might be delayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a read-write connection to the libvirt daemon.
*   The attacker needs the `storage_vol:create` permission.
*   The attacker does not need the `domain:write` permission to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The storage pool must be located on a root-squash NFS mount.
