Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw in the integrated web server of Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPUs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF (CWE-352): The web server of the affected PLC does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a victim user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to perform actions with the permissions of a logged-in victim user. This could include configuration changes, process manipulation, or other functions available via the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and remote.
- The attacker needs to induce a victim user with an active session to trigger a malicious request. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    - Embedding the malicious request within a webpage, link, or email.
    - Social engineering tactics to trick the user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the PLC web server.
- The attacker must have knowledge of how to craft valid requests and parameters of the web interface.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate, only to make use of an authenticated user's session.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the integrated web server which operates on ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP.
- The provided documents specify that the vulnerability exists in all SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family versions prior to V4.1.3.
- Siemens has released firmware update V4.1.3 to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 8.8, with vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 6.8, with vector string AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ralf Spenneberg, Hendrik Schwartke, and Maik Br√ºggemann from OpenSource Training. Artem Zinenko from Kaspersky pointed out that SIPLUS devices were also affected.
