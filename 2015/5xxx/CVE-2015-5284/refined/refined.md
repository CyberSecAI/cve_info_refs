Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `ipa-kra-install` script, used to configure the Key Recovery Authority (KRA) subsystem in FreeIPA, was exporting the CA agent certificate and private key to a file (`/etc/httpd/alias/kra-agent.pem`) with world-readable permissions. This file is used for the KRA agent to authenticate with the KRA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability was the creation of the `kra-agent.pem` file with overly permissive file permissions (world-readable), allowing any user on the IPA server to access the certificate and private key.
- **Shared Credentials:** The KRA agent was using the same certificate and private key as the CA agent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Certificate Issuance:** An attacker gaining access to the `kra-agent.pem` file could use the included private key to impersonate the IPA CA agent and issue arbitrary certificates within the IPA domain, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the IPA infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the IPA server. An attacker would need to have an account on the server to read the file.
- **File Access:** An attacker would need to directly access the `kra-agent.pem` file on the server's filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker would require a valid user account on the IPA server where the vulnerable `ipa-kra-install` script had been run.
- **File System Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the file system and read files.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was fixed by modifying the install scripts to set the correct permissions on the `kra-agent.pem` file, specifically setting it to be readable only by the `apache` user and group.
*   The fix also includes a change to the upgrade procedure to ensure existing installations also have the permissions fixed.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in IPA 4.2, and does not affect versions of IPA shipped with RHEL 6 and 7.
