This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime. This is also the final update release for major version 9.0. Security Fixes  Two security issues have been fixed in this release which affect users of specific PostgreSQL features:  [...]  CVE-2015-5288: The crypt() function included with the optional pgCrypto extension could be exploited to read a few additional bytes of memory. No working exploit for this issue has been developed.  Details from <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/>  CVE-2015-5288 Affected versions: 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0 Fixed in: 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19, 9.0.23 Component: contrib module Class: C (A vulnerabilty that is exploitable for privilege escalation, but requiring a valid prior login.)

# E.22. Release 9.4.5

**Release date:** 2015-10-08

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.4.4. For information about new features in the 9.4 major release, see [Section E.27](release-9-4.html).

## E.22.1. Migration to Version 9.4.5

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.4.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.4.4, see [Section E.23](release-9-4-4.html).

## E.22.2. Changes

* Guard against stack overflows in json parsing (Oskari Saarenmaa)

  If an application constructs PostgreSQL json or jsonb values from arbitrary user input, the application's users can reliably crash the PostgreSQL server, causing momentary denial of service. (CVE-2015-5289)
* Fix contrib/pgcrypto to detect and report too-short `crypt()` salts (Josh Kupershmidt)

  Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few bytes of server memory. We have not ruled out the viability of attacks that arrange for presence of confidential information in the disclosed bytes, but they seem unlikely. (CVE-2015-5288)
* Fix subtransaction cleanup after a portal (cursor) belonging to an outer subtransaction fails (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  A function executed in an outer-subtransaction cursor could cause an assertion failure or crash by referencing a relation created within an inner subtransaction.
* Fix possible deadlock during WAL insertion when commit\_delay is set (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Ensure all relations referred to by an updatable view are properly locked during an update statement (Dean Rasheed)
* Fix insertion of relations into the relation cache "init file" (Tom Lane)

  An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases caused pg\_trigger\_tgrelid\_tgname\_index to be omitted from the init file. Subsequent sessions detected this, then deemed the init file to be broken and silently ignored it, resulting in a significant degradation in session startup time. In addition to fixing the bug, install some guards so that any similar future mistake will be more obvious.
* Avoid O(N^2) behavior when inserting many tuples into a SPI query result (Neil Conway)
* Improve LISTEN startup time when there are many unread notifications (Matt Newell)
* Fix performance problem when a session alters large numbers of foreign key constraints (Jan Wieck, Tom Lane)

  This was seen primarily when restoring pg\_dump output for databases with many thousands of tables.
* Disable SSL renegotiation by default (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)

  While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have seen too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL library and in our usage of it. Renegotiation will be removed entirely in 9.5 and later. In the older branches, just change the default value of ssl\_renegotiation\_limit to zero (disabled).
* Lower the minimum values of the \*\_freeze\_max\_age parameters (Andres Freund)

  This is mainly to make tests of related behavior less time-consuming, but it may also be of value for installations with limited disk space.
* Limit the maximum value of wal\_buffers to 2GB to avoid server crashes (Josh Berkus)
* Avoid logging complaints when a parameter that can only be set at server start appears multiple times in postgresql.conf, and fix counting of line numbers after an include\_dir directive (Tom Lane)
* Fix rare internal overflow in multiplication of numeric values (Dean Rasheed)
* Guard against hard-to-reach stack overflows involving record types, range types, json, jsonb, tsquery, ltxtquery and query\_int (Noah Misch)
* Fix handling of DOW and DOY in datetime input (Greg Stark)

  These tokens aren't meant to be used in datetime values, but previously they resulted in opaque internal error messages rather than "invalid input syntax".
* Add more query-cancel checks to regular expression matching (Tom Lane)
* Add recursion depth protections to regular expression, SIMILAR TO, and LIKE matching (Tom Lane)

  Suitable search patterns and a low stack depth limit could lead to stack-overrun crashes.
* Fix potential infinite loop in regular expression execution (Tom Lane)

  A search pattern that can apparently match a zero-length string, but actually doesn't match because of a back reference, could lead to an infinite loop.
* In regular expression execution, correctly record match data for capturing parentheses within a quantifier even when the match is zero-length (Tom Lane)
* Fix low-memory failures in regular expression compilation (Andreas Seltenreich)
* Fix low-probability memory leak during regular expression execution (Tom Lane)
* Fix rare low-memory failure in lock cleanup during transaction abort (Tom Lane)
* Fix "unexpected out-of-memory situation during sort" errors when using tuplestores with small work\_mem settings (Tom Lane)
* Fix very-low-probability stack overrun in `qsort` (Tom Lane)
* Fix "invalid memory alloc request size" failure in hash joins with large work\_mem settings (Tomas Vondra, Tom Lane)
* Fix assorted planner bugs (Tom Lane)

  These mistakes could lead to incorrect query plans that would give wrong answers, or to assertion failures in assert-enabled builds, or to odd planner errors such as "could not devise a query plan for the given query", "could not find pathkey item to sort", "plan should not reference subplan's variable", or "failed to assign all NestLoopParams to plan nodes". Thanks are due to Andreas Seltenreich and Piotr Stefaniak for fuzz testing that exposed these problems.
* Improve planner's performance for UPDATE/DELETE on large inheritance sets (Tom Lane, Dean Rasheed)
* Ensure standby promotion trigger files are removed at postmaster startup (Michael Paquier, Fujii Masao)

  This prevents unwanted promotion from occurring if these files appear in a database backup that is used to initialize a new standby server.
* During postmaster shutdown, ensure that per-socket lock files are removed and listen sockets are closed before we remove the postmaster.pid file (Tom Lane)

  This avoids race-condition failures if an external script attempts to start a new postmaster as soon as pg\_ctl stop returns.
* Ensure that the postmaster does not exit until all its child processes are gone, even in an immediate shutdown (Tom Lane)

  Like the previous item, this avoids possible race conditions against a subsequently-started postmaster.
* Fix postmaster's handling of a startup-process crash during crash recovery (Tom Lane)

  If, during a crash recovery cycle, the startup process crashes without having restored database consistency, we'd try to launch a new startup process, which typically would just crash again, leading to an infinite loop.
* Make emergency autovacuuming for multixact wraparound more robust (Andres Freund)
* Do not print a WARNING when an autovacuum worker is already gone when we attempt to signal it, and reduce log verbosity for such signals (Tom Lane)
* Prevent autovacuum launcher from sleeping unduly long if the server clock is moved backwards a large amount (Álvaro Herrera)
* Ensure that cleanup of a GIN index's pending-insertions list is interruptable by cancel requests (Jeff Janes)
* Allow all-zeroes pages in GIN indexes to be reused (Heikki Linnakangas)

  Such a page might be left behind after a crash.
* Fix handling of all-zeroes pages in SP-GiST indexes (Heikki Linnakangas)

  VACUUM attempted to recycle such pages, but did so in a way that wasn't crash-safe.
* Fix off-by-one error that led to otherwise-harmless warnings about "apparent wraparound" in subtrans/multixact truncation (Thomas Munro)
* Fix misreporting of CONTINUE and MOVE statement types in PL/pgSQL's error context messages (Pavel Stehule, Tom Lane)
* Fix PL/Perl to handle non-ASCII error message texts correctly (Alex Hunsaker)
* Fix PL/Python crash when returning the string representation of a record result (Tom Lane)
* Fix some places in PL/Tcl that neglected to check for failure of `malloc()` calls (Michael Paquier, Álvaro Herrera)
* In contrib/isn, fix output of ISBN-13 numbers that begin with 979 (Fabien Coelho)

  EANs beginning with 979 (but not 9790) are considered ISBNs, but they must be printed in the new 13-digit format, not the 10-digit format.
* Improve contrib/pg\_stat\_statements' handling of query-text garbage collection (Peter Geoghegan)

  The external file containing query texts could bloat to very large sizes; once it got past 1GB attempts to trim it would fail, soon leading to situations where the file could not be read at all.
* Improve contrib/postgres\_fdw's handling of collation-related decisions (Tom Lane)

  The main user-visible effect is expected to be that comparisons involving varchar columns will be sent to the remote server for execution in more cases than before.
* Improve libpq's handling of out-of-memory conditions (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)
* Fix memory leaks and missing out-of-memory checks in ecpg (Michael Paquier)
* Fix psql's code for locale-aware formatting of numeric output (Tom Lane)

  The formatting code invoked by \pset numericlocale on did the wrong thing for some uncommon cases such as numbers with an exponent but no decimal point. It could also mangle already-localized output from the money data type.
* Prevent crash in psql's \c command when there is no current connection (Noah Misch)
* Make pg\_dump handle inherited NOT VALID check constraints correctly (Tom Lane)
* Fix selection of default zlib compression level in pg\_dump's directory output format (Andrew Dunstan)
* Ensure that temporary files created during a pg\_dump run with tar-format output are not world-readable (Michael Paquier)
* Fix pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade to support cases where the postgres or template1 database is in a non-default tablespace (Marti Raudsepp, Bruce Momjian)
* Fix pg\_dump to handle object privileges sanely when dumping from a server too old to have a particular privilege type (Tom Lane)

  When dumping data types from pre-9.2 servers, and when dumping functions or procedural languages from pre-7.3 servers, pg\_dump would produce GRANT/REVOKE commands that revoked the owner's grantable privileges and instead granted all privileges to PUBLIC. Since the privileges involved are just USAGE and EXECUTE, this isn't a security problem, but it's certainly a surprising representation of the older systems' behavior. Fix it to leave the default privilege state alone in these cases.
* Fix pg\_dump to dump shell types (Tom Lane)

  Shell types (that is, not-yet-fully-defined types) aren't useful for much, but nonetheless pg\_dump should dump them.
* Fix assorted minor memory leaks in pg\_dump and other client-side programs (Michael Paquier)
* Fix pgbench's progress-report behavior when a query, or pgbench itself, gets stuck (Fabien Coelho)
* Fix spinlock assembly code for Alpha hardware (Tom Lane)
* Fix spinlock assembly code for PPC hardware to be compatible with AIX's native assembler (Tom Lane)

  Building with gcc didn't work if gcc had been configured to use the native assembler, which is becoming more common.
* On AIX, test the -qlonglong compiler option rather than just assuming it's safe to use (Noah Misch)
* On AIX, use -Wl,-brtllib link option to allow symbols to be resolved at runtime (Noah Misch)

  Perl relies on this ability in 5.8.0 and later.
* Avoid use of inline functions when compiling with 32-bit xlc, due to compiler bugs (Noah Misch)
* Use librt for `sched_yield()` when necessary, which it is on some Solaris versions (Oskari Saarenmaa)
* Translate encoding UHC as Windows code page 949 (Noah Misch)

  This fixes presentation of non-ASCII log messages from processes that are not attached to any particular database, such as the postmaster.
* On Windows, avoid failure when doing encoding conversion to UTF16 outside a transaction, such as for log messages (Noah Misch)
* Fix postmaster startup failure due to not copying `setlocale()`'s return value (Noah Misch)

  This has been reported on Windows systems with the ANSI code page set to CP936 ("Chinese (Simplified, PRC)"), and may occur with other multibyte code pages.
* Fix Windows install.bat script to handle target directory names that contain spaces (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Make the numeric form of the PostgreSQL version number (e.g., 90405) readily available to extension Makefiles, as a variable named VERSION\_NUM (Michael Paquier)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2015g for DST law changes in Cayman Islands, Fiji, Moldova, Morocco, Norfolk Island, North Korea, Turkey, and Uruguay. There is a new zone name America/Fort\_Nelson for the Canadian Northern Rockies.

# 2015-10-08 Security Update Release

Posted on **2015-10-08** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19 and 9.0.23. This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime. This is also the final update release for major version 9.0.

## Security Fixes

Two security issues have been fixed in this release which affect users of specific PostgreSQL features:

**CVE-2015-5289**: json or jsonb input values constructed from arbitrary user input can crash the PostgreSQL server and cause a denial of service.

**CVE-2015-5288**: The crypt() function included with the optional pgCrypto extension could be exploited to read a few additional bytes of memory. No working exploit for this issue has been developed.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Josh Kupershmidt and Oskari Saarenmaa for reporting these issues.

This update will also disable SSL renegotiation by default; previously, it was enabled by default. SSL renegotiation will be removed entirely in PostgreSQL versions 9.5 and later.

## Other Fixes and Improvements

In addition to the above, many other issues were patched in this release based on bugs reported by our users over the last few months. These fixes include:

* Prevent deeply nested regex, LIKE and SIMILAR matching from crashing the server
* Multiple other fixes with regular expression handling
* Ensure that ALTER TABLE sets all locks for CONSTRAINT modifications
* Fix subtransaction cleanup when a cursor fails, preventing a crash
* Prevent deadlock during WAL insertion when commit\_delay is set
* Fix locking during updating of updatable views
* Prevent corruption of relation cache "init file"
* Improve performance of large SPI query results
* Improve LISTEN startup time
* Disable SSL renegotiation by default
* Lower minimum for \*\_freeze\_max\_age parameters
* Limit the maximum for wal\_buffers to 2GB
* Guard against potential stack overflows in several areas
* Fix handling of DOW and DOY in datetime input
* Allow regular expression queries to be canceled sooner
* Fix assorted planner bugs
* Fix several shutdown issues in the postmaster
* Make anti-wraparound autovacuuming more robust
* Fix minor issues with GIN and SP-GiST indexes.
* Fix several issues with PL/Python, PL/Perl and PL/Tcl
* Improve pg\_stat\_statements' garbage collection
* Improve collation handling in pgsql\_fdw
* Improve libpq's handling of out-of-memory conditions
* Prevent psql crash when there is no current connection
* Multiple fixes to pg\_dump, including file and object permissions
* Improve handling of privileges when dumping from old PostgreSQL versions
* Fix issues with support of Alpha, PPC, AIX and Solaris platforms
* Fix startup issue on Windows with Chinese locale
* Fix Windows install.bat script to handle spaces in filenames
* Make the numeric PostgreSQL version number available to extensions

This update also contains tzdata release 2015g, with updates for Cayman Islands, Fiji, Moldova, Morocco, Norfolk Island, North Korea, Turkey, Uruguay, and the new zone America/Fort\_Nelson.

## Final Update for 9.0

9.0.23 is the final update for major version 9.0, which is now End-Of-Life (EOL) as scheduled. Future security updates will not include version 9.0. As such, users of that version should plan to upgrade to another major version as soon as possible. For more information about the community's support policy and EOL schedule, see the [Versioning Policy](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

## Updating

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries. Users who have skipped multiple update releases may need to perform additional post-update steps; see the Release Notes for details.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Details

Josh Kupershmidt discovered the pgCrypto extension could expose

several bytes of server memory if the crypt() function was provided a

too-short salt. An attacker could use this flaw to read private data.

([CVE-2015-5288](/security/CVE-2015-5288))

Oskari Saarenmaa discovered that the json and jsonb handlers could exhaust

available stack space. An attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial

of service attack. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

15.04. ([CVE-2015-5289](/security/CVE-2015-5289))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [postgresql-9.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.4)
  -
  [9.4.5-0ubuntu0.15.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.4/9.4.5-0ubuntu0.15.04)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [postgresql-9.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.3)
  -
  [9.3.10-0ubuntu0.14.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.3/9.3.10-0ubuntu0.14.04)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [postgresql-9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.1)
  -
  [9.1.19-0ubuntu0.12.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.1/9.1.19-0ubuntu0.12.04)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart PostgreSQL to

make all the necessary changes.

This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime. This is also the final update release for major version 9.0. Security Fixes  Two security issues have been fixed in this release which affect users of specific PostgreSQL features:  CVE-2015-5289: json or jsonb input values constructed from arbitrary user input can crash the PostgreSQL server and cause a denial of service.  [...]  Details from <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/>  CVE-2015-5289 Affected versions: 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0 Fixed in: 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19, 9.0.23 Component: core server Class: D (A vulnerability that is exploitable for denial-of-service, but requiring a valid prior login.)

Treat as recursive any such function that looks up and calls > the same-purpose function for a record column type or the range subtype. > Back-patch to 9.0 (all supported versions). >  > An array type's element type is never itself an array type, so array > functions are unaffected.  Recursion depth proportional to array > dimensionality, found in array_dim_to_jsonb(), is fine thanks to MAXDIM.  <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=5976097c0fce03f8cc201aefc4445ad57e09bb75>  > Prevent stack overflow in query-type functions. >  > The tsquery, ltxtquery and query_int data types have a common ancestor. > Having acquired check_stack_depth() calls independently, each was > missing at least one call.

# E.16. Release 9.3.10

**Release date:** 2015-10-08

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.3.9. For
information about new features in the 9.3 major release, see
[Section E.26](release-9-3.html).

## E.16.1. Migration to Version 9.3.10

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.3.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.3.9,
see [Section E.17](release-9-3-9.html).

## E.16.2. Changes

* Guard against stack overflows in json
  parsing (Oskari Saarenmaa)

  If an application constructs PostgreSQL json or jsonb values from
  arbitrary user input, the application's users can reliably crash
  the PostgreSQL server, causing momentary denial of service.
  (CVE-2015-5289)
* Fix contrib/pgcrypto to detect and
  report too-short `crypt()` salts (Josh
  Kupershmidt)

  Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a
  few bytes of server memory. We have not ruled out the viability of
  attacks that arrange for presence of confidential information in
  the disclosed bytes, but they seem unlikely. (CVE-2015-5288)
* Fix subtransaction cleanup after a portal (cursor) belonging to
  an outer subtransaction fails (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  A function executed in an outer-subtransaction cursor could
  cause an assertion failure or crash by referencing a relation
  created within an inner subtransaction.
* Ensure all relations referred to by an updatable view are
  properly locked during an update statement (Dean Rasheed)
* Fix insertion of relations into the relation cache "init file" (Tom Lane)

  An oversight in a patch in the most recent minor releases caused
  pg\_trigger\_tgrelid\_tgname\_index to be
  omitted from the init file. Subsequent sessions detected this, then
  deemed the init file to be broken and silently ignored it,
  resulting in a significant degradation in session startup time. In
  addition to fixing the bug, install some guards so that any similar
  future mistake will be more obvious.
* Avoid O(N^2) behavior when inserting many tuples into a SPI
  query result (Neil Conway)
* Improve LISTEN startup time when there
  are many unread notifications (Matt Newell)
* Fix performance problem when a session alters large numbers of
  foreign key constraints (Jan Wieck, Tom Lane)

  This was seen primarily when restoring pg\_dump output for databases with many
  thousands of tables.
* Disable SSL renegotiation by default (Michael Paquier, Andres
  Freund)

  While use of SSL renegotiation is a good idea in theory, we have
  seen too many bugs in practice, both in the underlying OpenSSL
  library and in our usage of it. Renegotiation will be removed
  entirely in 9.5 and later. In the older branches, just change the
  default value of ssl\_renegotiation\_limit
  to zero (disabled).
* Lower the minimum values of the \*\_freeze\_max\_age parameters (Andres Freund)

  This is mainly to make tests of related behavior less
  time-consuming, but it may also be of value for installations with
  limited disk space.
* Limit the maximum value of wal\_buffers
  to 2GB to avoid server crashes (Josh Berkus)
* Avoid logging complaints when a parameter that can only be set
  at server start appears multiple times in postgresql.conf, and fix counting of line numbers
  after an include\_dir directive (Tom
  Lane)
* Fix rare internal overflow in multiplication of numeric values (Dean Rasheed)
* Guard against hard-to-reach stack overflows involving record
  types, range types, json, jsonb, tsquery, ltxtquery and query\_int (Noah
  Misch)
* Fix handling of DOW and DOY in datetime input (Greg Stark)

  These tokens aren't meant to be used in datetime values, but
  previously they resulted in opaque internal error messages rather
  than "invalid input syntax".
* Add more query-cancel checks to regular expression matching (Tom
  Lane)
* Add recursion depth protections to regular expression,
  SIMILAR TO, and LIKE matching (Tom Lane)

  Suitable search patterns and a low stack depth limit could lead
  to stack-overrun crashes.
* Fix potential infinite loop in regular expression execution (Tom
  Lane)

  A search pattern that can apparently match a zero-length string,
  but actually doesn't match because of a back reference, could lead
  to an infinite loop.
* In regular expression execution, correctly record match data for
  capturing parentheses within a quantifier even when the match is
  zero-length (Tom Lane)
* Fix low-memory failures in regular expression compilation
  (Andreas Seltenreich)
* Fix low-probability memory leak during regular expression
  execution (Tom Lane)
* Fix rare low-memory failure in lock cleanup during transaction
  abort (Tom Lane)
* Fix "unexpected out-of-memory situation
  during sort" errors when using tuplestores with small
  work\_mem settings (Tom Lane)
* Fix very-low-probability stack overrun in `qsort` (Tom Lane)
* Fix "invalid memory alloc request
  size" failure in hash joins with large work\_mem settings (Tomas Vondra, Tom Lane)
* Fix assorted planner bugs (Tom Lane)

  These mistakes could lead to incorrect query plans that would
  give wrong answers, or to assertion failures in assert-enabled
  builds, or to odd planner errors such as "could
  not devise a query plan for the given query", "could not find pathkey item to sort", "plan should not reference subplan's variable", or
  "failed to assign all NestLoopParams to plan
  nodes". Thanks are due to Andreas Seltenreich and Piotr
  Stefaniak for fuzz testing that exposed these problems.
* Improve planner's performance for UPDATE/DELETE on large
  inheritance sets (Tom Lane, Dean Rasheed)
* Ensure standby promotion trigger files are removed at postmaster
  startup (Michael Paquier, Fujii Masao)

  This prevents unwanted promotion from occurring if these files
  appear in a database backup that is used to initialize a new
  standby server.
* During postmaster shutdown, ensure that per-socket lock files
  are removed and listen sockets are closed before we remove the
  postmaster.pid file (Tom Lane)

  This avoids race-condition failures if an external script
  attempts to start a new postmaster as soon as pg\_ctl stop returns.
* Fix postmaster's handling of a startup-process crash during
  crash recovery (Tom Lane)

  If, during a crash recovery cycle, the startup process crashes
  without having restored database consistency, we'd try to launch a
  new startup process, which typically would just crash again,
  leading to an infinite loop.
* Make emergency autovacuuming for multixact wraparound more
  robust (Andres Freund)
* Do not print a WARNING when an
  autovacuum worker is already gone when we attempt to signal it, and
  reduce log verbosity for such signals (Tom Lane)
* Prevent autovacuum launcher from sleeping unduly long if the
  server clock is moved backwards a large amount (Álvaro Herrera)
* Ensure that cleanup of a GIN index's pending-insertions list is
  interruptable by cancel requests (Jeff Janes)
* Allow all-zeroes pages in GIN indexes to be reused (Heikki
  Linnakangas)

  Such a page might be left behind after a crash.
* Fix handling of all-zeroes pages in SP-GiST indexes (Heikki
  Linnakangas)

  VACUUM attempted to recycle such pages,
  but did so in a way that wasn't crash-safe.
* Fix off-by-one error that led to otherwise-harmless warnings
  about "apparent wraparound" in
  subtrans/multixact truncation (Thomas Munro)
* Fix misreporting of CONTINUE and
  MOVE statement types in PL/pgSQL's error context messages (Pavel
  Stehule, Tom Lane)
* Fix PL/Perl to handle
  non-ASCII error message texts
  correctly (Alex Hunsaker)
* Fix PL/Python crash when
  returning the string representation of a record result (Tom Lane)
* Fix some places in PL/Tcl that
  neglected to check for failure of `malloc()` calls (Michael Paquier, Álvaro
  Herrera)
* In contrib/isn, fix output of ISBN-13
  numbers that begin with 979 (Fabien Coelho)

  EANs beginning with 979 (but not 9790) are considered ISBNs, but
  they must be printed in the new 13-digit format, not the 10-digit
  format.
* Improve contrib/postgres\_fdw's
  handling of collation-related decisions (Tom Lane)

  The main user-visible effect is expected to be that comparisons
  involving varchar columns will be sent to the
  remote server for execution in more cases than before.
* Improve libpq's handling of
  out-of-memory conditions (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)
* Fix memory leaks and missing out-of-memory checks in
  ecpg (Michael Paquier)
* Fix psql's code for
  locale-aware formatting of numeric output (Tom Lane)

  The formatting code invoked by \pset
  numericlocale on did the wrong thing for some uncommon cases
  such as numbers with an exponent but no decimal point. It could
  also mangle already-localized output from the money data type.
* Prevent crash in psql's
  \c command when there is no current
  connection (Noah Misch)
* Make pg\_dump handle inherited
  NOT VALID check constraints correctly (Tom
  Lane)
* Fix selection of default zlib
  compression level in pg\_dump's
  directory output format (Andrew Dunstan)
* Ensure that temporary files created during a pg\_dump run with tar-format output are not world-readable
  (Michael Paquier)
* Fix pg\_dump and pg\_upgrade to support cases where the
  postgres or template1 database is in a non-default tablespace
  (Marti Raudsepp, Bruce Momjian)
* Fix pg\_dump to handle object
  privileges sanely when dumping from a server too old to have a
  particular privilege type (Tom Lane)

  When dumping data types from pre-9.2 servers, and when dumping
  functions or procedural languages from pre-7.3 servers,
  pg\_dump would produce GRANT/REVOKE commands that
  revoked the owner's grantable privileges and instead granted all
  privileges to PUBLIC. Since the privileges
  involved are just USAGE and EXECUTE, this isn't a security problem, but it's
  certainly a surprising representation of the older systems'
  behavior. Fix it to leave the default privilege state alone in
  these cases.
* Fix pg\_dump to dump shell types
  (Tom Lane)

  Shell types (that is, not-yet-fully-defined types) aren't useful
  for much, but nonetheless pg\_dump
  should dump them.
* Fix assorted minor memory leaks in pg\_dump and other client-side programs
  (Michael Paquier)
* Fix spinlock assembly code for PPC hardware to be compatible
  with AIX's native assembler (Tom
  Lane)

  Building with gcc didn't work
  if gcc had been configured to use
  the native assembler, which is becoming more common.
* On AIX, test the -qlonglong compiler option rather than just assuming
  it's safe to use (Noah Misch)
* On AIX, use -Wl,-brtllib link option to allow symbols to be
  resolved at runtime (Noah Misch)

  Perl relies on this ability in 5.8.0 and later.
* Avoid use of inline functions when compiling with 32-bit
  xlc, due to compiler bugs (Noah
  Misch)
* Use librt for `sched_yield()` when necessary, which it is on some
  Solaris versions (Oskari Saarenmaa)
* Fix Windows install.bat script to
  handle target directory names that contain spaces (Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Make the numeric form of the PostgreSQL version number (e.g., 90405) readily available to extension Makefiles, as
  a variable named VERSION\_NUM (Michael
  Paquier)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2015g for DST law changes in
  Cayman Islands, Fiji, Moldova, Morocco, Norfolk Island, North
  Korea, Turkey, and Uruguay. There is a new zone name America/Fort\_Nelson for the Canadian Northern
  Rockies.
