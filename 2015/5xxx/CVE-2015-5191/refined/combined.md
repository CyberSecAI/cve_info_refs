##### 1. Summary

VMware vCenter Server and Tools updates resolve multiple security vulnerabilities

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware vCenter Server
* VMware Tools

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. Insecure library loading through LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**

VMware vCenter Server contains an insecure library loading issue that occurs due to the use of **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH** variable in an unsafe manner. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow unprivileged host users to load a shared library that may lead to privilege escalation.

**Note:** In order to exploit this issue an attacker should be able to trick the admin to execute wrapper scripts from a world writable directory.

VMware would like to thank Thorsten Tüllmann, researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-4921 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. Information disclosure via service startup script**

VMware vCenter Server contains an information disclosure issue due to the service startup script using world writable directories as temporary storage for critical information. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow unprivileged host users to access certain critical information when the service gets restarted.

VMware would like to thank Thorsten Tüllmann, researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-4922 to this issue.

**c. Information disclosure via vCenter Server Appliance file-based backup feature**

**d. Local privilege escalation in VMware Tools**

VMware Tools contains multiple file system races in libDeployPkg, related to the use of hard-coded paths under /tmp. Successful exploitation of this issue may result in a local privilege escalation.

VMware would like to thank Florian Weimer and Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security for reporting this issue to us.
