{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `general_composite_rect()` function of pixman.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The function allocates a fixed-size buffer on the stack and calculates `src_buffer` and `dest_buffer` based on the buffer's address and the `width`. When width is large, adding `width * Bpp` (bytes per pixel) to the buffer address can cause an integer overflow. This leads to the check that determines whether to fall back to heap allocation to fail, as the calculated address becomes numerically smaller than the base address.",
      "This can result in out-of-bounds memory access."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this issue to cause an application using pixman to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a specific width value in a call to `general_composite_rect()`, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the width parameter passed to the `general_composite_rect()` function through an application using pixman.",
    "more_info": "The bug was identified using a stress test that caused a segfault. It was found that the root cause was an integer overflow during pointer arithmetic when calculating buffer addresses on the stack. The issue was triggered in 32-bit systems. The fix was released in pixman version 0.32.8."
