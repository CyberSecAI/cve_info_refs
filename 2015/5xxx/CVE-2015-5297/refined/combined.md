The uninitialized value alarm is a known quirk, explained here with more details: <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2013-December/003164.html> Using memset is not desired in the performance critical part of code, so we would want a better solution. Relying on TLS (as mentioned in the mailing list) is not a very good option either because we also have to support weird operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows. See [bug #34842](show_bug.cgi?id=34842 "RESOLVED MOVED - Memory Leaks (on Windows operating system)") In any case, it is very unlikely to be related to your segfault. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=92027#c5)  Siarhei Siamashka    2015-09-19 22:11:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ludovic Courtès from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=92027#c1)) > I can provide instructions on how to reproduce it using GNU Guix.  I tried to install GCC 4.9.3, but still can't reproduce the problem. Additional information would be appreciated.  Also please try "--disable-openmp" configure option (so that we don't need "OMP_NUM_THREADS=1") and also "--disable-gtk --disable-libpng --disable-shared --enable-static-testprogs" as an additional experiment. Removing OpenMP and libtool out of the way may make debugging easier. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=92027#c6)  Ludovic Courtès    2015-09-21 13:30:45 UTC  ``` (The trick to deterministically reproduce the issue was to turn off ASLR either in GDB or with 'setarch -R', which is what Guix's build daemon does.)  After some more debugging, I found what seems to be the root cause.  'general_composite_rect' allocates a fixed-size buffer on the stack and then computes 'src_buffer' and 'dest_buffer' as a function of that buffer's address and 'width'.  The problem is that the buffer address is typically high (since it's on the stack), so for high values of 'width', adding 'width * Bpp' to that address can overflow.  Thus, the test to determine whether to fall back to heap allocation:      if (ALIGN (dest_buffer + width * Bpp) > 	    scanline_buffer + sizeof (stack_scanline_buffer))  will just fail, because 'dest_buffer + width * Bpp' is numerically smaller than 'scanline_buffer'.  Here's an example GDB session:  (gdb) p dest_buffer $1 = (uint8_t *) 0xd0f0 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0xd0f0> (gdb) p src_buffer $2 = (uint8_t *) 0xffff6150 "" (gdb) p mask_buffer $3 = (uint8_t *) 0x1920 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x1920> (gdb) p src_buffer $4 = (uint8_t *) 0xffff6150 "" (gdb) p width $5 = 11764 (gdb) p src_buffer + width $6 = (uint8_t *) 0xffff8f44 "" (gdb) p Bpp $7 = <optimized out> (gdb) p src_buffer + width*16 $8 = (uint8_t *) 0x24090 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x24090> (gdb) p mask_buffer $9 = (uint8_t *) 0x1920 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x1920> (gdb) p src_buffer + width*8 $10 = (uint8_t *) 0xd0f0 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0xd0f0> (gdb) p src_buffer + width*4 $11 = (uint8_t *) 0x1920 <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x1920> (gdb) p scanline_buffer $12 = (uint8_t *) 0xffff6150 "" (gdb) p src_buffer $13 = (uint8_t *) 0xffff6150 "" (gdb) p width $14 = 11764  I'm attaching a patch which I think solves the issue correctly.  Please let me know what you think. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=92027#c7)  Ludovic Courtès    2015-09-21 13:33:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118382](attachment.cgi?id=118382 "Avoid numerical overflow in pointer arithmetic.")

This looks like a rather important bugfix. Please send your patch to the pixman mailing list for review: <http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/pixman>  Though based on a quick look, the first revision of the patch does not seem to be entirely correct because the ALIGN macro is not fully accounted for. This macro ensures 16 bytes alignment, which is needed for SIMD optimized code. And using just (width + 1) is not sufficient for this.  Also this whole part of code may need to rewritten a bit, because calculating addresses beyond the array bounds even without dereferencing them is a bad idea: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/988158/take-the-address-of-a-one-past-the-end-array-element-via-subscript-legal-by-the> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=92027#c9)  Oded Gabbay    2015-09-22 10:25:54 UTC  ``` Patch that fixes this problem was pushed to master and to 0.32 branch.
