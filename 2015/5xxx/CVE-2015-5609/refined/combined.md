Description: Image Export plugin can help you selectively download images uploaded by an administrator .
Vulnerability:
The code in file download.php doesn't do any checking that the user is requesting files from the uploaded images directory only.  And line 8 attempts to
unlink the file after being downloaded.  This script could be used to delete files out of the wordpress directory if file permissions allow.

      1 <?php
      2 if ( isset( $_REQUEST['file'] ) && !empty( $_REQUEST['file'] ) ) {
      3         $file = $_GET['file'];
      4
      5         header( 'Content-Type: application/zip' );
      6         header( 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $file . '"' );
      7         readfile( $file );
      8         unlink( $file );
      9
     10         exit;

Our interpretation is that there is only one security problem. The
download.php script should only be operating on ZIP files created by
the image-export.php script (see the
<http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/image-export/trunk/> directory), but
does not enforce that in any way. The latter script has
"define( 'DOWNLOAD_PATH', dirname( __FILE__ ) );" near the top. There
doesn't seem to be any evidence that either reading other files in the
DOWNLOAD_PATH directory, or deleting other files in the DOWNLOAD_PATH
directory, is supported behavior. This is not necessarily about
directory traversal. The only file that should be either read or
deleted is an images*.zip file. Deleting this file is apparently
intentional because there's no need to continue storing both the
individual files and the ZIP archive.

We don't think there should be two CVE IDs based on an argument such
as "reading files is probably important only with directory traversal,
but deleting files is probably important even without directory
traversal."

Use CVE-2015-5609 for the vulnerability in which download.php proceeds
with readfile and unlink without verifying that the pathname is
image-export's own pathname for its own ZIP file.
