Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `download.php` file of the "image-export" WordPress plugin. The script directly uses user-supplied input (`$_GET['file']`) without any validation or sanitization to construct the file path for both downloading and deleting. This lack of input validation allows for arbitrary file download and deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The `readfile()` function reads and outputs the content of the file specified by the user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to download any file accessible by the web server.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `unlink()` function deletes the file specified by the user-supplied input after the download, enabling an attacker to delete arbitrary files if the webserver process has the necessary permissions to do so.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of any checks to ensure that the requested file is within the intended upload directory or is a legitimate ZIP file created by the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), database credentials, or other files containing sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) / Data Loss:** By deleting critical system files or plugin files via the `unlink()` function, an attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the WordPress site or cause data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script, providing the path to the file they want to download or delete through the `file` parameter. For example:
    `http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/image-export/download.php?file=/etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin repository.
*   The intended use of the `download.php` script was to only operate on ZIP files created by the `image-export.php` script, and then delete them. The vulnerability allows for reading and deleting arbitrary files on the server.
*   The CVE assignment team at MITRE determined that both the arbitrary file reading and deleting vulnerabilities should be covered by one CVE ID (CVE-2015-5609), as they stem from the same root cause (lack of input validation).
