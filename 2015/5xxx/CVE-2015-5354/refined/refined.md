Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the insufficient input validation and sanitization within the Novius-OS CMS application. This allows for the injection of malicious code through several parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied data, specifically within 'media\_title' and 'menu\_title' fields, is not properly sanitized. These fields store data in the MySQL database, and the stored payloads execute each time the data is accessed, resulting in persistent XSS.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `tab` parameter in the admin panel is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Open Redirect:** The `redirect` parameter in the login page is not properly validated, which makes it possible for an attacker to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or the execution of further malicious actions within the context of the user.
*   **LFI:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files on the server's file system, which could include configuration files, source code, or database credentials.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site, possibly tricking them into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript payloads via the 'media\_title' or 'menu\_title' fields in the Novius-OS admin panel.
*   **LFI:** Attackers manipulate the `tab` parameter in the admin interface with directory traversal sequences to access files outside the webroot.
*   **Open Redirect:** Attackers craft a URL with the `redirect` parameter pointing to a malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of Novius-OS.
*   **LFI:** The attacker needs to access the admin panel.
*   **Open Redirect:** The attacker can trick a user via a crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Novius-OS version 5.0.1-elche.
*   The XSS is persistent, meaning the malicious payload is stored in the database and executed each time the injected data is rendered.
*   The XSS payload is not sanitized in the `h1` tag but is in the title tag.
*   The exploit details include specific URLs and vulnerable parameters, demonstrating how to trigger each vulnerability.
* The advisory states that both GET and POST requests can be used to trigger the vulnerabilities.
