# JVN#62078684 ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX control vulnerable to buffer overflow

## Overview

ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX control

## Description

ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX control was used for "Click to Live" service provided by FreeBit Co., Ltd. Although "Click to Live" service has been discontinued, PCs that used the "Click to Live" service may still have the ActiveX control installed.

ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX control, which is provided by the file c2lv6.ocx, contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ExecCall() method.

## Impact

By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an HTML email attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

## Solution

**Delete the ELPhoneBtnV6**

"Click to Live" service has been discontinued. It is recommended to delete the ELPhoneBtnV6 ActiveX Control.

## Vendor Status

| Vendor | Status | Last Update | Vendor Notes |

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

This JVN publication was delayed to 2015/09/07 after the developer fix was developed. From the fiscal year 2011, JPCERT/CC is using a new vendor coordination procedure. This new procedure came from the recommendation of the fiscal year 2010 "Study Group on Information System Vulnerability Handling" aimed at more timely JVN publications.

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2015.09.07 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:6.8
