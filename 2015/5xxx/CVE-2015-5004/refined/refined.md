- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Edge Component Caching Proxy in IBM WebSphere Application Server uses weaker than expected security measures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for quicker decryption of information, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt information more quickly and obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network based, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:N`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker requires low privileges (`PR:L`) and the attack is complex to execute (`AC:H`), meaning they need some knowledge of the system to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is not required (`UI:N`). The scope is unchanged (`S:U`) and only confidentiality is impacted (`C:H, I:N, A:N`).
