Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability was caused by the `proxy.php` file in the "PayPal Currency Converter BASIC for WooCommerce" WordPress plugin. This file used `file_get_contents()` to fetch content based on the `requrl` parameter provided in the GET request. The fetched content was then processed and displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `proxy.php` file did not properly sanitize or validate the `requrl` parameter, which allowed an attacker to specify arbitrary local files on the server.
*   **Unrestricted URL Access:** The `file_get_contents()` function was used to fetch the content based on user provided URL without proper validation, which could potentially lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive File Disclosure:** An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or other application code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTTP GET request to `proxy.php`, including a `requrl` parameter pointing to a local file on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance. No authentication is required, as this vulnerability can be exploited anonymously.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit example demonstrates accessing `/etc/passwd` to read the contents of the password file.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involved removing `proxy.php` and associated functionality from the plugin, which indicates the flawed implementation was removed entirely instead of being patched.
*   The plugin version `<= 1.3` is vulnerable, and version `1.4` patched this issue.
