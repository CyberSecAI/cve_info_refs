2 Bugs ﬁxed since previous Public Release

This document provides a summary of bugﬁxes and changes that have been applied subsequently
to shipping Patch Release #2569.

38476 Default folders mixed up when migrating to RFC6154 compliant IMAP
RFC6154 describes ”special use” ﬂags for mailboxes. The IMAP implementation is able to deﬁne
a speciﬁc mailbox to be used as ”Sent”, ”Spam” etc. folders. OX AppSuite supports this standard
and adjusts the initial default folders accordingly. In case of a IMAP component being migrated to
a RFC6154 capable conﬁguration, default folders could change. When those folders were synchro-
nized to Outlook or a EAS client, a mismatch of client and server ”default” folders occurred which
led to issues using those kind of folders. For example, sent mail was not stored to the correspond-
ing default folder since the mapping got lost. We now propagate changes of those ”default” folders
to related clients. Existing mismatches will be corrected when accessing mailboxes, therefor it’s
possible that users experience changes to their default folders by this correction.

38553 Default folder icons for external accounts are not correctly displayed
When using a RFC6154 capable IMAP implementation, default folders for ”Sent”, ”Spam” etc. are
signalled. When adding external mail accounts, the proper mapping was introduced after a re-login
but not at the instant when adding the mail account. This has been solved by handling ”special use”
ﬂags when initially adding a mail account.

39069 Heavy database load when triggering contact autocomplete
Using multiple tokens when searching for contacts, a huge search query gets generated and ex-
ecuted. This leads to unnecessary database load when performing unusual search requests. To
avoid high system load and evade harmful behaviour, the amount of valid tokens has been limited
to 5.

39283 Documents created from templates are not saved in Drive
Documents created from templates are not saved in ’Drive’ if ’Drive’ is conﬁgured with Smartdrive.
Use (possible overridden) default folders from conﬁg tree in folder service.

38602 Propagated default folder name changes where not handled by USM
As a follow-up ﬁx for Bug #38476, USM has been modiﬁed to handle changes of default folders,
such as ”Sent”, ”Spam” etc. This enables Outlook or EAS clients to adapt to a change in default
folders.

Release Notes for Patch Release #2614

39485 CVE-2015-5375
CVSSv2: 5.7

37237 Error message while creating social accounts
No meaningful error message was displayed after creating a new social account without entering a
name.
This was ﬁxed by returning regular JSON instead of a HTML page. Now a meaningful message is
displayed.

37891 Cannot edit social accounts on IE 11
User wasnt able to edit existing social account with Internet Explorer 11.
This was ﬁxed by completely searching account array, to be able to edit social accounts again.

38030 Sent folder not always synchronized
Sometimes emails in Sent folder are not up to date. No event was triggered when a sent message
was appended to standard sent folder.
This was ﬁxed by sending appropriate event for standard sent folder when appending sent mes-
sage. Now Sent folder synchronizing correctly.

38411 Mail folder list scrolls down
If an user had a lot of folders under inbox (not My folders), it was scroll down to the last entry after
re-login.
To make sure the current node appears in the viewport, the scrollIntoView was adjusted.

38601 Tasks: recurring date displayed as unknown
After editing an existing recurring appointment it was possible, that detail view shows: ”This task
recurs Monthly on the unknown day”.
This happend, because old values were not correctly deleted. Now this values are correctly deleted
and this issue is gone.

38605 Timeouts when creating users in a large context
Timeouts when checking the uniqueness of a display name for a large context.
This was ﬁxed by introducing separate method to OXUserInterface to retrieve only users’ display
names.

38822 Member in distribution list only displayed by email not name
Data of distribution list members is loaded dynamically from referenced contacts. In case a refer-
enced contacts has no display name, this was also applied for the distribution list member.
This has been ﬁxed by do not overwriting displayname of distribution list member if not set in ref-
erenced contact.

38851 Adding a Google or Yahoo account with Internet Explorer 11 shows only a blank page
In IE11 after adding a google or Yahoo account within settings, the user see only a white blank page
instead of the accounts.
Now after the account is created we request fresh data from the server, this ﬁx the IE11 issue.

38864 Save button of mail ﬁlter rules becomes unexpected grayed
Save button of mail ﬁlter rules becomes unexpected grayed. An incorrect detection of invalid ﬁlters
led to this error.
The incorrect detection has been ﬁxed and now the save button is no longer grayed out.

38886 Edit link displayed with no edit permissions in appointment
If an user create an appointment (not as owner of the folder) he can’t edit or delete it. This was
caused by a wrong permissions check in edit draw function.
This was solved by a new permission check.

Release Notes for Patch Release #2614

38890 CMD touch-appsuite needs to handle external timestamp argument
Frontend cluster setup and gui custom plugins needs to ensure that timestamps set by CMD touch-
appsuite are the same on all nodes. This ensure that no mistaken browser cache invalidation takes
place by loadbalancing and prevent on wasting resources.

39287 Email compose: wrong picture size
Picture size was accidentally set to a ﬁxed size.
This was ﬁxed by changing picture size to keep original size but at most the width of the editor.

3 Changes relevant for Administrators

3.1 Changes of Conﬁguration Files

holding

currently

”mailresolver.properties”

Change #2577 Conﬁgurable look-up mechanism for standard mail resolver
setting
Introduced
"com.openexchange.mailmapping.lookUpByDomain".Setting this option to ”true” means that the do-
main part of a mail address (the part after the ”@” sign) is used to ﬁnd a matching context by check-
ing the login mappings. That mechanism does only work if Open-Xchange setup strictly deﬁnes a
dedicated and unique domain per context. Otherwise that look-up mechanism will lead to wrong
results. Having a value of ”false” means that the mail address is going to be looked-up on a per
database schema basis. For each known schema a query is performed to check whether there is
such an internal user. Default is ”false”.
Moreover introduced ﬁle ’external-domains.properties’ which provides a list of such domains that
are supposed to be considered as external; meaning no domain look-up takes place and directly
signaled as a mail address of a non-internal user.

boolean

3.2 Changes of Command Line Tools

Change #2638 Additional timestamp parameter for touch-appsuite script
In order to deploy the same timestamp in a cluster-setup, the touch-appsuite needs an additional
parameter to manually set the timestamp to a uniﬁed value.
This change is completely compatible with earlier versions. It just adds the possibility to synchro-
nize the time-stamps in a cluster-setup.
Usage: touch-appsuite --timestamp=<value>

3.3 Changes of Packaging

Change #2485 Backend support for SAML authentication
The backend extension that provides SAML as authentication mechanism is introduced via optional
packages:
* A virtual package open-xchange-saml which depends on two other packages open-xchange-saml-core
and open-xchange-saml-backend.
* open-xchange-saml-core is provided by Open-Xchange as a binary package and contains a
new bundle com.openexchange.saml.
* open-xchange-saml-backend is environment-specific and needs to be provided by the operating
party.
To use SAML in production, extensive configuration as well as development efforts are needed.
An comprehensive integration guide will emerge at
http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=AppSuite:SAML SSO Integration.

It provides the general support for SAML authentication.

4 Tests

The Open-Xchange QA team has successfully veriﬁed all bug ﬁxes that could be reproduced within
a lab environment.

Release Notes for Patch Release #2614

To avoid side eﬀects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server setup for system and integration
testing.

All changes have been checked for potential side-eﬀects and eﬀect on behavior. Unless explicitly

stated within this document, we do not expect any side-eﬀects.
