Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5158:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `scsi_req_parse_cdb` function within the QEMU SCSI subsystem.
- The `scsi_cdb_length` function can return -1 as an error, but the caller `scsi_req_parse_cdb` doesn't check this value before using it as the length of the command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A negative length value is used in a memory allocation or copy operation, leading to a large out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The overflow can cause a SIGSEGV due to the massive memory write, crashing the QEMU process.
- Although the immediate impact is a crash, a more controlled buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing SCSI commands within a virtual machine.
- An attacker can send a specially crafted SCSI command to the virtual machine, which QEMU then attempts to process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the SCSI commands sent to the QEMU virtual machine. This would typically require a malicious guest VM or an attacker who has already gained some form of access to the host and/or hypervisor that allows them to craft and send malicious SCSI commands to the virtual machine.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted SCSI command that causes `scsi_cdb_length` to return -1.
