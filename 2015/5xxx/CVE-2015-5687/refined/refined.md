  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2015-5687",
    "description": "system/session/drivers/cookie.php in Anchor CMS 0.9.x allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted serialized object in a cookie.",
    "technicalDetails": {
      "rootCause": "The AnchorCMS cookie session driver uses `unserialize()` on user-provided data from a cookie without proper authentication.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "PHP Object Injection",
        "Insecure Deserialization",
        "Use of MD5 for authentication instead of a MAC",
	 "Weak PRNG used for security contexts"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious serialized object within a cookie.",
      "attackVectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP cookie containing a serialized PHP object.",
       "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with a malicious cookie. No prior authentication is required."
    },
     "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is due to the combination of using MD5 for authentication and `unserialize()` on user-provided data. The lack of a CSPRNG also contributes to weak security. The provided patch replaces the cookie session driver with one using HMAC-SHA-256, constant-time MAC comparison and a CSPRNG and includes a `Security` library with CSPRNG, `hash_equals()` polyfill, binary-safe string operations. The vulnerability could potentially be wormable."
