# AnchorCMS - PHP Object Injection (CVE-2015-5687) and More

---

*From*: Scott Arciszewski <scott () paragonie com>

*Date*: Thu, 27 Aug 2015 09:04:54 -0400

```
In the near future on an IRC server near you:

```
> ```
> <user1> Hey, what's the best command line tool for verifying that my copy of AnchorCMS 0.9.x is secure?
> <user2> rm
>
> ```

```

CVE-2015-5687 (PHP Object Injection in AnchorCMS)
=================================================

Out of the box, AnchorCMS defaults to store all session state in a
cookie (contrast this with only storing a unique identifier in a
cookie which references a server-side storage mechanism, such as a
temporary file or a database row).

Aside: If you have paid attention to my past work with Laravel,
CodeIgniter, and Kohana, you probably already know how this story
ends. This finding is so much worse than anything I've found in any of
those three.

Generally, when a framework or CMS decides to go down the "cookie
session driver" route, they do so knowing that end users have complete
control over the contents of the cookie. Fortunately, there's a
cryptographic tool that allows them to do this almost safely: a
Message Authentication Code.

The first mistake the AnchorCMS cookie session driver made was,
instead of using a MAC (e.g. hash_hmac('sha256', $cookie_data,
$some_key)), they just used an MD5 hash.

<https://github.com/paragonie/anchor-cms/blob/1207ab1b656bc5687bc2d2d6f57e6c4d0ca7d15f/system/session/drivers/cookie.php#L19-L35>

The second mistake the AnchorCMS cookie session driver made was the
same one almost every other cookie session driver ever written in PHP
makes: It uses unserialize() on user-provided data. Normally this
isn't exploitable, because a MAC cannot be forged without the
server-side authentication key or a timing side-channel on the MAC
verification. But as we just said, they just prepend an MD5 hash and
use that as an authentication mechanism.

Both mistakes, combined, make this a remotely exploitable PHP object
injection vulnerability. Combine that with some of the recent CVEs for
memory corruption in unserialize() and the fact that AnchorCMS
officially supports EOL'd versions of PHP which do not have these
memory corruptions fixed, we potentially have a wormable remote
exploit on any server running AnchorCMS on the Internet. Wonderful.

Weak PRNG used in security contexts
===================================

During the course of writing a patch to migrate the cookie session
driver to HMAC-SHA-256 with constant-time MAC comparison, we
discovered that they did not at any point expose or use a CSPRNG (not
even in the salt generation of their bcrypt implementation).

Instead, they relied on str_shuffle().

<https://github.com/paragonie/anchor-cms/blob/07933dbc7939326bb4973827a0934d1a610851d1/system/helpers.php#L55-L59>
<https://github.com/paragonie/anchor-cms/blob/66581e5969029e7b6dfddfe3326bb9f15f27b859/anchor/libraries/hash.php#L15>

We have not explored the full potential of the exploitability of this
issue (why brute force a 32-bit keyspace when you already have the
potential to get a remote shell?), but needless to say we did not use
this PRNG for generating a session authentication key in our patch.

--------------------------------

Both of the issues reported above would be patched if this pull
request was reviewed by their team and merged.
<https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms/pull/904>

It has been 30 days since I wrote the patch and sent the above pull
request. The timeline (sans the Github notifications that the
AnchorCMS team would have received every time I or someone else
commented on this pull request) looks like this.

* 2015-07-28
  Initial discovery, contacted team on Gitter, instructed to send a PR,
  and we did so.

* 2015-08-11
  After radio silence from the AnchorCMS devs, I reached out to Craig
  Childs who responded the same day. "Thanks for pointing this out to
  me, I understand it’s serious and I’ll look into it as soon as I can."

* 2015-08-27
  We've reached the 30 day mark without the security issues being resolved.
  Furthermore, Paragon Initiative Enterprises has not received any request
  for more time for their team to review the patch. (Note: For most issues,
  we won't delay past 30 days without remediation.)

Looking at the above issues, it may surprise you to hear that
AnchorCMS is not an obscure relic of a forgotten age; it has almost
2500 stars and over 400 forks on Github.

The best advice I can offer anyone is to uninstall AnchorCMS from
their servers. These are just the issues that I could find; there is
undoubtedly many more that are just as bad.

In publishing this, we hope that the AnchorCMS development team is
able to wake up and reconnect with the community, and more importantly
that the community is willing to help them fix the myriad of security
vulnerabilities that probably lurk beneath the surface.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

Good question. This is a timing attack mitigation strategy called "Double HMAC". By using a random nonce (`$blind` above), you eliminate any useful timing information from leaking out.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Anchor CMS

Anchor is a super-simple, lightweight blog system, made to let you just write. [Check out the site](http://anchorcms.com/).

[![Feature Requests](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be3495e4628ec4fa7f272371e752b8fa513c1ae075214bd6d7ee800349039758/687474703a2f2f666561746875622e636f6d2f616e63686f72636d732f616e63686f722d636d733f666f726d61743d737667)](http://feathub.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms)

### Requirements

* PHP 5.3.6+
  + curl
  + mcrypt
  + gd
  + pdo\_mysql or pdo\_sqlite
* MySQL 5.2+

To determine your PHP version, create a new file with this PHP code: `<?php echo PHP_VERSION; // version.php`. This will print your version number to the screen.

### Install

1. Ensure that you have the required components.
2. Download Anchor either from [here](http://anchorcms.com/download) or by cloning this Github repo.
3. Upload Anchor through FTP/SFTP or whatever upload method you prefer to the public-facing directory of your site.
4. Ensure that the permissions for the `content` and `anchor/config` folders are set to `0777`.
5. Create a database for Anchor to install to. You may name it anything you like. The method for database creation varies depending on your webhost but may require using PHPMyAdmin or Sequel Pro. If you are unsure of how to create this, ask your host.
6. Navigate your browser to your Anchor installation URL, if you have placed Anchor in a sub directory make sure you append the folder name to the URL: `http://MYDOMAINNAME.com/anchor`
7. Follow the installer instructions
8. For security purposes, delete the `install` directory when you are done.
