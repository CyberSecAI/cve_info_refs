Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow within the QEMU emulator's VNC display driver.
*   It occurs when the VNC server's display surface is refreshed using the `vnc_refresh_server_surface()` routine.
*   The issue stems from an incorrect calculation of the buffer size when copying data between guest and host memory in the VNC display driver. Specifically, it uses the stride instead of bytes per scanline. The `_cmp_bytes` variable can become negative, leading to memory corruption

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is that a buffer is overflowed in the heap memory during the VNC display refresh operation. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the QEMU process to crash, leading to a denial of service for the virtual machine.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  It is possible that this vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host system with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **VNC Display Driver:** The vulnerability resides in the QEMU VNC display driver.
*   **Guest User:** A privileged user inside the guest operating system is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Guest User:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest VM.
*   **VNC Enabled:** The virtual machine must have the VNC display enabled.
*   **Guest Access to Host:** The privileged guest user must have some capability to trigger the refresh operation to cause the overflow.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how `vnc_refresh_server_surface()` calculates buffer size using the stride of the image instead of the bytes per scanline.
*   The variable `cmp_bytes` used to determine the number of bytes to compare can become negative.
*   The fix involves adding a new variable (guest_ll) for the guest scanline length. and renaming `min_stride` to `line_bytes`, and an assert to make sure `cmp_bytes` is never negative.
*   The affected code is primarily within the `ui/vnc.c` file.

**Additional Information**
*   Red Hat has rated this as an Important security issue.
*   Several Red Hat products are affected, including Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
*   The issue was reported by Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc.
*   Patches have been backported to address the vulnerability in affected Red Hat products.
*   Debian has also issued a security advisory regarding this vulnerability.
*   The fix was included in QEMU version 2.4.0.1.
