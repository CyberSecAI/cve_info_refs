Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Add Admin Exploit**
   - **Root Cause:** The application does not perform sufficient validity checks on HTTP requests, allowing actions to be triggered without proper user verification.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of CSRF protection.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can create a malicious website that, when visited by a logged-in user, forces the user's browser to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application, leading to unauthorized actions (e.g., creating a new admin user).
   - **Attack Vector:**  A user visits a malicious website containing a crafted form that makes a request to the vulnerable application while the user is authenticated.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to host a webpage and lure a logged-in user to visit it.

**2. Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
   - **Root Cause:**  Input parameters are not properly sanitized before being displayed to the user.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into the application. This code can be executed in the browsers of other users who interact with the compromised content.
      -  **Categories Stored XSS:** The `name` parameter within the Categories settings is vulnerable to stored XSS.
      -  **Links Stored XSS:**  The `title` and `rel` parameters within the Links settings are vulnerable to stored XSS.
      - **Ping Server Reflected XSS:** The `url` parameter within the PingServers module is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
   - **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious script via vulnerable parameters. When other users view the affected content (categories, links, ping server response), the malicious script is executed.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application to inject the malicious script data into the database.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF (CVE-2015-5530):** Allows for unauthorized actions by a logged-in user.
*   **Multiple Stored XSS:** Allows for injection of malicious script code that is executed in user browsers.
