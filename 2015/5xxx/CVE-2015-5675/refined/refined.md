Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of exceptions (#SS or #NP) generated by the `IRET` (return from interrupt) instruction in the FreeBSD kernel on amd64 architecture. When an `IRET` instruction triggers such exceptions, the exception handler fails to properly reload the kernel's GS segment register base.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate GS Segment Handling:** The kernel's exception handler does not ensure the correct GS segment base is loaded after an `IRET` instruction causes a #SS or #NP exception.
- **Potential for Userland GS Usage:** This flaw allows the kernel to potentially use the GS segment base set by userland, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the kernel to use an arbitrary GS base. This could allow the attacker to escalate privileges by manipulating kernel data.
- **System Panic:** The exploitation can also cause the system to crash (panic).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Triggering IRET with Exceptions:** The attacker needs to trigger an `IRET` instruction that generates an #SS or #NP exception within the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
- The attacker must be able to execute code that can trigger the specific IRET exception condition.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects FreeBSD 9.3 and 10.1.
- The issue is specific to the amd64 architecture.
- Patches were released to address the vulnerability in stable and releng branches.
