{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Kubernetes fails to validate object name types before passing the data to etcd.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation of object names."
    ],
    "impact": "The etcd service generates keys based on the object name type, which can lead to a directory path traversal vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data to arbitrary locations within the etcd data store.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious object name type, an attacker can cause etcd to write data to a location outside of the intended directory."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify objects within the Kubernetes cluster. This would typically require some level of authenticated access to the Kubernetes API."
  }
