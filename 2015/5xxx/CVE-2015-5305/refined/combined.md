# RHSA-2015:1945 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kubernetes security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1945)

## Topic

Updated kubernetes packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the references section.

## Description

Kubernetes allows orchestration and control of Docker containers as used in OpenShift Enterprise 3.

Kubernetes fails to validate object name types before passing the data to etcd. As the etcd service generates keys based on the object name type this can lead to a directory path traversal. (CVE-2015-5305)

Red Hat would like to thank Jordan Liggitt for discovering and
reporting this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1273969#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-10-21 15:32:41 UTC  ``` Jordan Liggitt of Red Hat reports:  No validation is performed on the names of some object types. Because the etcd  key is built directly from the object name, this allows path traversal when  writing data.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1273969#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2015-10-21 15:35:22 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by Jordan Liggitt of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1273969#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-27 18:41:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL 7 Version of OpenShift Enterprise 3.0  Via RHSA-2015:1945 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1945](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015%3A1945)   ``` |  |
