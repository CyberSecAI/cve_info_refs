Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-5536:

**Vulnerability Overview:**
CVE-2015-5536 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Belkin N300 Dual-Band Wi-Fi Range Extender. The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of specific parameters in various HTTP requests, allowing for the injection of arbitrary operating system commands.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the web interface of the Belkin N300 Dual-Band Wi-Fi Range Extender. Specifically, several different forms, such as `formWlanSetupWPS`, `formUSBStorage`, `formWpsStart`, `formConnectionSetting`, `formWlanMP`, `formBSSetSitesurvey`, `formiNICWpsStart`, and `formHwSet` are vulnerable. By injecting malicious code into the parameters of these forms, an attacker can execute commands on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands through specific parameters in HTTP requests.
    - `formWlanSetupWPS`: vulnerable parameter `wps_enrolee_pin`
    - `formUSBStorage`: vulnerable parameter `sub_dir`
    - `formWpsStart`: vulnerable parameter `pinCode`
    - `formConnectionSetting`: vulnerable to multiple parameters
    - `formWlanMP`: vulnerable to multiple parameters
    - `formBSSetSitesurvey`: vulnerable to multiple parameters
    - `formiNICWpsStart`: vulnerable parameter `pinCode`
    - `formHwSet`: vulnerable to multiple parameters
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The device's firmware fails to properly sanitize or validate user inputs, enabling command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to:
- **Remote Code Execution:** Arbitrary operating system commands can be executed on the affected device.
- **Root Access:** The injected commands are executed under the context of the root user, granting the attacker complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through HTTP requests.
- **Web Interface:** Attackers target the web interface of the Belkin N300 Dual-Band Wi-Fi Range Extender.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
- **Authentication:** Exploitation requires prior authentication to the device's web interface.

**Affected Product:**
- Belkin N300 Dual-Band Wi-Fi Range Extender (F9K1111)

**Additional Notes:**
-  Belkin released a firmware update to address these vulnerabilities.
-  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected via Digital Vaccine filters, specific filter IDs are noted in the advisories.
- All vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Elvis Collado of HP DVLabs.
