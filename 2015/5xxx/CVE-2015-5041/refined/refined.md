  "CVE-2015-5041": {
    "description": "Multiple buffer overflows in the (1) png_set_PLTE and (2) png_get_PLTE functions in libpng before 1.0.64, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.54, 1.3.x and 1.4.x before 1.4.17, 1.5.x before 1.5.24, and 1.6.x before 1.6.19 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a small bit-depth value in an IHDR (aka image header) chunk in a PNG image.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a buffer overflow in the png_set_PLTE and png_get_PLTE functions within the libpng library. These functions do not properly check the size of the data related to bit-depth values, allowing for a specially crafted PNG image with a small bit-depth to cause an out-of-bounds write.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow: Improper bounds checking in the png_set_PLTE() and png_get_PLTE() functions."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly other unspecified impacts, such as arbitrary code execution if memory corruption is achieved.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a PNG image with a small bit-depth value in the IHDR chunk."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed PNG image and have a vulnerable application parse the crafted image. No special authentication or privileges are needed for the attack, just user interaction to open the malformed PNG file using vulnerable software.",
	  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a small bit-depth value is supplied within the IHDR chunk of a PNG image. This value is used to calculate the size of palette data, which, if sufficiently small, leads to a buffer overflow when the palette data is copied. The functions `png_set_PLTE` and `png_get_PLTE` are the vulnerable entry points in the libpng library"
