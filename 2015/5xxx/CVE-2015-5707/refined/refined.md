Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5707:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `sg_start_req` function within the SCSI generic (sg) driver (`drivers/scsi/sg.c`) of the Linux kernel.
- This function uses the `iov_count` value, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer, to calculate the total number of pages needed in `bio_map_user_iov()`. 
- If `iov_count` is large enough, the calculation of the sum of the sizes of iovecs can wrap around, resulting in a smaller than needed allocation of the page pointers array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow during the calculation of the total size of memory required, based on the input `iov_count`.
-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly check or limit the size of the provided `iov_count` before using it in the calculation.
-   **Heap Overflow:** Due to the undersized array allocation, subsequent writes in the `bio_map_user_iov` function, while mapping iovecs, can cause a heap buffer overflow as the writes go out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user could trigger the overflow leading to a system crash due to the heap overflow.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  It was mentioned that this vulnerability potentially could be used to escalate privileges.
-   **Unspecified Impact:** Some descriptions mention the possibility of other unspecified impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

- A local attacker with write access to a SCSI generic device.
- The attacker crafts a write request with a large `iov_count` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have a user account on the system.
- The attacker needs write permission to a SCSI generic device.

**Additional details from content:**

-   The fix involves adding a check to make sure that `iov_count` does not exceed `MAX_UIOVEC`.
-   The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 4.1-rc1 but backports may require extra steps.
-   The commit that fixed the vulnerability was `451a2886b6bf90e2fb378f7c46c655450fb96e81`.
-   Another related fix commit is `fdc81f45e9f57858da6351836507fbcf1b7583ee`, which uses `import_iovec()`.
-   Multiple Linux distributions including SUSE, Ubuntu and Debian were affected.
-   SUSE addressed the vulnerability using live patches for some specific kernel versions.
-   Ubuntu also released security notices and kernel updates to address this issue.
-   Android was also impacted which required security updates.
-   Red Hat also published a Security Advisory(RHSA-2015:1778) for the fix.
-   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel from version 2.6.28 through 4.x.
