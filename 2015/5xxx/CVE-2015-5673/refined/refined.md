{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ISUCON5 qualifier portal web application (eventapp) makes improper `popen` calls, which allows for OS command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "A logged-in attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests by including shell metacharacters in an argument to a 'gcloud compute' command.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be logged into the system. Since the application is a web application, this would likely be through the web interface."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    {
      "name": "ISUCON5 qualifier portal web application (eventapp)",
      "versions": "versions prior to commit 150e3e6d851acb31a0b15ce93380a7dab14203fa"
    }
  ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in `eventapp/lib/gcloud.rb`. The fix involves modifying the `IO.popen` call to use an array to pass arguments, which prevents the shell from interpreting metacharacters. The vulnerable code uses string interpolation to construct the command passed to `popen`, which allows for shell injection. The fix uses the array form of `popen` to avoid this issue."
