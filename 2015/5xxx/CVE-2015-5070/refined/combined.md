This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use looks\_like\_pbl() to disallow .pbl file inclusion (bug #23504)

```
This function is implemented using case-insensitive pattern matching,
unlike filesystem::ends_with(). I missed this when writing my original
fix, so the vulnerability still applied to .pbl files on a
case-insensitive filesystem (e.g. NTFS and FAT* on Windows) by using
different case to bypass the check.
```

Use CVE-2015-5069 for the vulnerability in versions before 1.12.3 that
allowed access upon supplying a pathname ending in .pbl (lowercase).

Use CVE-2015-5070 for the vulnerability in versions 1.12.3 and earlier
that allowed access upon supplying a pathname ending with a mixed-case
or uppercase .pbl.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1236010#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-06-26 10:55:26 UTC  ``` Quoting from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/06/25/2> "Wesnoth implements a text preprocessing language that is used in conjunction  with its own game scripting language. It also has a built-in Lua interpreter  and API. Both the Lua API and the preprocessor make use of the same function  (filesystem::get_wml_location()) to resolve file paths so that only content  from the user's data directory can be read.  However, the function did not explicitly disallow files with the .pbl  extension. The contents of these files could thus be stored in saved game  files or even transmitted directly to other users in a networked game. Among  the information that's compromised is a user-defined passphrase used to  authenticate uploads to the game's content server.  This issue was found by Toom Lõhmus, then verified and fixed by Ignacio R.  Morelle."  There have been two patches, [3] and [4]. Patch [3] did only take lowercase extensions into account and was incomplete. Patch [3] is [CVE-2015-5069](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5069). Patch [4] is an additional patch, fixing the lowercase problem. Patch [4] is [CVE-2015-5070](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5070).  [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/06/25/2> [2] <https://gna.org/bugs/?23504> (currently restricted)  Patches:  Incomplete fix as it only handles lowercase extensions.
