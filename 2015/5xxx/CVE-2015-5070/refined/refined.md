Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `filesystem::get_wml_location()` function of the Wesnoth game engine. This function is responsible for resolving file paths, ensuring that only content from the user's data directory is read. The initial fix for disallowing `.pbl` file inclusion only checked for lowercase `.pbl` extensions. This allowed attackers to bypass the check by using mixed-case or uppercase `.pbl` extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Case-insensitive bypass:** The initial fix used a case-sensitive check, failing to prevent the inclusion of files with extensions like `.PBL` or `.PbL`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By including malicious `.pbl` files, attackers could potentially access sensitive information, including a user-defined passphrase used for authenticating uploads to the game's content server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication bypass:** By gaining access to the user's passphrase, attackers could potentially upload malicious content to the game's content server.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored within `.pbl` files could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Saved game files:** Malicious `.pbl` files could be embedded in saved game files.
*   **Networked games:** The files could be transmitted directly to other users in a networked game.
*   **WML and Lua API:** Both the game's text preprocessing language (WML) and the Lua API are susceptible due to their shared use of the vulnerable path resolution function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** An attacker would need to know that `.pbl` files are not explicitly disallowed in all cases and how to exploit the path resolution.
*   **Ability to create or modify game files:** Attackers would need to be able to create a malicious `.pbl` file and embed it into a game save or transmit it to other players.

**Additional Notes:**

*   CVE-2015-5069 was assigned to the initial, incomplete fix that only handled lowercase extensions.
*   CVE-2015-5070 was assigned to the more general, correct fix which addressed the case-insensitive bypass.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Toom LÃµhmus and fixed by Ignacio R. Morelle.
*   The fix involved using a case-insensitive pattern matching function `looks_like_pbl()` instead of `ends_with()`, which was case-sensitive and used in the initial fix.
