Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Hawtio console in Red Hat AMQ had a misconfiguration in its Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings. Specifically, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was set to allow all origins ("*").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Permissive CORS Policy:** The vulnerability lies in the overly permissive CORS configuration, where the Hawtio console allowed cross-origin requests from any domain. This weakens the security model of the console and makes it susceptible to cross-site attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Access:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information handled by the Hawtio console.
- **Other Attacks:** The excessive access granted by the permissive CORS configuration might enable attackers to perform other types of attacks against the console and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could craft a malicious webpage that makes requests to the vulnerable Hawtio console on behalf of an authenticated user. Because the console allows requests from any origin, the browser would allow these cross-origin requests.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly mentioned, the permissive CORS could potentially be a stepping stone for a more elaborate attack if combined with an XSS vulnerability in the console or application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system. They can perform the attack remotely by hosting a malicious webpage or using other techniques to initiate cross-origin requests.
- **Target User Access:** The attacker would need to target a user who is currently authenticated with the vulnerable Hawtio console.
- **Knowledge of Target URL**: An attacker needs the URL of the vulnerable AMQ console.
