| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:43:48 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client certain processed incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function:  The loop's only stopping conditions are receiving a complete and correct response or hitting a small number of error conditions. If the packet contains incorrect values that don't trigger one of the error conditions, the loop continues to receive new packets.  A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. This attack requires the attacker to do one of the following:  * Own a malicious NTP server that the client trusts  * Prevent a legitimate NTP server from sending packets to the 'ntpq' client  * MITM the 'ntpq' communications between the 'ntpq' client and the NTP server   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:51:11 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit> <http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0080/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 12:02:11 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1300277](show_bug.cgi?id=1300277 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-7974 CVE-2015-8138 CVE-2015-7973 CVE-2015-7975 CVE-2015-7976 CVE-2015-7977 CVE-2015-7978 CVE-2015-7979 CVE-2015-8158 CVE-2015-8139 CVE-2015-8140 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 14:36:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

## Details

Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain remote

config packets. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated

attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in

a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5146](/security/CVE-2015-5146))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logconfig

directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5194](/security/CVE-2015-5194))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain statistics

types. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5195](/security/CVE-2015-5195))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain file

paths. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service, or overwrite certain files. ([CVE-2015-5196](/security/CVE-2015-5196), [CVE-2015-7703](/security/CVE-2015-7703))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to hang,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5219](/security/CVE-2015-5219))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP

incorrectly handled restarting after hitting a panic threshold. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to alter the system time on clients.

([CVE-2015-5300](/security/CVE-2015-5300))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled autokey data packets. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-7691](/security/CVE-2015-7691), [CVE-2015-7692](/security/CVE-2015-7692), [CVE-2015-7702](/security/CVE-2015-7702))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing

certain autokey messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to cause NTP to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-7701](/security/CVE-2015-7701))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP

incorrectly handled rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to cause clients to stop updating their clock. ([CVE-2015-7704](/security/CVE-2015-7704),

[CVE-2015-7705](/security/CVE-2015-7705))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logfile and keyfile

directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to enter a loop, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7850](/security/CVE-2015-7850))

Yves Younan and Aleksander Nikolich discovered that NTP incorrectly handled

ascii conversion. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7852](/security/CVE-2015-7852))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled reference clock memory.

A malicious refclock could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-7853](/security/CVE-2015-7853))

John D "Doug" Birdwell discovered that NTP incorrectly handled decoding

certain bogus values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7855](/security/CVE-2015-7855))

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled symmetric association

authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly bypass

authentication and alter the system clock. ([CVE-2015-7871](/security/CVE-2015-7871))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP

AppArmor profile.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

Message-ID: <55DC3431.6000008@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 25 Aug 2015 11:24:01 +0200
From: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Several low impact ntp.org ntpd issues

Miroslav Lichvár found several low-impact security issues in our ntp
branch, most of which have already been addressed upstream without
noting their security impact.

The first three issues require authentication.  Considering the low
impact and the availability of upstream fixes for most of the issues,
we'd like to make the issues public as soon as possible, unless there
are any objections.

(Impact may be higher if ntpd runs with root privileges.)

* CVE-2015-5194
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1254542>

It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when
processing malformed logconfig configuration commands, for example:

ntpq -c ":config logconfig a"

Upstream fix:

<<http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=4c4fc141LwvcoGp-lLGhkAFp3ZvtrA>>
<<https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/553f2fa65865c31c5e3c48812cfd46176cffdd27>>

* CVE-2015-5195
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1254544>

It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a statistics
type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) is
referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command, for example:

ntpq -c ':config statistics timingstats'
ntpq -c ':config filegen timingstats'

Upstream fix:

<<http://bk.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=4d253ed0A400LyhRQIV0u23NJwuGAA>>
<<https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/52e977d79a0c4ace997e5c74af429844da2f27be>>

* CVE-2015-5196
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1254547>

It was found that the :config command can be used to set the pidfile and
driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing
the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift
of the system clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

No upstream fix, but Miroslav wrote the attached patch.

* CVE-2015-5219
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1255118>

It was discovered that sntp would hang in an infinite loop when a
crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion of the
precision value in the packet to double.

Upstream fix:

<http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=51786731Gr4-NOrTBC_a_uXO4wuGhg>
<https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/5f295cd05c3c136d39f5b3e500a2d781bdbb59c8>

(Reported to the distros list and upstream last week, no request for an
embargo, hence public disclosure.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-18 11:23:07 UTC  ``` It was found that the :config command can be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). For example:  ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid' ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'  In RHEL/Fedora ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits the impact of this issue. Additionally, in the default NTP configuration, runtime configuration with ntpq or ntpdc is limited to localhost, further limiting the impact of this issue.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvár of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c3)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-25 08:37:46 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1256667](show_bug.cgi?id=1256667 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5196 ntp: config command can be used to set the pidfile and drift file paths [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c5)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-25 10:59:55 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-33.fc21 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 21. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-14211>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c6)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-25 11:03:36 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-33.fc22 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 22. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-14212>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c7)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-25 11:05:34 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-33.fc23 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 23. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-14213>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1254547#c8)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-26 04:25:34 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-33.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 testing repository.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0780)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-7703)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2583)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time. (CVE-2015-7979)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-5196, CVE-2015-7703)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A). (CVE-2015-7974)
* A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client processed certain incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. (CVE-2015-8158)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).
