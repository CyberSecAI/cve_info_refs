  "CVE-2015-5195": {
    "description": "Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the referencing of a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation by the statistics or filegen configuration command. By sending a specially crafted config command with statistics type, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way ntpd handles configuration commands related to statistics. Specifically, if a statistics type not compiled into the ntpd binary (e.g., timingstats) is referenced via the statistics or filegen configuration command, it leads to a segmentation fault.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of user-supplied configuration input.",
        "Lack of validation of statistical type existence."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the ntpd daemon. This is achieved by sending a specially crafted configuration command that references a non-existent statistics type.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network access to the ntpd daemon via the ntpq utility."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send configuration commands to the ntpd daemon, typically requiring authentication if remote configuration is not limited to localhost. This can be achieved through the ntpq utility."
