Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2015-5471:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `download.php` file in the wp-swimteam plugin. It fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `file` parameter, before using it in a file system operation. This allows for arbitrary file downloads from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows an attacker to download any file on the server that the webserver user has access to, bypassing intended file access restrictions.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `download.php` script directly uses the `file` parameter received from the user, without any validation or sanitization.
- **Use of `fopen` with User-Supplied Path:** The `fopen` function is used with the unsanitized filename which can lead to reading arbitrary files.
- **No Access Control:** There's no access control on the `download.php` script, meaning any user can attempt the exploit if they know the vulnerable URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files (`wp-config.php`), database credentials, or other sensitive data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Information gained from downloaded files could be used for further exploitation, potentially leading to full compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script.
- **`file` parameter manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the URL to specify the path of the file they wish to download.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Understanding of URL parameters:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to manipulate URL parameters.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin and script:** The attacker must know about the existence and location of the vulnerable `download.php` file within the `wp-swimteam` plugin.
- **No authentication required**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code provided shows an example using curl to download the `/etc/passwd` file:
  `curl "http://www.vapidlabs.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-swimteam/include/user/download.php?file=/etc/passwd&filename=/etc/passwd&contenttype=text/html&transient=1&abspath=/usr/share/wordpress"`
- The exploit requires knowing or guessing the `ABSPATH` value but according to the plugin author, even without the value the script will fail, but still can be guessed or brute forced on some setups.
- The plugin author patched the vulnerability in version 1.45 by implementing nonce verification.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download due to the security issue.
