Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted network packet can trigger a buffer overflow in processes that handle network communications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack by sending overly large packets to the vulnerable process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can cause network communication to become unresponsive or cause the affected process to become unavailable.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the network by transmitting specially crafted packets to the affected processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the affected devices. No authentication is required. A low-skilled attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products (from the advisory):**
The advisory lists a wide range of Yokogawa products that are affected, including:
    *   CENTUM series (CS 1000, CS 3000, CS 3000 Entry, VP, VP Entry)

    *   FAST/TOOLS
    *   B/M9000CS
    *   B/M9000 VP
    *   FieldMate
The advisory also specifies the affected versions for each of the products.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that Yokogawa has released patches to address the vulnerabilities.
*   Mitigation steps include applying firewalls and preventing unapproved devices from connecting to the network, and the use of VPNs for remote access when required.
*   The advisory also provides links to Yokogawa's security advisory and contact information.

The content provides details about the multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in various Yokogawa products, the impact of the vulnerabilities and the recommended mitigation measures, and this information aligns with the description of CVE-2015-5626 as a buffer overflow vulnerability.
