Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5700:

**Root Cause:**

- The `mktexlsr` script in Tex Live was using a predictable filename when creating temporary files in `/tmp`. This filename was constructed using the pattern `${TMPDIR-/tmp}/mktexlsrtrees$$.tmp`, where `$$` represents the process ID. This approach was flawed because the file creation was not atomic, meaning if a file with the same name existed, the script would append to it rather than failing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The use of the process ID to create temporary file names is not sufficient for security, as a local attacker could potentially predict the filenames and create them before the script attempts to.
- **Non-Atomic File Creation:** The script doesn't fail if the file already exists. Instead, it attempts to append to an existing file, opening it up to race conditions.
- **Symlink Attack:** A local attacker could exploit this by creating a symbolic link with the same name as the expected temporary file, pointing to a sensitive file, then waiting for the `mktexlsr` script to append to that symlink, overwriting the target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running `mktexlsr`.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially overwrite a file containing sensitive information, resulting in information disclosure.
- **Potential for further attacks:** By overwriting critical files, an attacker could potentially gain more control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The attacker would need to create a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file the script is attempting to create.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have the ability to create files and symbolic links on the local system.
- The attacker must know when the `mktexlsr` script will be executed to prepare the symlink before it is used by the script.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerability was initially reported on Debian and then tracked on Red Hat Bugzilla.
- The fix involves using the `mktemp` utility with the `--tmpdir` option to create temporary files securely.
- The issue was resolved by changing the temp file creation line to `treefile=$(mktemp --tmpdir mktexlsrtrees.XXXXXXXXXX) || exit 1`
- The fix was implemented in Debian and Ubuntu.
- The vulnerability affects the `mktexlsr` script from the `texlive-bin` package.

**CVE-2015-5700 vs CVE-2015-5701**

The content clarifies that the `mktexlsr` script had this issue at two different times:

- **CVE-2015-5700:** Assigned to the vulnerability introduced in revision 22885 of the `mktexlsr` script which used a predictable temporary file name with no protection against race conditions.
- **CVE-2015-5701:** Assigned to the vulnerability introduced later in revision 36855, likely when the original fix was reverted.

In summary, CVE-2015-5700 highlights a classic temporary file vulnerability that could be exploited using symlink attacks, leading to arbitrary file overwrite and potentially sensitive information disclosure. The fix utilizes `mktemp` to mitigate this risk.
