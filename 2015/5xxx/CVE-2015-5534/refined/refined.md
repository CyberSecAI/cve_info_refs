Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5534

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper verification of the source of HTTP requests in the `/admin/pages/maintenance` script within Oxwall. Specifically, the application fails to implement proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF (CWE-352). This allows an attacker to induce a logged-in administrator to perform unintended actions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the maintenance message, leading to XSS when the message is displayed to site visitors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Website Under Maintenance:** A successful CSRF attack can put the entire website under maintenance mode.
*   **XSS Attacks:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which could:
    *   Steal user cookies
    *   Spread malware
    *   Potentially gain full control over the website

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by tricking an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious web page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on social engineering to get the administrator to visit the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page containing the crafted CSRF exploit.
*   The attacker does not need any specific access to the vulnerable system, only the ability to get a user to visit the malicious page, thus being a remote unauthenticated attack.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability using a crafted HTML form:
```html
<form action = "http://[host]/admin/pages/maintenance" method = "POST">
<input type="hidden" name="form_name" value="maintenance">
<input type="hidden" name="maintenance_enable" value="on">
<input type="hidden" name="save" value="Save">
<input type="hidden" name="maintenance_text" value="<script>alert('ImmuniWeb');</script>">
<input value="submit" id="btn" type="submit" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>
```
This form automatically submits a POST request to the vulnerable `/admin/pages/maintenance` endpoint. The hidden input fields manipulate the maintenance mode settings and inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
*   The affected version is Oxwall 1.7.4 and probably prior versions.
*   The fix is available in Oxwall 1.8.
