Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-5593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an error in the implementation of a `preg_replace` function used within the `sanitize_string` function in Zenphoto. This function attempts to remove `<script>` and `<style>` tags from user-provided content to prevent XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incomplete XSS sanitization:** The `sanitize_string` function uses `preg_replace` to remove `<script>` and `<style>` tags, but it doesn't account for variations in tag syntax or nested tags. Additionally, it relies on `strip_tags` which is not a robust protection mechanism.
-   **`preg_replace` implementation error:** The specific `preg_replace` implementation has a flaw that allows it to be bypassed by using multiple `<script>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated as code execution in this CVE, XSS can be used to potentially redirect to malicious sites, steal session data, and perform other actions in the context of the victimâ€™s browser, or it can indirectly lead to arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through any user input field that is processed by the vulnerable `sanitize_string` function.
-   The specific bypass described is using multiple `<script>` tags in the input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to input data into a field that is sanitized by the vulnerable `sanitize_string` function.
-   No specific privilege is mentioned, meaning it could affect any user input that gets sanitized by the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The CVE description mentions that the `sanitize_string` function was trying to prevent all XSS but had multiple independent types of mistakes.
- The placement of `html_entity_decode` *after* input sanitization also contributes to the overall weakness in XSS protection. This is covered by a separate CVE (CVE-2015-5594).
- The provided text details that the specific vulnerability (CVE-2015-5593) is related to the implementation error within `preg_replace` when multiple `<script>` tags are present.
