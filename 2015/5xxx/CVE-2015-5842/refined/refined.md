Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5842:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2015-5842

**Root Cause:** An issue existed in XNU (the kernel of macOS, iOS, etc.) that led to the disclosure of kernel memory.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in insufficient initialization of kernel memory structures, leading to a potential leak of sensitive data.

**Impact:** A local user could exploit this to determine the layout of kernel memory. This information could be leveraged to bypass security measures or obtain system privileges, but this vulnerability itself does not grant those privileges.

**Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device or system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need local access to the system. No specific user privileges are mentioned as a prerequisite.
