Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the processing of the `opendoc` message in Adobe Reader. A specially crafted `opendoc` message can cause an integer overflow when calculating the size of a memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** An integer overflow occurs in the size calculation before a memory allocation. This leads to allocating a smaller buffer than required.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A subsequent `strncpy` call attempts to copy data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Medium Integrity Code Execution:**  The exploit can lead to code execution at medium integrity level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing the crafted `opendoc` message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious `opendoc` message.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious content either through a website or a malicious file.
