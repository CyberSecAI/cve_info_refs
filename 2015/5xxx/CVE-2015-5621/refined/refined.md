Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `snmp_pdu_parse()` function in `snmp_api.c` of the net-snmp library.
*   The function allocates memory for a `netsnmp_variable_list` structure to store parsed SNMP variables.
*   If `snmp_pdu_parse()` fails during packet parsing, it doesn't remove the allocated but incompletely initialized `netsnmp_variable_list` item from the list of variables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete Initialization:** The `snmp_pdu_parse()` function allocates memory for a `netsnmp_variable_list` structure, but in the event of a parsing error does not fully initialize it, particularly leaving the `type` member uninitialized.
*   **Dangling Pointers:** The uninitialized `netsnmp_variable_list` item remains linked to the list of variables, leading to dangling pointers.
*   **Memory Leak:** Memory is allocated for the `netsnmp_variable_list`, but not freed when parsing fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets that trigger parsing failures. The subsequent use of the uninitialized `netsnmp_variable_list` can cause a crash in various functions and lead to a denial of service.
*   **Possible Code Execution:** Although the reports primarily observed crashes and NULL pointer dereferences, there is a possibility of arbitrary code execution due to the use of uninitialized values. The reports suggest a potential for code execution, but the primary confirmed impact is DoS.
*   **Memory leak**:  Due to memory being allocated for `netsnmp_variable_list` and then not freed in case of parsing errors.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SNMP packet to the affected net-snmp service.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send packets to the port used by the SNMP service (typically UDP 161).
*   **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge about the structure of SNMP packets, and how to craft a malformed one to trigger a parsing error and the use of uninitialized members of `netsnmp_variable_list`.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of net-snmp before the patch.
*   The fix involves adding a call to free memory of allocated `netsnmp_variable_list` structures when parsing fails and ensuring that members are initialized, preventing the use of uninitialized members in later operations.
