Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5066

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the GeniXCMS application, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent XSS:** Malicious scripts injected into the `content` and `title` input fields are stored and executed when the affected content is rendered. Specifically:
    *   XSS in the `content` field is executed after a post is published.
    *   XSS in the `title` field executes immediately.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts injected via the `q` parameter are reflected back to the user in the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, and potentially other malicious actions depending on the attacker's intent.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Persistent XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious script and submits it via the `content` or `title` fields when creating or editing a post through the admin panel (specifically the `index.php?page=posts&act=add` endpoint). This payload is stored in the database and executed when the content is displayed to other users, including administrators.
*  **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a script in the `q` parameter of the request (specifically the `index.php?page=posts` endpoint). When a user accesses the link, the script is reflected back in the response and executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For Persistent XSS via the `content` and `title` fields, the attacker needs administrative or content creation access to the GeniXCMS admin panel.
*   For Reflected XSS via the `q` parameter, the attacker can trick any user (including an administrator) into clicking the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was found in GeniXCMS version 0.0.3.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability affects the `index.php` file.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using GET and POST requests.
*   The vendor has released version 0.0.4 as a security update to address this vulnerability.
