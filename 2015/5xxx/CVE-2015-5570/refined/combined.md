# CVE-2015-5571

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-5570.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-5572.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-5571 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5571)

#### Description

Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.241 and 19.x before 19.0.0.185 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.521 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.190, Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.190, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 19.0.0.190 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4671 and CVE-2014-5333.
