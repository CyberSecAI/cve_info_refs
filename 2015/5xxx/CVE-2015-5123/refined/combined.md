Alert
# Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 29, 2016
Alert CodeTA15-195A

### Systems Affected

Microsoft Windows systems with Adobe Flash Player installed.

### Overview

Used in conjunction, recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. Since attackers continue to target and find new vulnerabilities in popular, Internet-facing software, updating is not sufficient, and it is important to use exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

The following vulnerabilities illustrate the need for ongoing mitigation techniques and prioritization of updates for highly targeted software:

* Adobe Flash use-after-free and memory corruption vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) Adobe Flash Player contains critical vulnerabilities within the ActionScript 3 ByteArray, opaqueBackground and BitmapData classes. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
* Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2015-2387](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2387))
  The Adobe Type Manager module contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to obtain system privileges on an affected Windows system. The Adobe Type Manager is a Microsoft Windows component present in every version since NT 4.0. The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is local privilege escalation.

#### Vulnerability Chaining

By convincing a user to visit a website or open a file containing specially crafted Flash content, an attacker could combine any one of the three Adobe Flash vulnerabilities with the Microsoft Windows vulnerability to take full control of an affected system.

A common attack vector for exploiting a Flash vulnerability is to entice a user to load Flash content in a web browser, and most web browsers have Flash installed and enabled. A second attack vector for Flash vulnerabilities is through a file (such as an email attachment) that embeds Flash content. Another technique leverages Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) capabilities in Microsoft Office documents to automatically download Flash content from a remote server.

An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code through the Flash vulnerability could exploit the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability to gain elevated system privileges. The Adobe Type Manager vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass sandbox defenses (such as those found in Adobe Reader and Google Chrome) and low integrity protections (such as Protected Mode Internet Explorer and Protected View for Microsoft Office).

### Impact

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Exploitation of the Adobe Type Manager vulnerability could then allow the attacker to execute code with system privileges.

### Solution

Since attackers regularly target widely deployed, Internet-accessible software such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Windows, it is important to prioritize updates for these products to defend against known vulnerabilities.

Since attackers regularly discover new vulnerabilities for which updates do not exist, it is important to enable exploit mitigation and other defensive techniques.

#### Apply Security Updates

The Adobe Flash vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5119](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119), [CVE-2015-5122](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5123)) are addressed in Adobe Security Bulletins [APSB15-16](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html) and [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletins and apply the necessary updates.

The Microsoft Windows Adobe Type Manager vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) is addressed in Microsoft security Bulletin [MS15-077](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-077). Users are encouraged to review the Bulletin and apply the necessary updates.

Additional information regarding the vulnerabilities can be found in Vulnerability Notes [VU#561288](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/561288), [VU#338736](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/338736), [VU#918568](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918568), and [VU#103336](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103336).

#### Limit Flash Content

Do not run untrusted Flash content. Most web browsers have Flash enabled by default, however, it may be possible to enable click-to-play features. For information see  <http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/>

#### **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)**

EMET can be used to help prevent exploitation of the Flash vulnerabilities. In particular, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) can be configured to help restrict Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer from loading the Flash ActiveX control. See the following link for additional information: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50766>

Quoting from the APSA15-04:  Critical vulnerabilities ([CVE-2015-5122](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5122), [CVE-2015-5123](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5123)) have been identified in Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.204 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh and Linux. Successful exploitation could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.    Adobe is aware of reports that exploits targeting these vulnerabilities have been published publicly. Adobe expects to make updates available during the week of July 12, 2015.  <https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa15-04.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1242216#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-12 12:02:44 UTC  ``` These issues, similar to recently fixed [CVE-2015-5119](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5119) ([bug 1240832](show_bug.cgi?id=1240832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5119 flash-plugin: code execution issue in APSA15-03 / APSB15-16")), are also related to the Hacking Team compromise incident:  [CVE-2015-5122](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5122) <https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/07/cve-2015-5122_-_seco.html> <http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/another-zero-day-vulnerability-arises-from-hacking-team-data-leak/>  [CVE-2015-5123](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5123) <http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2015-5123-in-adobe-flash-emerges-from-hacking-team-leak/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1242216#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-14 17:18:10 UTC  ``` Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-18 for Adobe Flash Player was published for these issues.

---

### Overview

Adobe Flash Player contains a vulnerability in the ActionScript 3 BitmapData object, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Adobe Flash Player versions 9.0 through version 18.0.0.204 contain amemory corruption vulnerability in the [AS3 BitmapData class](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/BitmapData.html). Proof-of-concept exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.  Please see Adobe Security Bulletin [APSA15-04](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa15-04.html) for more details about affected Flash versions. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running Flash Player. Attacks typically involve enticing a user to visit a web site containing specially-crafted Flash content, or to open a specially-crafted Microsoft Office document. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Flash Player Desktop 18.0.0.209. See Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB15-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html) for more details. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Do not run untrusted Flash content**To defend against this and other, as yet unknown vulnerabilities, disable Flash in your browser or enable [Click-to-Play](http://www.howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser) features. Adobe has also provided instructions for how to [uninstall Flash on Windows](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html) and [Mac](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html) platforms.**Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/emet) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. In particular, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) can be configured to help restrict Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer from loading the Flash ActiveX control. |

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes two security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes two vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-18
listed in the References section.

Two flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content.
An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted SWF file
that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF content.
(CVE-2015-5122, CVE-2015-5123)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.491.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
