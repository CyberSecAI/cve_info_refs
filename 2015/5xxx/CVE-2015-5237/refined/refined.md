```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An integer overflow occurs when the protobuf library and code generated by the protobuf compiler store size information in an `int` variable. On 64-bit architectures, this can lead to truncation of size values, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. This overflow occurs during the serialization process in `google::protobuf::MessageLite::SerializeToString`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: A heap buffer overflow can be exploited for code execution.
- Attack vectors: By providing a protobuf message larger than 4GB which causes the int size to overflow during serialization.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to control the size of the serialized message.
