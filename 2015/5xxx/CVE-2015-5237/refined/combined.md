Message-ID: <55DEDEB9.5060000@redhat.com>
Date: Thu, 27 Aug 2015 11:56:09 +0200
From: Florian Weimer <fweimer@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2015-5237: Integer overflow in protobuf serialization (currently
 minor)

<https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/760>

This is currently not intended to be addressed upstream, which is a bit
disappointing.  It's true that this issue does not have much exposure
right now, but in a couple of years, the message sizes involved will not
seem so gigantic anymore.  And as explained in the bug report, fixing
this will be difficult because it involves updating generated code; it
won't be a simple library update.

# CVE-2015-5237: Integer overflow in serialization #760

## Description

[![@fweimer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2729073?v=4&size=48)](/fweimer)[fweimer](https://github.com/fweimer)opened [on Aug 27, 2015](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/760#issue-103459044)

`int` is used to express the size of serialized messages. If the size exceeds 4 GiB, the application may allocate a buffer which is too small, or protobuf itself does this, in `google::protobuf::MessageLite::SerializeToString`. This lead to a heap buffer overflow, which may be exploitable for code execution in some cases.

It has been suggested that serialization of messages larger than 2 GiB is unsupported. But there is no good way for an application to ensure that the limit is not exceeded accidentally, without imposing rather draconian limits. To some degree, this is an `gets`-style interface.

Right now, this is more or less harmless because the message sizes involved are substantial. But this will change over time. My worry is that it will be difficult to fix this because some of the overflowing computations end up in generated `*.pb.cc` files, so the eventual fix will not be a simple library update.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1256426#c0)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-24 14:32:30 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the protobuf library and code generated by the protobuf compiler store size information in an int variable, which may truncate size values on 64-bit architectures, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1256426#c2)  Florian Weimer    2015-08-27 08:53:18 UTC  ``` Upstream bug: <https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/760>   ``` |  |
