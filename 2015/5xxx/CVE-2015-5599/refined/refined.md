Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5599:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies within the `upload.php` file of the `wp-powerplaygallery` WordPress plugin. This file contains flawed logic related to file uploads and SQL queries, leading to multiple security issues. The issues stem from insecure handling of user-supplied input:

1.  **Directory Traversal:** The plugin allows directory creation outside of the intended upload path by using `../` in the `targetDir` variable, which isn't sanitized before being passed to the `mkdir()` function.
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin doesn't validate the type or content of uploaded files. It saves uploaded files to a predictable path without any checks, enabling the uploading of arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The plugin constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied data into an `INSERT` statement without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows for SQL injection by manipulating the `albumid` or `name` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `mkdir` function allows the attacker to control directory creation via the `targetDir` variable without proper input sanitization. This allows creating directories outside of the intended upload path, specifically by using `../` within user-controlled input.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin does not validate the file extension of uploaded files, which leads to the ability to upload arbitrary files such as a malicious php web shell, potentially resulting in remote code execution.
*   **SQL Injection:** The use of unsanitized user-supplied data in an SQL query allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to potential data breaches, manipulation, or other unauthorized database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload**: An attacker can upload malicious PHP files (webshells) to the server, which could lead to complete compromise of the website and the underlying server by achieving remote code execution.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially modify or steal sensitive information.
*  **Directory Traversal**: Creation of arbitrary directories could be used for denial-of-service attacks or file-system manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending HTTP POST requests to the `upload.php` file with maliciously crafted parameters:
    *   `albumid` and `name` parameters can be manipulated for SQL injection.
    *   `file` parameters used to upload arbitrary files, including php files that can be used to remotely execute code.
    *   manipulating the target directory by using `../` in the directory creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site where the vulnerable `wp-powerplaygallery` plugin is installed.
*  No authentication is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   Basic understanding of HTTP requests, file uploads, and SQL syntax is needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `wp-powerplaygallery` version 3.3.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a shell to the vulnerable server.
* The CVE assignment notes that the issues are not present in the upstream example code from Plupload.
* CVE-2015-5599 was assigned to the SQL Injection issue, with CVE-2015-5681 and CVE-2015-5682 assigned to the file upload and directory traversal vulnerabilities respectively in the same plugin.
