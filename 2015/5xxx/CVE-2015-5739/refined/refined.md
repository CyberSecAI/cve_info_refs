  "CVE-2015-5739": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The `net/textproto` library in Go incorrectly treated spaces as hyphens in HTTP header keys.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper parsing of HTTP header keys",
          "Invalid characters in headers are not rejected"
      ],
      "Impact": "Allows an attacker to inject invalid headers that can be misinterpreted by reverse proxies or other intermediaries, leading to HTTP request smuggling.",
      "Attack Vector": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with header keys containing spaces to a vulnerable server.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable `net/http` library, and have this traffic be proxied by an intermediary."
    },
        "Affected Software": {
            "Affected Versions": "Go versions 1.4.2 and earlier, and potentially 1.5 before patches were applied.",
            "Fixed Versions": "Go versions 1.4.3 and 1.5 (with relevant patches)."
        },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Fix Information": "The vulnerability was fixed by modifying the `CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey` function to not treat spaces as hyphens when canonicalizing headers, and return invalid header without modification.",
    "Relevant Patches": [
          "https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9"
        ]
