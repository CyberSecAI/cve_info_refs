| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 08:38:44 UTC  ``` There have been found potentially exploitable flaws in Golang net/http library affecting versions 1.4.2 and 1.5.  Problems: * Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error, the second Content-length is ignored. * Invalid headers are parsed as valid headers (like "Content Length:" with a space in the middle)  Exploitations: In a situation where the net/http agent HTTP communication with the final http clients is using some reverse proxy (reverse proxy cache, SSL terminators, etc), some requests can be made exploiting the net/http HTTP protocol violations.  Attacker could possibly: * bypass security controls on theses previous elements * perform some cache poisoning on these elements * alter the request/response map on these previous elements (for DOS)  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/237>  Upstream patches: <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 08:39:24 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1250353](show_bug.cgi?id=1250353 "CLOSED ERRATA - golang: HTTP request smuggling in net/http library [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c2)  Adam Mariš    2015-08-05 09:03:59 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1250374](show_bug.cgi?id=1250374 "CLOSED ERRATA - golang: HTTP request smuggling in net/http library [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c3)  Vincent Batts    2015-08-05 21:10:18 UTC  ``` is <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/26049f6f9171d1190f3bbe05ec304845cfe6399f> also to be included?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c4)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-06 08:53:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Mariš from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c0)) > Upstream patches: > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9>  [CVE-2015-5739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5739)  > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>  [CVE-2015-5740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5740)  > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>  [CVE-2015-5741](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5741)  Assignment details at: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/294>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c5)  Martin Prpič    2015-08-06 09:28:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Batts from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1250352#c3)) > is > <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/26049f6f9171d1190f3bbe05ec304845cfe6399f> > also to be included?

```
This was originally done in <https://codereview.appspot.com/5690059>
(Feb 2012) to deal with bad response headers coming back from webcams,
but it presents a potential security problem with HTTP request
smuggling for request headers containing "Content Length" instead of
"Content-Length".

Part of overall HTTP hardening for request smuggling. See RFC 7230.

Thanks to Régis Leroy for the report.

# Re: CVE Request - Go net/http library - HTTP smuggling

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

```
> ```
> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9>

```

For purposes of CVE assignments, we feel that this needs to be
categorized separately from the other parts of the report. The primary
factor is that there are different sets of affected versions. This
behavior apparently was not present in all versions of Go: it was
added in February 2012. Also, it is not really an error in determining
the semantics of a set of headers; it's a security-relevant error in
interpretation of the syntax of an individual header.

Use CVE-2015-5739.

```
> ```
> <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>
>
> * Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error,
> the second Content-length is ignored
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2015-5740 for the reporter's finding of a security-relevant
RFC 7230 3.3.3 4 violation ("MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
status code").

300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f also has code changes that
were not mentioned in your "as provided by the reporter" section. Our
interpretation is that there were separate internal discoveries of
other security-relevant RFC 7230 violations, such as "MUST NOT send a
Content-Length header field in any message that contains a
Transfer-Encoding header field." Use CVE-2015-5741 for one or more
internal discoveries reflected in
300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f.

Finally, if there is a code change in
300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f that is exclusively for the
purposes of hardening (i.e., no RFC requires the change as a smuggling
security fix, and the code change is not for addressing an
individually exploitable problem), then that code change is outside
the scope of CVE.

# RHSA-2016:1538 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: golang security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1538)

## Topic

An update for golang is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The golang packages provide the Go programming language compiler.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: golang (1.6.3). (BZ#1346331)

Security Fix(es):

* An input-validation flaw was discovered in the Go programming language built in CGI implementation, which set the environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" using the incoming "Proxy" HTTP-request header. The environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. (CVE-2016-5386)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.

This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-10-13 08:59:53 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:27:25 UTC  ``` Dominic Scheirlinck of VendHQ reports:  Many software projects and vendors have implemented support for the “Proxy” request header in their respective CGI implementations and languages by creating the “HTTP_PROXY” environmental variable based on the header value. When this variable is used (in many cases automatically by various HTTP client libraries) any outgoing requests generated in turn from the attackers original request can be redirected to an attacker controlled proxy. This allows attackers to view potentially sensitive information, reply with malformed data, or to hold connections open causing a potential denial of service.   The Go programming language can automatically populate the HTTP_PROXY environmental variable with a user supplied "Proxy" header.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:27:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Scott Geary (VendHQ)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c2)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-08 05:49:05 UTC  ``` To go package "net/http" honours $HTTP_PROXY as well as $http_proxy when making outbound requests, making CGI programs written in go vulnerable.  Go HTTP servers that do not invoke CGI scripts are not directly vulnerable:    - the HTTP_PROXY var is not set in the server process's environment   - the HTTP_PROXY var is not set in subprocesses launched directly by os.exec   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-07-18 15:35:24 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1357601](show_bug.cgi?id=1357601 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5386 golang: Go: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1357602](show_bug.cgi?id=1357602 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5386 golang: Go: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c8)  Summer Long    2016-07-26 00:52:17 UTC  ``` Upstream announcement on golang-announce mailing list:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-announce/7jZDOQ8f8tM>  [security] Go 1.6.3 and 1.7rc2 are released  Chris Broadfoot 	 Jul 19  A security-related issue was recently reported in Go's net/http/cgi package and net/http package when used in a CGI environment. Go 1.6.3 and Go 1.7rc2 will contain a fix for this issue.  Go versions 1.0-1.6.2 and 1.7rc1 are vulnerable to an input validation flaw in the CGI components resulting in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable being set by the incoming Proxy header. This environment variable was also used to set the outgoing proxy, enabling an attacker to insert a proxy into outgoing requests of a CGI program.  This is [CVE-2016-5386](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5386) and was addressed by this change: <https://golang.org/cl/25010>, tracked in this issue: <https://golang.org/issue/16405>  The Go team would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck for coordinating disclosure of this issue across multiple languages and CGI environments. Read more about "httpoxy" here: <https://httpoxy.org/>  Go 1.6.3 also adds support for macOS Sierra. See <https://golang.org/issue/16354> for details.  Downloads are available at <https://golang.org/dl> for all supported platforms.  Cheers, Chris (on behalf of the Go team)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c13)  Fedora Update System    2016-07-28 23:54:27 UTC  ``` golang-1.6.3-1.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.

# CVE Request - Go net/http library - HTTP smuggling

---

*From*: Jason Buberel <jbuberel () google com>

```
Hello OSS Security Community,

The Go open source project has received notification of an HTTP request
smuggling vulnerability in the net/http library (
<http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/>). The vulnerability was identified in the
1.4.2 release version (<http://golang.org/dl>) and in the 1.5 release branch.

Patches have already been applied to the 1.5 release branch, and will be
ported to the 1.4.2 release branch. We will then create a 1.4.3 release.

We are requesting a CVE ID in order to coordinate updates with
distributions that include binary packages for the Go programming language.
We will also announce and request that all Go programs using the net/http
package that were compiled with version 1.4.2 or earlier be recompiled with
1.4.3 or 1.5 (when released) due to the static linking nature of the Go
toolchain.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Regards,
Jason Buberel
Product Manager, Go
Google, Inc.

```

```
Florian,

We believe that this is a potentially exploitable issue.  We would like a
CVE-ID in order to release a 1.4.3 build that has the fixes applied to the
current stable release (1.4.2) for linux distro coordination.

Commits have been made to the Go master branch to fix the problem:

<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/117ddcb83d7f42d6aa72241240af99ded81118e9>
<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/300d9a21583e7cf0149a778a0611e76ff7c6680f>
<https://github.com/golang/go/commit/143822585e32449860e624cace9d2e521deee62e>

Additional background on the exploit, as provided by the reporter:

net/http problems
------------------

* Double Content-length headers in a request does not generate a 400 error,
the second Content-length is ignored
* Invalid headers are parsed as valid headers (like "Content Length:" with a
space in the middle)

Exploitations
--------------

In a situation where the net/http agent HTTP communication with the final
http clients is using some reverse proxy (reverse proxy cache, SSL
terminators, etc), some requests can be made exploiting the net/http HTTP
protocol violations.

The goal of theses requests will be either:
 * to bypass security controls on theses previous elements
 * to perform some cache poisoning on these elements
 * to alter the request/response map on these previous elements (for DOS),
see for example this apache 2.4 issue:
<https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57832>
