  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-5292",
    "description": "It was found that SSSD's Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder plug-in would leak a small amount of memory on each authentication request. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system by making repeated requests to a Kerberized daemon application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.",
    "root_cause": "The sssd_pac_plugin (sssd_pac_plugin.so library) had a memory leak. The krb5_pac_parse function allocated memory for the PAC, but the sssdpac_verify function did not free it after use, resulting in a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially exhaust all available memory on the system by making repeated authentication requests to a Kerberized daemon application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: Attacker sends repeated authentication requests to the vulnerable Kerberized daemon application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the Kerberized daemon application. No authentication or special privileges are required."
