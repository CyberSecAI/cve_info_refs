- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Access Manager appliance stores obfuscated passwords in plain-text configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Obfuscated plaintext passwords are stored in configuration files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated users can access the configuration files, potentially exposing the obfuscated passwords. Although obfuscated, the passwords might be recoverable.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the appliance by authenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM Security Access Manager appliance.
