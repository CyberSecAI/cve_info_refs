Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper URL whitelist enforcement in the Auction Camera application. The application, built using "applican", allows loading of arbitrary pages when launched via a URL scheme, bypassing intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **URL Whitelist Bypass:** The application fails to properly validate URLs accessed through the URL scheme, allowing arbitrary page loading.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The application does not restrict which APIs can be called via URL scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Android:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary "applican" APIs if those APIs have been granted permission in the Android manifest of the app.
*   **iOS:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary APIs used by the iOS application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL scheme.
* An attacker can craft a malicious URL and induce a user to click on it, which will then launch the vulnerable application and perform the desired action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
* The attacker needs to induce a user to click the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The application is vulnerable on both Android and iOS platforms.
*   The iOS version is no longer being maintained, and users are advised to uninstall it.
*   The Android version has a fix available in version 1.2 or higher.
*  The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS base score of 6.8.
* The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability and released a fix for the Android application.
