- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - Unvalidated Redirect: The `returnURL` parameter in the `/dev/build` URL is vulnerable to manipulation by supplying a malicious file location.
    - XSS (reflected): The `install.php` script is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `admin_username` and `admin_password` POST parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unvalidated Redirect: The application fails to properly validate the `returnURL` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary locations.
    - XSS (reflected): The application fails to sanitize user input in `admin_username` and `admin_password` fields, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts which are then reflected in the browser of the victim.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unvalidated Redirect: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site, potentially for phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
    - XSS (reflected): An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Unvalidated Redirect: A crafted URL containing a malicious value in the `returnURL` parameter.
    - XSS (reflected): A POST request to `install.php` with malicious input in the `admin_username` or `admin_password` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to craft URLs or POST requests. No special privileges are required.
