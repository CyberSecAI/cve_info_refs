Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak comparison (`!==`) when checking the hash key of widgets within the WordPress Customizer. This weak comparison is susceptible to timing side-channel attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Side-Channel Attack:** The use of `!==` for comparing hash keys makes the comparison time dependent on the number of matching characters. This allows a malicious actor to potentially infer information about the hash key by measuring the time taken for the comparison, allowing them to bypass security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to bypass the widget hash key check and possibly manipulate widget data or other aspects of the Customizer. The impact is further amplified by the ability to bypass security measures, allowing for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the manipulation of widget data within the WordPress Customizer in such a way as to exploit the timing difference in the comparison of hashes.
- This vulnerability is exploitable through the Customizer interface of WordPress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WordPress Customizer. This generally requires user authentication, but if the Customizer is exposed improperly it could be exposed to unauthenticated users.
- The attacker requires the ability to modify, or attempt to modify, widget data.
- The attacker would need to measure the time taken for the hash comparison, indicating they have some level of access to server responses, or their processing times.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involves replacing the `!==` operator with the `hash_equals()` function. `hash_equals()` performs a constant-time comparison, which mitigates the timing side-channel attack by not revealing information through comparison times. The code change is reflected in the following snippet:

```
This change ensures that the comparison doesn't leak timing information, effectively closing the side-channel.
