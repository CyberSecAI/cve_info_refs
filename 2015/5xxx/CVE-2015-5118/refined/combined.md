## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-16
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-3117, CVE-2015-3118, CVE-2015-3119, CVE-2015-3120,
CVE-2015-3121, CVE-2015-3122, CVE-2015-3123, CVE-2015-3124, CVE-2015-3126,
CVE-2015-3127, CVE-2015-3128, CVE-2015-3129, CVE-2015-3130, CVE-2015-3131,
CVE-2015-3132, CVE-2015-3133, CVE-2015-3134, CVE-2015-3135, CVE-2015-3136,
CVE-2015-3137, CVE-2015-4428, CVE-2015-4429, CVE-2015-4430, CVE-2015-4431,
CVE-2015-4432, CVE-2015-4433, CVE-2015-5117, CVE-2015-5118, CVE-2015-5119)

Multiple security bypass flaws were found in flash-plugin that could lead
to the disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0578, CVE-2015-3114,
CVE-2015-3115, CVE-2015-3116, CVE-2015-3125, CVE-2015-5116)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.481.
