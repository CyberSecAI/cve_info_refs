Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetAppÂ® products contain the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd). The Open NTP project (www.ntp.org) has released a Security Notice regarding vulnerabilities that affect versions before ntp-4.2.8p4. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify data, execute arbitrary code, cause a process crash or Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to data modification, arbitrary code execution, process crashes or Denial of Service (DoS).

Clustered Data ONTAP and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode were only found to be affected by CVE-2015-5300, CVE-2015-7704, and CVE-2015-7705.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

## Overview

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9

Red Hat understands the importance of life cycle planning for our customers, partners, ISVs, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem. With the introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8, Red Hat simplified the RHEL product phases from four to three: Full Support, Maintenance Support, and Extended Life Phase. We are also providing information on anticipated release dates and minor releases that will offer extended support.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9 delivers a ten year life cycle in Full Support and Maintenance Support Phases followed by an Extended Life Phase. In addition, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 customers may purchase annual Add-on subscriptions called Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) to extend limited subscription services beyond the Maintenance Support Phase.

#### Life Cycle[viii](#viii):

![](/sites/default/files/images/355_rhel_life_cycle_updates_0723_2.png)

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle phases are designed to reduce the level of change within each major release[i](#i) over time and make release availability and content more predictable.[ii](#ii)

## Details

During the life cycle for each major version, software changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux are delivered via individual updates known as *errata advisories* through the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home)[iii](#iii) or other authorized Red Hat portals. Errata advisories may be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated as a minor release. Errata advisories will contain security fixes (Red Hat Security Advisories or RHSAs), bug fixes (Red Hat Bug Fix Advisories or RHBAs), or feature enhancements (Red Hat Enhancement Advisories or RHEAs). Errata advisories are tested and qualified against the active Red Hat Enterprise Linux major release. (For example, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 RHSA will be applied cumulatively to the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 version and patch set.) Released errata advisories remain accessible to active subscribers for the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Within each major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any errata advisory (including one released as part of a minor release) will be applied cumulatively to the latest release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including any patch sets.

During the life cycle of a major Red Hat Enterprise Linux release, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain binary compatibility for the core runtime environment across all minor releases and errata advisories. If necessary, Red Hat may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for Critical impact security or other significant issues. Furthermore, major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux contain a limited set of backward-compatible libraries included in previous major releases to allow for the easy migration of applications. Typically, Red Hat applies changes in such a way as to minimize the amount of change and to maintain binary compatibility. Exceptions may apply for controlled package re-bases under certain circumstances. The binary compatibility goal is extended to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for use in an application container. Additional details can be found in the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility), or the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility).

The following table details the subscription services, including support and software maintenance, performed during each phase of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle:

1. Technical Support access depends on the Service Level included in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription.
2. Red Hat may choose, as a temporary measure, to address those catastrophic issues with a significant customer business impact with a Hotfix while the Bug Fix errata advisory (RHBA) is being created.
3. Native hardware enablement is provided by backporting hardware drivers, etc., to the relevant version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hardware enablement using virtualization is achieved by running an earlier version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a virtual guest on a newer version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See the [Virtualization](#Virtualization) description below for details. NOTE: Hardware certification (including the associated hardware limits) applies to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that is being used as the host.
4. Intentionally left blank.
5. Software enhancements are additions of new functionality beyond correcting defects or enabling previously existing functionality on a new hardware generation.
6. Major releases are the primary vehicle for significant software enhancements, although low-impact software enhancement may also be delivered in minor releases.
7. See the [Extended Life Phase](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) description below.
8. Extended Update Support (EUS), Enhanced Extended Update Support (Enhanced EUS), and Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) are available as optional add-ons. See the [EUS](#Extended_Update_Support), [Enhanced EUS,](#Enhanced_Extended_Update_Support) and [ELS](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Support) descriptions below.
9. For existing installations only. See details [below](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) for other limitations.
10. See the [Issue Severity Classification](/site/security/updates/classification/) page for security severity classifications.
11. All errata provided at Red Hat's discretion.

14. Updated installation image provided at first minor release GA date.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Production Phases

### Full Support Phase[iv](#iv):

During the Full Support Phase, [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important Security errata advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent and Selected (at Red Hat discretion) High Priority Bug Fix errata advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

If available, new or improved hardware enablement and select enhanced software functionality may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat, generally in minor releases. Hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided independent from minor releases at Red Hat's discretion.

Minor releases will also include available and qualified errata advisories (RHSAs, RHBAs, and RHEAs). Minor releases are cumulative and include the contents of previously released updates. The focus for minor releases during this phase lies on resolving defects of medium or higher priority.

Updated installation images will be provided for minor releases during the Full Support Phase.

### Maintenance Support Phase :

During the Maintenance Support Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 & 9 [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

New functionality and new hardware enablement are not planned for availability in the Maintenance Support Phase.

### Extended Life Phase:

During the Extended Life Phase, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription provides continued access to previously released content on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home), as well as other content such as documentation and the Red Hat Knowledgebase. Advice for migrating to currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions may also be provided.

For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.

Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the Extended Life Phase for a particular version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at any time.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle Red Hat is providing further predictability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers, partners, and ISVs. The below map provides details on when minor releases are planned, and which minor releases will include Extended Update Support and Update Services for SAP Solutions. Minor releases are planned for release every six months through the Full Support phase. RHEL 8 Planning Guide[viii](#viii) RHEL 9 Planning Guide[viii](#viii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle

The vast majority of packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 & 9, including most Application Streams, will be maintained for the full 10 year Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Specified life cycle components, however, will be maintained for less than 10 years, with a specified life cycle often matching the upstream life of the component.

Application Streams will adhere to the errata criteria for the Production Phase of the major release. For example, errata released for an Application Stream for RHEL 8 or 9 during the Maintenance Support Phase will be confined to [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs). Similarly, no new Application Streams will be released during the Maintenance Support Phase and Extended Life Phase since Software Enhancements are not permitted during these phases. However, to achieve the 10 years support criteria for RHEL, one version of each Application Stream will be identified at the start of the Maintenance Support Phase and that version will receive maintenance as described by the support phases.

For example, most databases are supported upstream for 5 years and maintenance of their Application Stream in RHEL 8 or 9 will align with their upstream support. There will be overlapping PostgreSQL Application Streams in RHEL 8, with each stream maintained for 5 years. Customers may select the Application Stream version that best meets their needs. They can install an older version, install a newer version and stay on it for the full 5 years, or update to the latest stream with each release, whatever best fits their use case. Customers never have to update, they can update at their own convenience. If a customer asks for support beyond the specified life of an Application Stream, they may be asked to move to a newer Application Stream to take advantage of bug fixes and CVE advisories.

Please see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle](/support/policy/updates/rhel-app-streams-life-cycle) page for more information.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Maintenance

### Extended Update Support Add-on[vii](#vii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 EUS Maintenance Policy; and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 EUS/Enhanced EUS Maintenance Policy

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Extended Update Support maintenance policy; and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Extended Update Support/Enhanced Extended Update Support maintenance policy consist of addressing (a) security related issues for active software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 & 9, and (b) Urgent bugs for a specified list of packages as detailed below.

#### Security Maintenance

* Red Hat may provide security fixes for [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important CVEs for packages within Red Hat Enterprise Linux as long as the package is not in end of life.
* Packages within RHEL 8 or 9 Application Streams may have a shorter life cycle than a specific RHEL minor release

+ Please refer to the Application Streams life cycle section for more details

* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle policy
* Definition of Critical and Important Impact CVEs is defined by the [Red Hat Security Policy](/security/updates/classification)

#### Bug Fix Maintenance

* The inclusions list below is a minimum set of packages that apply to Urgent bug fixes.

+ bind, bash, chrony, grub2, grubby, glibc, gnutls, httpd, kernel, libgcrypt, libvirt, nss, openssh, openssl, python 3.6 (RHEL 8), python 3.9 (RHEL 9), qemu-kvm, rpm, sudo, systemd, wget, yum / dnf

* Urgent bugs not on the list may be addressed at Red Hat discretion.
* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise LInux Life Cycle Policy.

**Note:** Active minor releases refers to the period of time a specific minor release is maintained. For example, RHEL 9.0 with EUS is active for 24 months from general availability.

### Update Services for SAP Solutions Red Hat offers Update Services for SAP Solutions (E4S) on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions subscription for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period of time. The Update Services for SAP Solutions allows customers the flexibility to decide when to take advantage of new Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, including new hardware enablement. Under a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, all available RHSAs and RHBAs are provided for the current active minor release until the availability of the next minor release. By contrast, EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions deliver—for a specific minor release—an independent, extended stream of those [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority RHBAs that are available after that specific minor release and in parallel to subsequent minor releases. For EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions subscribers, Red Hat generally will continue to proactively provide [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs independent of customer requests if and when available.

### Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

### RHEL 6 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**RHEL 6 ELS Inclusion List**](/articles/4997301).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture, both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Add-Ons are not covered by ELS.

For guidance on how to best modernize your Red Hat infrastructure with a solution that meets your business needs, contact Red Hat Consulting.

**Note:** Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

### RHEL 7 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support Maintenance Policy.**](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhel7-els-support-maintenance-policy).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture (64-bit only). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support also includes maintenance for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability add-on, and the Resilient Storage add-on.

Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

**Note:** RHEL ELS should be purchased before the start date of the ELS period (June 30, 2024 for RHEL 7 ELS). Otherwise, the ELS Add-on subscription must be back-dated to the RHEL ELS period start date

## Virtualization

Virtualization provides hardware abstraction for guest operating systems. Abstraction allows a guest that is running an older version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that does not support the latest server hardware to be easily deployed on a virtualization host that does. In this way, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 guest can be hosted by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on a latest-generation processor.

Red Hat intends to support those versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that are still within the Production or Extended Life Phase when run as virtualized guests on later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The [Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization support matrix](http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/articles/enterprise-linux-virtualization-support) provides details on the supported combinations of operating systems, versions, and hardware architectures.

# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Access Manager for Web is affected by NTP vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-5300, CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-8138)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with a referenced time source.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-5300](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5300) **DESCRIPTION:** Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to correctly implement the threshold limitation for the '-g' option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept NTP traffic and make multiple steps larger than the panic threshold.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107594> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

#### Description

If `ntpd` is always started with the `-g` option, which is common and against long-standing recommendation, and if at the moment `ntpd` is restarted an attacker can immediately respond to enough requests from enough sources trusted by the target, which is difficult and not common, there is a window of opportunity where the attacker can cause `ntpd` to set the time to an arbitrary value. Similarly, if an attacker is able to respond to enough requests from enough sources trusted by the target, the attacker can cause `ntpd` to abort and restart, at which point it can tell the target to set the time to an arbitrary value if and only if `ntpd` was re-started against long-standing recommendation with the `-g` flag, or if `ntpd` was not given the `-g` flag, the attacker can move the target system’s time by at most 900 seconds' time per attack.

---

#### Mitigation

* Configure `ntpd` to get time from multiple sources.
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p5 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* As we’ve long documented, only use the `-g` option to `ntpd` in cold-start situations.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-16:02.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: ntp panic threshold bypass vulnerability
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2016-01-14
Credits: Network Time Foundation
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2016-01-11 01:09:50 UTC (stable/10, 10.2-STABLE)
2016-01-14 09:10:46 UTC (releng/10.2, 10.2-RELEASE-p9)
2016-01-14 09:11:16 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p26)
2016-01-11 01:48:16 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)
2016-01-14 09:11:26 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p33)
CVE Name: CVE-2015-5300
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
The ntpd(8) daemon has a safety feature to prevent excessive stepping of
the clock called the "panic threshold". If ever ntpd(8) determines the
system clock is incorrect by more than this threshold, the daemon exits.
There is an implementation error within the ntpd(8) implementation of this
feature, which allows the system time be adjusted in certain circumstances.
III. Impact
When ntpd(8) is started with the '-g' option specified, the system time will
be corrected regardless of if the time offset exceeds the panic threshold (by
default, 1000 seconds). The FreeBSD rc(8) subsystem allows specifying the
'-g' option by either including '-g' in the ntpd\_flags list or by enabling
ntpd\_sync\_on\_start in the system rc.conf(5) file.
If at the moment ntpd(8) is restarted, an attacker can immediately respond to
enough requests from enough sources trusted by the target, which is difficult
and not common, there is a window of opportunity where the attacker can cause
ntpd(8) to set the time to an arbitrary value.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8), or running
ntpd(8) but do not use ntpd\_sync\_on\_start="YES" or specify the '-g' option in
ntpd\_flags are not affected. Neither of these are set by default.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.1 and 10.2]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:02/ntp-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:02/ntp-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:02/ntp-9.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:02/ntp-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-9.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is
now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p6 to fix 12 security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).
- CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin (bsc#962997).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:34:45 UTC  ``` It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:  -g   Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the thresh‐ old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for other options.  ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by attackers to expire certificates, etc.  This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082271](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=diff "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=edit "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [CVE-2015-5300](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5300) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:39:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:40:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274166](show_bug.cgi?id=1274166 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2015-5300 ntp: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger than the panic threshold [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is
now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p6 to fix 12 security issues.
Also yast2-ntp-client was updated to match some sntp syntax changes.
(bsc#937837)
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).
- CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin (bsc#962997).
- CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker could have forced ntpd to make a step
larger than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2956#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2015-11-02 03:01:29 UTC  ``` The BU paper from Sharon Goldberg and her team talks about an attack they called small-step/big-step.  Originally, this attack was thought to only be an issue for some versions of NTP that went thru 4.2.6pX, and 4.2.8 was not affected.  Just before 4.2.8p4 was release, it was discovered that there was a fairly small window of opportunity just after 4.2.8 was started where it could be similarly attacked. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2956#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2015-11-04 09:00:48 UTC  ``` The fix for this will be in 4.3.78 and 4.2.8p5. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2956#c2)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-11-04 14:04:36 UTC  ``` Harlan, I spent some time thinking about the right location where to reset the 'allow_panic' flag. IMHO it would be better to do it when the step actually occurs, in the default branch around line 640 of ntp_loopfilter.c.  There are several places where the function is left early, and it might be better to keep the panic gate disarmed until a step really took place or the box is sync'd. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2956#c3)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-11-04 19:30:53 UTC  ``` And after some more time I can see where this would leave a gap. Forget my previous comment. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2956#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2015-11-30 08:30:51 UTC  ``` Miroslav wrote:  FWIW, our security team set the score for this issue to cvss2=4.3/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1930)

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps
in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the
client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization
with the server. (CVE-2015-7704)

It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the threshold limitation
for the '-g' option, which is used to set the time without any
restrictions. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to intercept NTP traffic
between a connecting client and an NTP server could use this flaw to force
that client to make multiple steps larger than the panic threshold,
effectively changing the time to an arbitrary value. (CVE-2015-5300)

Red Hat would like to thank Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon
Goldberg of Boston University for reporting these issues.

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:34:45 UTC  ``` It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:  -g   Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the thresh‐ old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for other options.  ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by attackers to expire certificates, etc.  This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082271](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=diff "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=edit "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [CVE-2015-5300](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5300) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:39:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:40:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274166](show_bug.cgi?id=1274166 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2015-5300 ntp: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger than the panic threshold [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

- CVE-2015-7701: Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7703: configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile" should
only be allowed locally (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705: Clients that receive a KoD should validate
the origin timestamp field (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data
packet length checks (bsc#951608).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
- Add a controlkey line to /etc/ntp.conf if one does not already exist to
allow runtime configuuration via ntpq.
- bsc#946386: Temporarily disable memlock to avoid problems due to high
memory usage during name resolution.
- bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- Fix legacy action scripts to pass on command line arguments.
- bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
- bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
- Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
- Disable mode 7 (ntpdc) again, now that we don't use it anymore.
- Add "addserver" as a new legacy action.
- bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
- bsc#926510: Disable chroot by default.
- bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.
- bsc#784760: Remove local clock from default configuration.
- bsc#942441/fate#319496: Require perl-Socket6.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- bsc#920183: Allow -4 and -6 address qualifiers in "server" directives.
- Use upstream ntp-wait, because our version is incompatible with the new
ntpq command line syntax.

[CVE-2015-5300 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5300)

#### Description

The panic\_gate check in NTP before 4.2.8p5 is only re-enabled after the first change to the system clock that was greater than 128 milliseconds by default, which allows remote attackers to set NTP to an arbitrary time when started with the -g option, or to alter the time by up to 900 seconds otherwise by responding to an unspecified number of requests from trusted sources, and leveraging a resulting denial of service (abort and restart).

An update that solves 28 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p6 to fix 28 security issues.
Major functional changes:
- The "sntp" commandline tool changed its option handling in a major way,
some options have been renamed or dropped.
- "controlkey 1" is added during update to ntp.conf to allow sntp to work.
- The local clock is being disabled during update.
- ntpd is no longer running chrooted.
Other functional changes:
- ntp-signd is installed.
- "enable mode7" can be added to the configuration to allow ntdpc to work
as compatibility mode option.
- "kod" was removed from the default restrictions.
- SHA1 keys are used by default instead of MD5 keys.
Also yast2-ntp-client was updated to match some sntp syntax changes.
(bsc#937837)
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).
- CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin (bsc#962997).
- CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker could have forced ntpd to make a step
larger than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
- CVE-2015-7871: NAK to the Future: Symmetric association authentication
bypass via crypto-NAK (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7855: decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning

- CVE-2015-7854: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7853: Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock driver
could cause a buffer overflow (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7852: ntpq atoascii() Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7851: saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability (bsc#951608).

- CVE-2015-7848: mode 7 loop counter underrun (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7701: Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7703: configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile" should
only be allowed locally (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705: Clients that receive a KoD should validate
the origin timestamp field (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data
packet length checks (bsc#951608).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
- Add a controlkey line to /etc/ntp.conf if one does not already exist to
allow runtime configuuration via ntpq.
- bsc#946386: Temporarily disable memlock to avoid problems due to high
memory usage during name resolution.
- bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- Fix legacy action scripts to pass on command line arguments.
- bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
- bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
- Add a controlkey to ntp.conf to make the above work.
- Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
- Disable mode 7 (ntpdc) again, now that we don't use it anymore.
- Add "addserver" as a new legacy action.
- bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
- bsc#926510: Disable chroot by default.
- bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.

***The Security of the Network Time Protocol***

**Boston University**

Time is a fundamental building block for computing applications, and is heavily utilized by many cryptographic protocols (eg. [digital certificates and TLS](https://www.thawte.com/resources/getting-started/ssl-faq/%22),
[bitcoin](http://culubas.blogspot.com/2011/05/timejacking-bitcoin_802.html),
[authentication with Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29), [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions), etc). Time on computer clocks is commonly set using the Network Time Protocol ([NTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5905.txt)). This project considers the security of NTP, and its [specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905), and its reference implementation [ntpd](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). We consider various threats to NTP that allow an attacker to either (a) alter time on computer systems that set their clocks using NTP (timeshifting attacks), or (b) prevent those systems from synchronizing their clocks (denial of service attacks). We are also designing protocols that can secure NTP against these attacks.

## Affected Products and Versions

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

## Remediation/Fixes

Apply an interim fix, according to the table below.Interim fixes are associated with the original APAR that is documented in the table. Because these APAR references might be updated to more recent APARs, see the links in the table for the most recent interim fix information.

This interim fix contains a new default SSL certificate, as the previous default SSL certificate, which was never intended for production use, has an MD5 signature and is no longer compatible with Java. The result is that installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere Datapower XC10 appliances that are running with an MD5 certificate, including the default SSL certificate that was shipped prior to this interim fix. If the appliance is configured with a custom keystore and certificate with an MD5 signature, it must be replaced prior to upgrading to this interim fix or the 'clear-tls-config' command must be run on the appliance before or after performing the upgrade. Failing to do so will result in the appliance failing to start. Note that changing the active certificate for an appliance collective does require that the cache be reloaded and client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.

| *Product* | *Version* | *APAR* | *Link to interim fix* |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is
now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p6 to fix 12 security issues.
Also yast2-ntp-client was updated to match some sntp syntax changes.
(bsc#937837)
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).
- CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin (bsc#962997).
- CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker could have forced ntpd to make a step
larger than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.

An update that solves 43 vulnerabilities and has 9 fixes is
now available.
Description:
NTP was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix several security issues and to
ensure the continued maintainability of the package.
These security issues were fixed:
\* CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilized ephemeral associations
(bsc#982065).
\* CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).
\* CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).

\* CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO\_NAK crash (bsc#982064).
\* CVE-2016-1547: Validate crypto-NAKs to prevent ACRYPTO-NAK DoS
(bsc#977459).
\* CVE-2016-1548: Prevent the change of time of an ntpd client or
denying service to an ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic
client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode (bsc#977461).
\* CVE-2016-1549: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack
(bsc#977451).
\* CVE-2016-1550: Improve security against buffer comparison timing
attacks (bsc#977464).
\* CVE-2016-1551: Refclock impersonation vulnerability (bsc#977450)y
\* CVE-2016-2516: Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives could have
caused an assertion botch in ntpd (bsc#977452).
\* CVE-2016-2517: Remote configuration trustedkey/
requestkey/controlkey values are not properly validated (bsc#977455).
\* CVE-2016-2518: Crafted addpeer with hmode > 7 causes array
wraparound with MATCH\_ASSOC (bsc#977457).
\* CVE-2016-2519: ctl\_getitem() return value not always checked
(bsc#977458).
\* CVE-2015-8158: Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
\* CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
\* CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on

\* CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allowed dangerous characters
in filenames (bsc#962802).
\* CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
\* CVE-2015-7974: NTP did not verify peer associations of symmetric
keys when authenticating packets, which might have allowed remote
attackers to conduct impersonation attacks via an arbitrary trusted
key, aka a "skeleton" key (bsc#962960).
\* CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
\* CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger
than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
\* CVE-2015-5194: Crash with crafted logconfig configuration command
(bsc#943218).
\* CVE-2015-7871: NAK to the Future: Symmetric association
authentication bypass via crypto-NAK (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7855: decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning
FAIL on some bogus values (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7854: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7853: Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock
driver could cause a buffer overflow (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7852: ntpq atoascii() Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7851: saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7850: Clients that receive a KoD now validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7849: Prevent use-after-free trusted key (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7848: Prevent mode 7 loop counter underrun (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7701: Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7703: Configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile"
should only be allowed locally (bsc#943221).
\* CVE-2015-7704: Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7705: Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7691: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7692: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-1798: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP required a correct MAC only if the MAC
field has a nonzero length, which made it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof packets by omitting the MAC
(bsc#924202).
\* CVE-2015-1799: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP performed state-variable updates upon
receiving certain invalid packets, which made it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service
(synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer
(bsc#924202).
These non-security issues were fixed:
\* Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the
parent returns.
\* bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker
process to avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
\* bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().
\* Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1,
which is needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".
\* bsc#957226: Restrict the parser in the startup script to the first
occurrance of "keys" and "controlkey" in ntp.conf.
\* Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP (--enable-ntp-signd)
\* bsc#975496: Fix ntp-sntp-dst.patch.
\* bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path,
which caused the synchronization to fail.
\* bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
\* bsc#951559: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
\* bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
\* bsc#951351: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might
happen quite a lot on loaded systems.
\* Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
\* bnc#784760: Remove local clock from default configuration.
\* Fix incomplete backporting of "rcntp ntptimemset".
\* bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
\* Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
\* bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
\* bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
\* bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
\* bsc#926510: Re-add chroot support, but mark it as deprecated and
disable it by default.
\* bsc#920895: Drop support for running chrooted, because it is an
ongoing source of problems and not really needed anymore, given that
ntp now drops privileges and runs under apparmor.
\* bsc#920183: Allow -4 and -6 address qualifiers in "server"
directives.
\* Use upstream ntp-wait, because our version is incompatible with the
new ntpq command line syntax.
\* bsc#920905: Adjust Util.pm to the Perl version on SLE11.
\* bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.
\* bsc#920893: Don't use %exclude.
\* bsc#988417: Default to NTPD\_FORCE\_SYNC\_ON\_STARTUP="yes"
\* bsc#988565: Ignore errors when removing extra files during
uninstallation
\* bsc#988558: Don't blindly guess the value to use for IP\_TOS

ICS Advisory
# Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX-based Devices NTP Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-356-01

## OVERVIEW

Siemens has reported to NCCIC/ICS-CERT that NTP daemon vulnerabilities exist in the Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX-based devices. Siemens has produced firmware updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX versions are affected when NTP service is activated:

* ROX II: All versions prior to 2.9.0, and
* ROX I: All versions.

The NTP service is deactivated on ROX I and ROX II-based devices by default.

## IMPACT

An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could cause the NTP daemon to accept malicious time updates, prevent it from receiving updates, or crash.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Siemens is an international company headquartered in Munich, Germany.

The affected products, Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX-based devices, are used to connect devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets. According to Siemens, RUGGEDCOM ROX-based devices are deployed across several sectors including Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, and Transportation Systems. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

The NTP service is deactivated on ROX I and ROX II-based devices by default.

Siemens provides firmware update V2.9.0 for ROX II-based devices to mitigate the vulnerabilities. To obtain the firmware update, please contact Siemens support at:

<http://www.siemens.com/automation/support-request>

or a local hotline center:

<http://www.automation.siemens.com/mcms/aspa-db/en/automationtechnology/Pages/default.aspx>

For ROX I-based devices and ROX II versions before ROX 2.9.0, Siemens recommends implementing the following mitigations:

* Block NTP packets from unknown peers using firewall rules.
* Employ NTP time synchronization in trusted network only.
* Ensure that the NTP configuration file contains the “noquery” flag for all nonlocal restrict statements, or deactivate NTP service if the functionality is not required.

For more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-472334 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories/>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:34:45 UTC  ``` It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:  -g   Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the thresh‐ old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for other options.  ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by attackers to expire certificates, etc.  This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082271](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=diff "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=edit "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [CVE-2015-5300](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5300) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:39:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:40:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274166](show_bug.cgi?id=1274166 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2015-5300 ntp: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger than the panic threshold [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

## Details

Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain remote

config packets. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated

attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in

a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5146](/security/CVE-2015-5146))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logconfig

directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5194](/security/CVE-2015-5194))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain statistics

types. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5195](/security/CVE-2015-5195))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain file

paths. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service, or overwrite certain files. ([CVE-2015-5196](/security/CVE-2015-5196), [CVE-2015-7703](/security/CVE-2015-7703))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to hang,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5219](/security/CVE-2015-5219))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP

incorrectly handled restarting after hitting a panic threshold. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to alter the system time on clients.

([CVE-2015-5300](/security/CVE-2015-5300))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled autokey data packets. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-7691](/security/CVE-2015-7691), [CVE-2015-7692](/security/CVE-2015-7692), [CVE-2015-7702](/security/CVE-2015-7702))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing

certain autokey messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to cause NTP to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-7701](/security/CVE-2015-7701))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP

incorrectly handled rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to cause clients to stop updating their clock. ([CVE-2015-7704](/security/CVE-2015-7704),

[CVE-2015-7705](/security/CVE-2015-7705))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logfile and keyfile

directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to enter a loop, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7850](/security/CVE-2015-7850))

Yves Younan and Aleksander Nikolich discovered that NTP incorrectly handled

ascii conversion. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7852](/security/CVE-2015-7852))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled reference clock memory.

A malicious refclock could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-7853](/security/CVE-2015-7853))

John D "Doug" Birdwell discovered that NTP incorrectly handled decoding

certain bogus values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7855](/security/CVE-2015-7855))

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled symmetric association

authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly bypass

authentication and alter the system clock. ([CVE-2015-7871](/security/CVE-2015-7871))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP

AppArmor profile.

# CVE-2015-1799

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1798.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1802.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1799 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1799)

#### Description

The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain invalid packets, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer.

# CVE-2015-1798

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-1797.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-1799.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-1798 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1798)

#### Description

The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p2 requires a correct MAC only if the MAC field has a nonzero length, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof packets by omitting the MAC.
