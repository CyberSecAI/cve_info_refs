Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the Zenphoto admin interface combined with the ability to execute arbitrary functions via the `admin.php?action=` parameter. Specifically, the `action=ingres_connect` function allows an attacker to trigger connections to a remote Ingres database specified by the victim. If some parameters are missing, `ingres_connect()` uses values from the `php.ini` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into making unwanted actions.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** While not a direct SSRF, the ability to force connections to a remote Ingres database leads to SSRF characteristics. An attacker can manipulate the server to connect to an arbitrary remote server.
- **Unrestricted Function Execution:** The `admin.php?action=` parameter enables execution of various functions, some of which can lead to denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the `ingres_connect` function with multiple connections to a remote database, the attacker can cause a DoS by exhausting server resources.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Although not mentioned, the `ingres_connect` function, in some configurations, could potentially lead to information disclosure (e.g., revealing database connection strings in php.ini).
- **CSRF Actions**: Allows arbitrary actions through the admin interface if the victim is logged in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a CSRF attack using a malicious link or form that a logged-in administrator would inadvertently access.
- The attacker would construct a crafted URL or HTML form that forces the victim's browser to send a request to the vulnerable `admin.php?action=ingres_connect` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious link or open a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker does not need any privileges or specific permissions within the Zenphoto application. They need to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and action to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly states that the intentional call to `admin.php?action=` doesn't cross privilege boundaries because it requires the attacker to be an admin. However, the CSRF aspect does allow for an external attacker to cause the administrator to unintentionally perform an action.
- This vulnerability is not related to any issues with privilege boundaries or authentication bypass.
- The information on this vulnerability is more detailed than the original CVE description, providing more context for the vulnerability.
