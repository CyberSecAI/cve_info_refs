Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper recycling of the `requestedSessionSSL` field within the `Request` object in Apache Tomcat. When a request object was recycled for a new request, this field, which is used to store the session ID, was not reset. This allowed the session ID from a previous request to be used in a new request, giving the client control over the session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is a session fixation issue where an attacker could potentially reuse an established session ID in subsequent requests.
*   **Lack of Proper Resource Management:** The failure to properly recycle the `requestedSessionSSL` field after each request leads to unintended state persistence.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking (Theoretical):** While practically difficult, the vulnerability could theoretically enable session hijacking where an attacker, by manipulating the session ID, could impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability, when combined with other misconfigurations (such as enabling the usage of SSL session IDs as HTTP session IDs) can lead to the exposure of session IDs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, though exploitation requires specific conditions to be met.
*  **Recycled Request Object:** An attacker would attempt to exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests which would be processed by a recycled `Request` object with the `requestedSessionSSL` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tomcat server.
*   **Web Application Configuration:** Exploitation is easier if the web application is configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID. However, it is not required to perform an attack.
*   **Precise Timing and Control:** Exploiting the vulnerability reliably is difficult, requiring precise control over the timing of requests in order to force the usage of a recycled `Request` object, making this attack impractical.
*   **Authentication:** For some attack scenarios (such as session hijacking), the attacker needs to know and potentially steal a valid session ID for a particular user.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   **Specific Versions Affected:**  The vulnerability affects Apache Tomcat versions 6.x before 6.0.45, 7.x before 7.0.66, 8.x before 8.0.31, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M2.
*   **Mitigation:**  Upgrading to the patched version of Tomcat is the primary mitigation.
*   **Upstream Fix:** Upstream fixes involved changes to `CoyoteAdapter.java` and `Request.java` to correctly recycle the `requestedSessionSSL` field.

This vulnerability is rated as moderate to important due to the potential for session hijacking even if it is difficult to achieve.

In summary, the issue is a session fixation vulnerability caused by a resource management oversight, which would require attackers to perform a complex attack.
