## Security Advisory 0013 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1180-security-advisory-13?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** September 4th 2015

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | September 4th, 2015 | Initial release |

**Arista Products vulnerability report for security updates released for QEMU on August 23rd, 2015.**

In August 2015 the Fedora project issued an update for QEMU that addresses a list of vulnerabilities

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator used natively in Fedora based systems. All shipping releases of Arista EOS have a feature to host guest virtual machines. This feature uses the QEMU process in the Linux kernel which makes EOS vulnerable if all of the following conditions are present:

* A virtual machine is configured and is running on EOS
* Untrusted users are allowed access to the virtual machine hosted on EOS
* Untrusted users that don’t have access to the network devices but have access to the virtual machine hosted by EOS

The list of virtual machines hosted by EOS can be viewed by running the command ‘show virtual-machines’

This advisory documents the vulnerability status of Arista 7000 Products and Arista EOS in response to the vulnerabilities listed below:

CVE-2015-5166 (qemu: BlockBackend object use after free issue)

| Vulnerability Status: | Not Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | Vulnerability is specific to the Xen hypervisor which does not ship in EOS |

CVE-2015-5745 (qemu: buffer overflow in virtio-serial)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | A user logged on to the guest OS can cause QEMU to crash |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 131404 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next release of the currently supported EOS releases - 4.15, 4.14, 4.13 and 4.12 |

CVE-2015-3209 (qemu: pcnet: multi-tmd buffer)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details | Heap based overflow in QEMU allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 131402 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next release of the currently supported EOS releases - 4.15, 4.14, 4.13 and 4.12 |

CVE-2015-5165 (qemu: rtl8139 uninitialized heap)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details | The user on the guest virtual machine could read uninitialized qemu memory on the switch and run arbitrary code |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 131406 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next release of the currently supported EOS releases - 4.15, 4.14, 4.13 and 4.12 |

CVE-2015-5154 (qemu: ide: atapi: heap overflow during I/O buffer memory access)

| Vulnerability Status: | Not Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | EOS only supports using an ISO image as a disk image. This vulnerability is exploited only when the container has a CD-ROM drive enabled. |

CVE-2015-3214 (qemu/kvm: i8254: out-of-bounds memory access in pit\_ioport\_read function)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | QEMU before 2.3.1 does not distinguish between read lengths and write lengths, which might allow users on the guest VM to execute arbitrary code on the switch by triggering use of an invalid index. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 131493 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next release of the currently supported EOS releases - 4.15, 4.14, 4.13 and 4.12 |

Subject: CVE request: Qemu: buffer overflow in virtio-serial

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the virtio-serial vmchannel support is vulnerable to
a buffer overflow issue. It could occur while exchanging virtio control
messages between guest & the host.

A malicious guest could use this flaw to corrupt few bytes of Qemu memory
area, potentially crashing the Qemu process.

Upstream fix:
