- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption issues existed in the processing of Unicode characters within the Data Detectors Engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to mishandling of Unicode character sequences.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Processing a specific sequence of Unicode characters can lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing or displaying maliciously crafted content containing the vulnerable unicode sequence.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce the target application to process the malicious unicode sequence, which can be done via various means (e.g. crafted document, web page, etc.)
