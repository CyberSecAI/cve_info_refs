Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how MATCHA SNS configures the database during the installation process. This flaw allows for code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The software is vulnerable to code injection, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker who can execute the installer can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server where MATCHA SNS is installed.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of the system, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the network, specifically when the attacker has access to the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the installer. This suggests the attacker needs some level of access to the server environment, although not necessarily authenticated access to the application itself
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability once the installer can be accessed and executed

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in MATCHA SNS versions 1.3.6 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Shoji Baba to IPA.
- The vendor, ICZ Corporation, released version 1.3.7 to address the vulnerability, which included a fix for the code injection issue.
