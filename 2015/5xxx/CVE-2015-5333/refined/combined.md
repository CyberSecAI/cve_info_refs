| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=950708#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-16 08:25:16 UTC  ``` From <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/87>  [...] Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334) [...]  In order to achieve remote code execution against the vulnerabilities that we recently discovered in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2015-7687), a memory leak is needed. Because we could not find one in OpenSMTPD itself, we started to review the malloc()s and free()s of its libraries, and eventually found a memory leak in LibreSSL's OBJ_obj2txt() function; we then realized that this function also contains a buffer overflow (an off-by-one, usually stack-based).  The vulnerable function OBJ_obj2txt() is reachable through X509_NAME_oneline() and d2i_X509(), which is called automatically to decode the X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake (both client-side, unless an anonymous mode is used, and server-side, if client authentication is requested).  These vulnerabilities affect all LibreSSL versions, including LibreSSL 2.0.0 (the first public release) and LibreSSL 2.3.0 (the latest release at the time of writing). OpenSSL is not affected.  [...]  ======================================================================== Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334) ========================================================================  As a result of CVE-2014-3508, OBJ_obj2txt() was modified to "Ensure that, at every state, |buf| is NUL-terminated." However, in LibreSSL, the error-handling code at the end of the function may write this null-terminator out-of-bounds:  489 int 490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name) 491 { ... 516         len = a->length; 517         p = a->data; 518 519         while (len > 0) { ... 522                 for (;;) { 523                         unsigned char c = *p++; 524                         len--; 525                         if ((len == 0) && (c & 0x80)) 526                                 goto err; ... 528                                 if (!BN_add_word(bl, c & 0x7f)) 529                                         goto err; ... 535                                 if (!bl && !(bl = BN_new())) 536                                         goto err; 537                                 if (!BN_set_word(bl, l)) 538                                         goto err; ... 542                                 if (!BN_lshift(bl, bl, 7)) 543                                         goto err; ... 546                 } ... 553                                         if (!BN_sub_word(bl, 80)) 554                                                 goto err; ... 561                         if (buf_len > 1) { 562                                 *buf++ = i + '0'; 563                                 *buf = '\0'; 564                                 buf_len--; 565                         } ... 569                 if (use_bn) { 570                         bndec = BN_bn2dec(bl); 571                         if (!bndec) 572                                 goto err; 573                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%s", bndec); 574                         if (i == -1) 575                                 goto err; 576                         if (i >= buf_len) { 577                                 buf += buf_len; 578                                 buf_len = 0; 579                         } else { 580                                 buf += i; 581                                 buf_len -= i; 582                         } ... 584                 } else { 585                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%lu", l); 586                         if (i == -1) 587                                 goto err; 588                         if (i >= buf_len) { 589                                 buf += buf_len; 590                                 buf_len = 0; 591                         } else { 592                                 buf += i; 593                                 buf_len -= i; 594                         } ... 597                 } 598         } 599 600 out: ... 603         return ret; 604 605 err: 606         ret = 0; 607         buf[0] = '\0'; 608         goto out; 609 }  First, in order to trigger this off-by-one buffer overflow, buf must be increased until it points to the first out-of-bounds character (i.e., until buf_len becomes zero):  - on the one hand, this is impossible with the code blocks at lines   561-564, 579-581, and 591-593;  - on the other hand, this is very easy with the code blocks at lines   576-578 and 588-590 (the destination buffer is usually quite small;   for example, it is only 80 bytes long in X509_NAME_oneline()).  Second, the code must branch to the err label:  - the "goto err"s at lines 574-575 and 586-587 are unreachable, because   snprintf() cannot possibly return -1 here;  - the "goto err" at lines 525-526 is:    . very easy to reach in LibreSSL <= 2.0.4;    . impossible to reach in LibreSSL >= 2.0.5, because of the "MSB must     be clear in the last octet" sanity check that was added to     c2i_ASN1_OBJECT():  286         /* 287          * Sanity check OID encoding: 288          * - need at least one content octet 289          * - MSB must be clear in the last octet 290          * - can't have leading 0x80 in subidentifiers, see: X.690 8.19.2 291          */ 292         if (len <= 0 || len > INT_MAX || pp == NULL || (p = *pp) == NULL || 293             p[len - 1] & 0x80) { 294                 ASN1err(ASN1_F_C2I_ASN1_OBJECT, ASN1_R_INVALID_OBJECT_ENCODING); 295                 return (NULL); 296         }  - the remaining "goto err"s are triggered by error conditions in various   BIGNUM functions:    . either because of a very large BIGNUM (approximately 64 megabytes,     which is impossible in the context of an SSL handshake, where X.509     certificates are limited to 100 kilobytes);    . or because of an out-of-memory condition (which can be reached     through the memory leak described above).  This off-by-one buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. However, when triggered through X509_NAME_oneline() (and therefore d2i_X509()), this buffer overflow is stack-based and probably not exploitable on OpenBSD x86, where it appears to always smash the stack canary.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=950707#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-16 08:23:35 UTC  ``` From <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/87>  [...] Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333) [...] In order to achieve remote code execution against the vulnerabilities that we recently discovered in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2015-7687), a memory leak is needed. Because we could not find one in OpenSMTPD itself, we started to review the malloc()s and free()s of its libraries, and eventually found a memory leak in LibreSSL's OBJ_obj2txt() function; we then realized that this function also contains a buffer overflow (an off-by-one, usually stack-based).  The vulnerable function OBJ_obj2txt() is reachable through X509_NAME_oneline() and d2i_X509(), which is called automatically to decode the X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake (both client-side, unless an anonymous mode is used, and server-side, if client authentication is requested).  These vulnerabilities affect all LibreSSL versions, including LibreSSL 2.0.0 (the first public release) and LibreSSL 2.3.0 (the latest release at the time of writing). OpenSSL is not affected.   ======================================================================== Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333) ========================================================================  OBJ_obj2txt() converts an ASN.1 object identifier (the ASN1_OBJECT a) into a null-terminated string of numerical subidentifiers separated by dots (at most buf_len bytes are written to buf).  Large subidentifiers are temporarily stored in a BIGNUM (bl) and converted by BN_bn2dec() into a printable string of decimal characters (bndec). Many such bndec strings can be malloc()ated and memory-leaked in a loop, because only the last one will be free()d, after the end of the loop:  489 int 490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name) 491 { ... 494         char *bndec = NULL; ... 516         len = a->length; ... 519         while (len > 0) { ... 570                         bndec = BN_bn2dec(bl); 571                         if (!bndec) 572                                 goto err; 573                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%s", bndec); ... 598         } ... 601         free(bndec); ... 609 }  This memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) or trigger the buffer overflow described below.

=== Content from ftp.openbsd.org_475258ba_20250125_004816.html ===
We have released LibreSSL 2.3.1, which will be arriving in the
LibreSSL directory of your local OpenBSD mirror soon.
This release is the second snapshot based on the development OpenBSD 5.9
branch. It is still likely to change more compared to the 2.2.x and 2.1.x
branches. The ABI/API for the LibreSSL 2.3.x series will be declared stable
around March 2016. See http://www.libressl.org/releases.html for more details.
LibreSSL 2.3.1 has the following notable changes:
\* ASN.1 cleanups and RFC5280 compliance fixes.
\* Time representations switched from 'unsigned long' to 'time\_t'. LibreSSL
now checks if the host OS supports 64-bit time\_t.
\* Fixed a leak in SSL\_new in the error path.
\* Support always extracting the peer cipher and version with libtls.
\* Added ability to check certificate validity times with libtls,
tls\_peer\_cert\_notbefore and tls\_peer\_cert\_notafter.
\* Changed tls\_connect\_servername to use the first address that resolves with
getaddrinfo().
\* Remove broken conditional EVP\_CHECK\_DES\_KEY code (non-functional since
initial commit in 2004).
\* Fixed a memory leak and out-of-bounds access in OBJ\_obj2txt, reported
by Qualys Security.
\* Fixed an up-to 7 byte overflow in RC4 when len is not a multiple of
sizeof(RC4\_CHUNK), reported by Pascal Cuoq .
\* Reject too small bits value in BN\_generate\_prime\_ex(), so that it does
not risk becoming negative in probable\_prime\_dh\_safe(), reported by
Franck Denis.
\* Enable nc(1) builds on more platforms.
The LibreSSL project continues improvement of the codebase to reflect modern,
safe programming practices. We welcome feedback and improvements from the
broader community. Thanks to all of the contributors who helped make this
release possible.
