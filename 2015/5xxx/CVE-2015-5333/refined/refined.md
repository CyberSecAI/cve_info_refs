{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-5333",
  "description": "Memory leak in the OBJ_obj2txt function in LibreSSL before 2.3.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of ASN.1 object identifiers in X.509 certificates.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `OBJ_obj2txt` function in LibreSSL has a memory leak. Inside a loop, the function allocates memory for `bndec` using `BN_bn2dec()`, but only the last allocation is freed after the loop, causing a memory leak when processing multiple sub-identifiers in an ASN.1 object identifier.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) by sending a large number of ASN.1 object identifiers in X.509 certificates. This can lead to resource exhaustion on the affected system.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered via a network connection through the exchange of X.509 certificates during an SSL/TLS handshake (both client-side and server-side).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSL/TLS handshake with a server or client using a maliciously crafted X.509 certificate containing a large number of ASN.1 object identifiers."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "LibreSSL before 2.3.1"
  ],
  "patch_details": "The vulnerability is fixed in LibreSSL 2.3.1 by ensuring that memory allocated during processing of ASN.1 object identifiers is properly freed.",
