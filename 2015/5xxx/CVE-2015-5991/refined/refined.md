Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The `form2WlanSetup.cgi` page does not properly authenticate that administrative actions are being performed on purpose. This lack of proper authentication allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The vulnerability lies in the absence of sufficient checks to verify the legitimacy of administrative requests made to `form2WlanSetup.cgi`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can lure a user into clicking a malicious link while they are behind the router, leading to unintended administrative actions. This could include changes to the device's network settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves luring a user to click a malicious link. This link would trigger an administrative action on the router through the vulnerable `form2WlanSetup.cgi` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a user who is already behind the vulnerable router into clicking a malicious link. This indicates the attacker does not need direct access to the router, but must rely on social engineering to leverage the user's active session with the device.
