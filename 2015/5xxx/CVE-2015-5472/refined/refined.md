Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `download.php` script within the IBS Mappro plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `file` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation in the `download.php` script. The script uses the `$_GET['file']` parameter directly in file system operations without checking if it is within intended directories, thus allowing access to any files readable by the webserver process.
- **Path Traversal:** An attacker can use path traversal techniques (e.g., using `../`) to navigate to directories outside the intended plugin directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, system files like `/etc/passwd`, or other application source code. This information could lead to further attacks or compromise of the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the `download.php` script with a modified `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target web server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable path:**  The attacker needs to know the location of the `download.php` script within the plugin's directory, which is typically predictable in WordPress installations.
