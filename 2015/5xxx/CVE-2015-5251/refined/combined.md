| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c0)  Summer Long    2015-09-16 03:23:51 UTC  ``` Vulnerability in Glance. By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a 'x-image-meta-status' header, a tenant can manipulate the status of their images. A malicious tenant may exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas and in some cases replace image contents. Setups using the Glance v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Setups which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c1)  Summer Long    2015-09-18 01:14:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1074617](attachment.cgi?id=1074617&action=diff "Upstream patch-Kilo") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1074617&action=edit "Upstream patch-Kilo") Upstream patch-Kilo   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c2)  Summer Long    2015-09-18 01:14:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1074618](attachment.cgi?id=1074618&action=diff "Upstream patch-Juno") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1074618&action=edit "Upstream patch-Juno") Upstream patch-Juno   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c3)  Summer Long    2015-09-18 01:14:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1074619](attachment.cgi?id=1074619&action=diff "Upstream patch-Liberty") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1074619&action=edit "Upstream patch-Liberty") Upstream patch-Liberty   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c5)  Summer Long    2015-10-12 06:44:38 UTC  ```  Created openstack-glance tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1270680](show_bug.cgi?id=1270680 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-5251 openstack-glance: openstack-glance allows illegal modification of image status [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1270681](show_bug.cgi?id=1270681)]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1263511#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-15 12:32:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 5 for RHEL 6   OpenStack 5 for RHEL 7   OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7   OpenStack 7 For RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:1897 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1897.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-30 09:10:08 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in openstack-glance allowing malicous user to cause DoS was reported. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db_api enabled are affected.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1897)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service where a
tenant could manipulate the status of their images by submitting an
HTTP PUT request together with an 'x-image-meta-status' header. A
malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images,
bypass storage quotas, and in some cases replace image contents (where
they have owner access). Setups using the Image service's v1 API could
allow the illegal modification of image status. Additionally, setups
which also use the v2 API could allow a subsequent re-upload of image
contents. (CVE-2015-5251)

A race-condition flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service.
When images in the upload state were deleted using a token close to
expiration, untracked image data could accumulate in the back end.
Because untracked data does not count towards the storage quota, an
attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service through
resource exhaustion. (CVE-2015-5286)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-5251, and Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin of
Mirantis as the original reporters of CVE-2015-5286.

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, running Image service services will be restarted
automatically.

# OSSA-2015-019: Glance image status manipulation

# OSSA-2015-019: Glance image status manipulation[Â¶](#ossa-2015-019-glance-image-status-manipulation "Link to this heading")

Date:

September 22, 2015

CVE:

CVE-2015-5251

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Glance: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Glance. By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a âx-image-meta-statusâ header, a tenant can manipulate the status of their images. A malicious tenant may exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas and in some cases replace image contents. Setups using the Glance v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Setups which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents.

# [OSSA 2015-019] Image status can be changed by passing header 'x-image-meta-status' with PUT operation using v1 (CVE-2015-5251)

### Bug Description

Using Glance v1, one is able to change the status of an image to any one of the valid statuses by passing the header 'x-image-meta-status' with PUT on /images/<image id>. This bug provides a way for an image to transition states that are otherwise not possible in an image's lifecycle.

See <http://paste.openstack.org/show/pNL7kvIZUz7cWJQwX64d/> for a reproduction of this behavior on devstack.

As shown in the above paste, though one is able to change the status of an active image to queued, uploading data after re-setting the status to queued fails with a 400[1]. Though the purpose of [1] appears to be slightly different, it's fortunately saving us from badly breaking the immutability guarantees of glance images.

[1] <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/api/v1/images.py#L760-L765>

NOTE: Marking this as a security vulnerability for now as users would be able to activate the deactivated images on their own. This probably affects deployments only where v1 is exposed publicly. However, it's probably worth discussing this from a security perspective as well.

This is a valid bug in Glance. It's not very insecure but, if combined with certain features of v2 like deactivation of an image (that's only allowed by admin by default), this change may result into bad image state and potentially give attackers the access to unauthorized image data.

Also, this has a per-condition that the v1 endpoint for Glance needs to be exposed. Not all deployments allow this and is not a standard, recommended practice.

Possible solution is to validate the headers and give back a 400 if 'x-image-meta-status' key is found in the update call.

I'm happy to see that the immutability does not seem to be threatened currently. That gives us way more room to breath.

Even still being security issue I think this should be made public as this bug was widely discussed in weekly glance team meeting: <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/glance/2015/glance.2015-08-06-14.03.log.txt> 14:29 +

Yes the image might get rendered unusable via mechanism that was never supposed to be there is quite a bit less worrying than what was discussed on the meeting.

After having a chat with Hemanth, I'd like to pull back that previous statement about opening this bug. There is attack vector that has not been discussed openly. If admin has deactivated image due to malicious content/behavior, that image can be put back to queued and activated without approval.

This would allow booting new VMs from that potentially malicious image. So lets keep this closed for now.

I've found a couple of ways to change the image bytes (break the immutability guarantee).

1. Set the image back to queued and upload using v2

(<http://paste.openstack.org/show/412169>)

2. Use --location to replace the image location

(<http://paste.openstack.org/show/412172>)

When set\_image\_location is allowed by policy it's always possible for a user to upload new

bytes to the location behind glance's back. But previously that would result in a checksum error

when the user went to download the replaced bytes. The change in behaviour here is that the

checksum, size, etc of the image are changed so the download will not raise any error.

I tried copy-from to change the image bytes, and I also tried setting the image status from the nova client.

Both failed to do anything bad.

Oh well! I didn't try uploading with v2. Good find, Stuart!

Also, mucking with my test environment further, I discovered that one can change created\_at as well using the header 'x-image-meta-created\_at'. I haven't tried doing the same with updated\_at, deleted\_at and deleted fields but I don't see anything that stops them from getting modified either. I will try it here in a bit.

A lot of it has to do with the whitelisting of headers here, <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/common/utils.py#L59-L70>.

It appears that this was done very explicitly. Does anyone know what could be the reason for it?

From memory, those whitelisted headers are headers that are legal to return in a response to a user.

I think the idea was to prevent the leaking of a header that we don't want to return. So, when we return

a v1 response to a user the set of 'x-image-meta-...' headers that is possible for the user to see is defined

by this whitelist. (There had been a bug where we were returning something the user shouldn't see as a

header).

Is this something you guys have a chance to start work on?

If not, I can try to find time to take a look.

Thanks for the note on whitelisted headers. What you said makes sense but it seems the whitelisting is used in a different context here. It's used for accepting headers in the request as opposed to returning headers in the response.

Looking again at the whitelisting of headers. It looks like previously any 'x-image-meta-blah' header that the user provided would be passed from the api to the registry. The whitelist meant that any unexpected 'x-image-meta-xxx' headers would be rejected with 400. (But the whitelist doesn't attempt to handle different behaviour for any of the defined headers.)

In v2 an attempt to write to a 'read only' property such as status or updated\_at, or a reserved property such as 'owner' will raise a 403 (Forbidden).

In v1, if an attempt to write to 'owner' is made the 'x-image-meta-owner' header will effectively just be dropped and 200 will be returned. If the image is active and an attempt is made to change size, checksum a 403 will be returned.

We'll need to decide the behaviour for attempts to update 'status', 'updated\_at' etc, ie whether to silently drop them or return 403.

Here's the current behaviour for the various headers which can be supplied:

It probably makes sense to return 403 for 'id', since the current behaviour won't update any other parameters when id is provided.

In the case of status we could consider just ignoring it, ie matching the behaviour of 'owner', ie it is not really something 'settable' in v1, so ignore it.

I think the order of validation should be:

1) Check whether the header being passed is valid/allowed.

2) Check if the value provided is valid.

The reason I believe the above is correct s that doing it the other way around we'd give the attacker hints of what status are valid. This might not be such a big issue since image's status are public anyway but still, I believe that would be the right workflow.

There's no point on letting the user guess the right status to then let the user know that status can't be updated.

Hope the above makes sense.

As mentioned in my previous comment, I think it'd be better to raise 403 in every case as a general thing. I believe we should do that in v2, at least. Nonetheless, I think the current patch is good and it preserves the current behavior on v1, which is in maintenance mode.

+1 for the patch, tested locally. Thanks, Stuart.

Stuart, the patch looks good to me, too. I don't see a way to disallow 'setting' to the same status without causing major problems ... that was a good catch to notice nova setting status as part of snapshotting on xenserver.

Please review this impact description for correctness. I will use it to request a CVE for this issue once I've verified that it is accurate.

Title: Glance v1 API image status manipulation

Reporter: Hemanth Makkapati (Rackspace)

Products: Glance

Affects: all 2013.2 and 2014.1 versions, 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3,

          and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1

Description:

Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Glance. By submitting

a HTTP PUT request with a 'x-image-meta-status' header, a malicious tenant can

manipulate the status of public images without requiring administrative

privileges. This may allow an attacker to reactivate a malicious images that

was disabled by an administrator, potentially impacting other tenants. Only setups

using the Glance v1 API are affected by this flaw.

Hi Grant,

Thanks for that. As Stuart pointed out on comment #6 it would be also possible to upload replacement data utilizing v2 API after the initial status change over v1 API. This would break the immutability promise we have.

Rest, please correct me, but this issue was only affecting images owned by tenant (and admins), right? One couldn't alter images they did not own.

@Grant

Some tweaks:

"By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a 'x-image-meta-status' header, a malicious tenant can

manipulate the status of public images without requiring administrative

privileges."

This isn't specific to public images. Also, the admin privilege is a bit of a red herring I think. Basically, standard users can only modify the state of images that they own (as Erno says above).

Maybe something like:

"By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a 'x-image-meta-status' header, a tenant can

manipulate the status of their images. In some cases this then allows replacing the image contents by reuploading them -- which should not be allowed as 'active' images are considered immutable."

"Only setups using the Glance v1 API are affected by this flaw."

"Only setups using the Glance v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Only setups which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents."

Given a tenant can't actually alter images which aren't under their control, what are the exploit scenarios for this vulnerability? Simply reenabling images of theirs which the admin has disabled, or substituting a malicious replacement image after conclusion of an audit validating the image being surreptitiously replaced?

Lets say, cloud has workflow for 3rd party images where the image gets uploaded by 3rd party, validated and marked public by cloud admin. With this bug the 3rd party can replace the image (and it's checksum) after it has been made public providing for example malicious payload breaking the immutability promise glance has. This would need V1 & V2 APIs.

The other possibility is that private/shared/public image gets flagged malicious and disabled for further analysis. Tenant can move it back from being disabled to active and allow booting from it again. Only V1 API is needed for such actions.

You can also work around the storage usage limit by toggling images between 'killed' and 'active'. ie toggle them to 'killed' so you won't be 1) billed for them 2) they wont count towards your storage useage; then toggle back to active before you want to boot them.

Toggling images back from the dead seems like an iffy exploit scenario, since I would expect service providers to delete these in an effort to reclaim space anyway. The surreptitious replacement however, if it's documented that image-to-UUID mapping is immutable, does at least seem like a failing in a security guarantee users might depend on.

I want to stress the point Hemanth made somewhere above about image activate/deactivate.

In Kilo, Glance added a security feature that allows an admin to "deactivate" an image while a deployer investigates it. (The image still exists, its record is still visible, but Glance will refuse to download the image data, and hence instances can't be booted from it.) An image owner with access to the v1 API can use this exploit to put the image back into active status, which pretty much negates the deactivation security feature.

If standard users can only modify the state of images that they own, whenever an admin deactivate an image, what would prevent the user to re-upload it instead of switching the status of the deactivated image back to active ?

Also if an admin deactivates the image and then the user reactivates it through this bug, can't the admin just delete the image (after making a copy for themselves) or, for that matter, disable the (now obviously abusive) tenant entirely?

Patch applies correctly and tests seems ok. I confirm this fixed the issue in stable/kilo.

Can we get another +2 from glance-coresec ?

To reiterate the boilerplate in the bug description, please avoid (even private) disclosure of the vulnerability and associated patches to other individuals not already approved for access to this information. Deploying the patches in production in a large service provider runs the risk that others within the same organization have access to the details of this fix in advance of the downstream pre-notification.

commit 34f9f037136061f7437761e86ea9f0864b297619

Author: Stuart McLaren <email address hidden>

Date: Tue Aug 11 10:37:09 2015 +0000

Prevent image status being directly modified via v1

Users shouldn't be able to change an image's status directly via the

    v1 API.

Some existing consumers of Glance set the x-image-meta-status header in

    requests to the Glance API, eg:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/plugins/xenserver/xenapi/etc/xapi.d/plugins/glance#L184>

We should try to prevent users setting 'status' via v1, but without breaking

    existing benign API calls such as these.

I've adopted the following approach (which has some prior art in 'protected properties').

If a PUT request is received which contains an x-image-meta-status header:

\* The user provided status is ignored if it matches the current image

      status (this prevents benign calls such as the nova one above from

      breaking). The usual code (eg 200) will be returned.

\* If the user provided status doesn't match the current image status (ie

      there is a real attempt to change the value) 403 will be returned. This

      will break any calls which currently intentionally change the status.
