{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenStack Image service (glance) allowed tenants to manipulate image status via a specific HTTP header in PUT requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient access control",
       "Bypass of intended image state transitions"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious tenant could reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas, and potentially replace image contents.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP PUT request to the Glance v1 API endpoint with a 'x-image-meta-status' header.",
      "Using the v2 API to re-upload image contents after manipulating the status with v1."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a tenant with the ability to modify image metadata. Exploitation also relies on the v1 API being exposed to the attacker."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Image service (glance). By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a 'x-image-meta-status' header, a tenant could manipulate the status of their images. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas and in some cases replace image contents. Setups using the Glance v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Setups which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents. Additionally, the attacker could modify 'created_at' using 'x-image-meta-created_at'. The vulnerability is present in Glance versions <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, and <=2015.1.1."
