Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5826:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Safari's handling of cross-origin stylesheets. Specifically, it allowed stylesheets with non-CSS MIME types to be loaded across origins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Origin Data Exfiltration:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a malicious website to load stylesheets with non-CSS MIME types from other origins. This bypass of the same-origin policy could be exploited to extract sensitive data.
- **MIME Type Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of MIME types when loading stylesheets from different origins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious website can exfiltrate data cross-origin by loading stylesheets with non-CSS MIME types. This could expose sensitive information to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user must visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker. The malicious site loads a cross-origin stylesheet using a non-CSS MIME type in order to exfiltrate data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website and have a user visit it. The attacker also needs to be able to control a resource (file) to be loaded with non-CSS MIME type.
