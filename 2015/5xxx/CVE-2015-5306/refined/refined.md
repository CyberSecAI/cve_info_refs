{
  "CVE-2015-5306": {
    "description": "It was discovered that enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd also enabled debug mode in the underlying Flask framework. If errors were encountered while Flask was in debug mode, a user experiencing an error might be able to access the debug console (effectively, a command shell).",
    "root_cause": "Enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd also enabled debug mode in the underlying Flask framework.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote code execution via Flask debug console"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker able to trigger an error and expose the Flask console could use the console to run arbitrary Python code on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Triggering an error that exposes the Flask console when debug mode is enabled."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger an error in the application that is running with Flask debug mode enabled, and they need network access to the exposed debug console."
