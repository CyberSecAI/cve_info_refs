## Synopsis

Important: openstack-ironic-discoverd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A2685)

## Topic

Updated openstack-ironic-discoverd packages that fix one security issue are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Bare Metal (ironic) is a tool used to provision bare metal
(as opposed to virtual) machines. It leverages common technologies such
as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports
pluggable drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.

It was discovered that enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd
also enabled debug mode in the underlying Flask framework. If errors were
encountered while Flask was in debug mode, a user experiencing an error
might be able to access the debug console (effectively, a command shell).
(CVE-2015-5306)

Please note that this package is a Technology Preview and should not be
used in production.

All openstack-ironic-discoverd users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

### Bug Description

A lot of people default to running their servers in debug mode. While handy for getting the full logs, in our case it will also allow access to Flask console, which may pose a security risk. We need a separate option for this.

Sorry, as Garth Mollett pointed out to me via E-mail, this is not simply an information disclosure but instead a backdoor. Probably the closest prior report I've seen is [bug 1425206](/bugs/1425206).

Though also, Ironic is not currently under OpenStack VMT oversight[\*], so take this as guidance for how I would have classified it were that not actually the case.

For the sake of documentation, another good reason not to run in debug mode is that it causes Flask to create a second process to monitor changes to the file system. The eventlet greenthreads for periodic clean up and firewall update tasks end up running in both processes, breaking the synchronisation in the firewall module. If the periodic firewall update runs in the parent process at the same time as an introspection callback API is handled in the main process, the two can interact, and cause unexpected errors, leading to inspection failure.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1929)

## Topic

Updated openstack-ironic-discoverd packages that fix one security issue are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Ironic provides bare metal provisioning for OpenStack nodes.

It was discovered that enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd
also enables debug mode in the underlying Flask framework. If errors are
encountered while Flask is in debug mode, a user experiencing an error may
be able to access the debug console (effectively, a command shell).
(CVE-2015-5306)

All openstack-ironic-discoverd users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct this issue.

## Solution

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

[stack@pvn0014 ~]$ openstack baremetal show 4f16afcf-5b57-4676-96b9-46d603552dab | grep properties | properties             | {u'memory_mb': u'512', u'cpu_arch': u'x86_64', u'local_gb': u'118', u'cpus': u'48', u'capabilities': u'boot_option:local'}  Where are you experiencing the behavior?  What environment?  Expected to see a long number 528089 or something. I think this will cause issues when assigning flavors that have larger memory then 512mb.
