For step-by-step instructions on installing and updating WordPress:

## [Summary](#summary)

From the [announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4/), WordPress 4.2.4 fixes three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site (CVE-2015-2213).

It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited.

In addition to the security fixes, WordPress 4.2.4 contains fixes for 4 bugs from [4.2.3](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3), including:

* FIX – WPDB: When checking the encoding of strings against the database, make sure we’re only relying on the return value of strings that were sent to the database. [#32279](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32279)
* FIX – Don’t blindly trust the output of glob() to be an array. [#33093](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33093)
* FIX – Shortcodes: Handle do\_shortcode(‘<[shortcode]’) edge cases. [#33116](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33116)
* FIX – Shortcodes: Protect newlines inside of CDATA. [#33106](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33106)

The correct parsing of that sentence is like:

  WordPress 4.2.4 fixes three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
  [a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site
  (CVE-2015-2213)]

not like:

  [WordPress 4.2.4 fixes three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and
  a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site]
  (CVE-2015-2213)

See below for the set of 6 CVE IDs that correspond to the currently
available information.

> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33555>
> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33556>

Use CVE-2015-2213 only for this SQL injection issue.

> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33536>

> <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33543>

# WordPress 4.2.4 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a**security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by [Marc-Alexandre Montpas](https://sucuri.net/) of Sucuri, [Helen Hou-Sandí](http://helenhousandi.com/) of the WordPress security team, [Netanel Rubin](http://www.checkpoint.com/) of Check Point, and [Ivan Grigorov](https://hackerone.com/reactors08). It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by [Johannes Schmitt](http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/) of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by [Mohamed A. Baset](https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh).

Our thanks to those who have practiced [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/) of security issues.

WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&stop_rev=33396).

[Download WordPress 4.2.4](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.

*Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available ([zip](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip)) and it contains these fixes. For more on 4.3, see [the RC 1 announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-release-candidate/).*
