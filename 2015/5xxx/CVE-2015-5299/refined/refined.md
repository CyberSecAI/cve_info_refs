Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-5299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A missing access control check in the `vfs_shadow_copy2` module within the Samba software. Specifically, the `shadow_copy2_get_shadow_copy_data` function does not verify if the user has `DIRECTORY_LIST` access rights before allowing them to browse snapshot directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of a proper access control check. This allows authenticated users to bypass the intended permission system.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Permissions:** Specifically, the module fails to enforce the required `DIRECTORY_LIST` access rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Snapshots:** An authenticated, remote attacker could view the current snapshot on a Samba share, even if they do not have the required `DIRECTORY_LIST` access rights.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This means that users might be able to view files in snapshots they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the SMB/CIFS protocol.
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs to authenticate to the Samba server before exploiting this issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be able to authenticate to the affected Samba share.
*  **No DIRECTORY_LIST Access:** The attacker should NOT have the DIRECTORY_LIST permission

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** All Samba versions from 3.2.0 to 4.3.1 (inclusive) were found to be vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability was addressed in Samba versions 4.1.22, 4.2.7, and 4.3.3.
*   **Module:** The vulnerability is in the `vfs_shadow_copy2` module.
*   **Upstream Acknowledgment:**  The Samba project acknowledges partha as the original reporter.
*   **Specific Action:** A remote authenticated user could use this flaw to view the current snapshot on a samba share by visiting a shadow copy directory.
