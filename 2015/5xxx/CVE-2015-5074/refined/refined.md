It is therefore possible to execute any PHP code on the remote system.\n\nImpact:\nPermitting the uploading of arbitrary files could result in highly damaging content such as malware, indecent images, viruses and/or pirated software being uploaded and stored, and later downloaded. In addition, the storage of such material could quite possibly have serious legal implications for the hosting organisation.\n\nIn this case, an attacker could exploit the functionality to upload server scripts which, when requested by a browser, would execute code on the server.\n\nExploit:\nExploit code not required.\n\nRemediation:\nThe vendor has released a patch however it is also possible to add new extensions such as PHT to the existing blacklist.\nVendor status:\n15/09/2014\tSubmitted initial contact via web form on X2Engine’s page\n30/09/2014\tSecond initial contact message sent via web form\n08/12/2014\tFinal chaser sent via their web form\n20/01/2015\tAutomated response from the X2 website received on 08/12/2014.
