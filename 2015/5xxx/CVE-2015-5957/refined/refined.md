Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5957:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the `DumpSysVar` function within the `var.c` file of the `remind` software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow caused by insufficient bounds checking when handling a system variable name. Specifically, the code attempts to copy the name of a system variable into a fixed-size buffer, and if the name is too long, a buffer overflow occurs, potentially overwriting other memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "unspecified" in the CVE description, but the provided CVSS vector indicates a high potential for severe consequences including:
  - Complete loss of confidentiality (C:C)
  - Complete loss of integrity (I:C)
  - Complete loss of availability (A:C)
This suggests an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code, alter data, or cause the software to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a "long name". This refers to a long system variable name. It is assumed that this name could be set via user-provided input, but the specifics are not explicit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a long variable name to the `DumpSysVar` function. The content suggests the attack can originate remotely over a network (AV:N) and requires no prior authentication (Au:N) and is of low complexity(AC:L)
- Further detail is not available in the provided content, but it is likely that the attacker would either need to control the environment or be able to supply specifically crafted input to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `remind` versions 3.1.14 and earlier.
- The fix involves adding a check to verify that the length of the variable name doesn't exceed `VAR_NAME_LEN` before copying it to a buffer.
- Patched versions include `remind-3.1.15` and later.
- The issue is tracked by SUSE bugzilla as #940924.

In summary, CVE-2015-5957 is a buffer overflow in `remind` which can be triggered by a long variable name leading to potentially complete system compromise. The fix is a simple bounds check.
