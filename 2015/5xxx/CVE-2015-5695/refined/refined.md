Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the OpenStack Designate component's failure to properly enforce quotas for record sets, specifically the number of record sets per domain and the number of records per record set. Due to this, it is possible to create a record set exceeding the maximum allowed DNS packet size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Quota Enforcement:** The core issue is the lack of proper enforcement of record set quotas, which allows users to bypass intended limits.
- **Infinite Loop:** When a DNS zone file transfer is initiated (e.g., by a secondary DNS server), the Designate mDNS service enters an infinite loop when processing a record set that exceeds the maximum DNS packet size. This loop occurs because the service attempts to render the oversized record set, fails due to its size, and restarts the rendering process without advancing to the next record set.
- **Lack of Timeout:** The mDNS service lacks a timeout mechanism, so it continues to attempt to process the oversized record set indefinitely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The infinite loop in the mDNS service consumes excessive CPU resources, effectively rendering the service unresponsive. This prevents the DNS server from receiving updates, and may impact the resolution of DNS records for the affected domains.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user who has the ability to create DNS record sets.
- **Oversized Record Set:** The attacker must create a single record set that exceeds the configured maximum DNS packet size. This can be done by creating a large number of records under a single record set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access and interact with the Designate API.
- **API Access:** The attacker must be able to make API calls to create record sets within Designate.
- **Knowledge of DNS limitations:** The attacker needs to be aware of DNS limitations, particularly DNS packet size limits, to craft a malicious record set effectively.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is related to, but distinct from CVE-2015-5694, which addresses the lack of enforcement of DNS protocol limits concerning record set sizes. While both issues are related to record set size management, CVE-2015-5695 specifically focuses on the vulnerability arising from the missing quota enforcement combined with the infinite loop in mDNS.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability and also implemented proper quota enforcement to prevent users from creating such large record sets.
- The vulnerability affects OpenStack Designate versions 2015.1.0 through 1.0.0.0b1.
