CVE: TBA
Date: July 28, 2015
Title: Designate mDNS DoS through incorrect handling of large RecordSets
Reporter: Florian Weimer (Red Hat)
Products: Designate
Versions: 2015.1.0 through 1.0.0.0b1

Description:
Florian Weimer from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Designate.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c0)  Florian Weimer    2015-07-21 14:31:27 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the Designate component in OpenStack would enter an infinite loop when processing an internal zone file transfer if a managed DNS zone included a resource record set whose size exceeded the limitations of the DNS protocol, leading to a denial of service.  Only authenticated users with access to the Designate component can add such resource record sets.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:33:40 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/226>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:34:30 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/designate/+bug/1471161](https://bugs.launchpad.net/designate/%2Bbug/1471161)  External References:  <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack/2015-July/013548.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1245241#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-07-29 10:37:34 UTC  ```  Created openstack-designate tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1247952](show_bug.cgi?id=1247952)]   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Designate does not enforce the DNS protocol limit concerning record set sizes when adding records for a domain name. The protocol limit is slightly less than 2\*\*16 bytes because of some data that must accompany any record set, as part of the zone file transfer.

As a result, the rendering loop in desginate-mdns can does not make progress because the problematic record set at rrsets[i] will never fit (per designate/mdns/handler.py:RequestHandler.\_handle\_axfr):

# Render the results, yielding a packet after each TooBig exception.

        i, renderer = 0, None

        while i < len(rrsets):

            # No renderer? Build one

            if renderer is None:

                renderer = dns.renderer.Renderer(

                    response.id, response.flags, max\_message\_size)

…

            try:

                renderer.add\_rrset(dns.renderer.ANSWER, rrsets[i])

                i += 1

            except dns.exception.TooBig:

                renderer.write\_header()

                if request.had\_tsig:

…

                yield renderer

                renderer = None

When this happens, designate-mdns will keep sending SOA records over and over again:

sendto(37, "\0\35<{\204\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\7example\3org\0\0\374\0\1", 31, 0, NULL, 0) = 31

sendto(37, "\0\35<{\204\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\7example\3org\0\0\374\0\1", 31, 0, NULL, 0) = 31

sendto(37, "\0\35<{\204\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\7example\3org\0\0\374\0\1", 31, 0, NULL, 0) = 31

Here is how I triggered this. I created a domain example.org:

+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------+

| id | name | serial |

+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------+

| ded903fc-60ef-4b5e-a37c-f3181baf9516 | example.org. | 1435315435 |

+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------+

Then I added several hundred NS records for the same subdomain, using this shell command:

for x in {1..304} ; do

  designate record-create --name 'sub.example.org.' --type NS --data \

$x'.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.'$x. \

  ded903fc-60ef-4b5e-a37c-f3181baf9516

done

In the tested configuration, PowerDNS will attempt a zone file transfer, and trigger the bug. Because it keeps receiving data, it does not seem it will ever run into a timeout (and if it does, it will try again).

RedHat doesn't seem to have an equivalent package search site, but I'm assuming since they filed this issue, it affects RedHat too.

I think there is 2 parts to this bug:

1: Quotas were being bypassed as part of the v1 API.

2. If there was enough RRs in a RRSet MiniDNS went into a loop.

3. MiniDNS does not have a timeout.

1 is not really relevant - 2 should not happen in anycase.

The patch fixes 2, but not 3 - should we be include that in the fix?

I've gone and implemented the RRSet related quota enforcement for Master and Kilo, this was not previously implemented. I've included them in this bug, as publishing them now might indicate there's an issue with RRset sizes, but I don't consider them directly part of this DoS vulnerability.

i.e. An operator could choose to have infinite quotas (a valid use case), and we should support that.

I have not tested the Quotas patch yet, but it should be DNS Server agnostic.
