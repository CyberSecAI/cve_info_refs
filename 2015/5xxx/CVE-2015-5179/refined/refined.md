Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in FreeIPA, specifically for user data. Non-printable characters (like `\10`, `\177`, `\40` etc.) are not being checked or filtered, allowing them to be inserted into user attributes such as first name, last name and vault descriptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** FreeIPA does not properly validate or sanitize input strings, particularly those related to user attributes and vault descriptions.
- **Non-Printable Character Handling:** The system fails to correctly handle non-printable characters, allowing them to be stored and displayed improperly. This can lead to unexpected output and potentially trick the administrator

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Display Corruption:** Non-printable characters in user data can cause the display of user information to be corrupted or misrepresented. For example, a crafted name field could make the displayed output look malformed.
- **Potential for Misleading Information:** By manipulating user data with non-printable characters, an attacker could potentially mislead administrators about the actual values stored in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The provided examples demonstrate that the vulnerability can be exploited using the `ipa` command-line tool. By crafting malicious input with non-printable characters (like \10, \40, etc) and supplying it to the `ipa vault-mod` or `ipa user-add` commands, an attacker can introduce such characters into the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permissions required to modify user attributes or vault descriptions in FreeIPA. This suggests that an attacker with administrative or delegated administration privileges could exploit this vulnerability.
