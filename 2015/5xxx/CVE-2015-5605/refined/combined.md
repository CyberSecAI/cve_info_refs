Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/07/stable-channel-update_21.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, July 21, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 44 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 44.0.2403.89 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/43.0.2357.134..44.0.2403.89?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 44.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [43 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=Release%3D0-M44+Status%3AFixed%2CVerified&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified+Reporter&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2015-1271, CVE-2015-1270, CVE-2015-1272, CVE-2015-1273,
CVE-2015-1274, CVE-2015-1276, CVE-2015-1277, CVE-2015-1278, CVE-2015-1279,
CVE-2015-1281, CVE-2015-1282, CVE-2015-1283, CVE-2015-1284, CVE-2015-1285,
CVE-2015-1286, CVE-2015-1287, CVE-2015-1288, CVE-2015-1289, CVE-2015-5605)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 44.0.2403.89, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

# V8 JavaScript Engine

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.

V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262.

V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.

V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

V8 Project page: <https://code.google.com/p/v8/>

# Getting the Code

Checkout [depot tools](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools), and run

```
    fetch v8

```

This will checkout V8 into the directory `v8` and fetch all of its dependencies. To stay up to date, run

```
    git pull origin
    gclient sync

```

For fetching all branches, add the following into your remote configuration in `.git/config`:

```
    fetch = +refs/branch-heads/*:refs/remotes/branch-heads/*
    fetch = +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*

```
