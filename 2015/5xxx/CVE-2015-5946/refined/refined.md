Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete blacklist used to prevent the upload of executable files in SuiteCRM. This blacklist approach is flawed, allowing attackers to bypass the intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The primary weakness is the use of a blacklist instead of a whitelist to filter file uploads. The blacklist was: `'php', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5', 'pl', 'cgi', 'py', 'asp', 'cfm', 'js', 'vbs', 'html', 'htm'`.
*   **Bypassable File Extension Check:** Attackers can upload files with executable code by using file extensions not present in the blacklist (e.g., ".phtml").
*   **Web-Accessible Temporary Directory:** The file upload process involves storing files in a web-accessible temporary directory during verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server under the context of the web server user. This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a file using the "Upload Company Logo" functionality or similar feature.
*   **Blacklist Bypass:** The attacker bypasses the blacklist by using a file extension not explicitly blocked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the SuiteCRM application to access the file upload functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Blacklist:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the blacklist and a suitable file extension to bypass it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also mentions similar vulnerabilities in SugarCRM and VTiger CRM. However, these are considered different issues and not related to CVE-2015-5946.
*   CVE-2015-5947 is related to another issue where access to unverified files is not restricted, and CVE-2015-5948 is related to a race condition due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2015-5947.
*   The email from the CVE assignment team also indicates that the use of blacklisting itself, without a specific bypass, is not considered a CVE issue. The same applies to the use of web-accessible temporary directories.

The provided content gives a clear picture of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5946 which is related to a blacklist bypass leading to RCE.
