{
  "CVE-2015-5358": {
    "Root cause": "The TCP socket enters the LAST_ACK state when closing a connection, waiting for acknowledgement that FIN was delivered or failure of all packet retransmissions. In this state, the socket may hold a significant amount of memory (mbufs). A \"persist\" timer responsible for cleaning up this memory was deactivated, causing the memory to be held indefinitely.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to memory held in LAST_ACK state",
      "Deactivated \"persist\" timer prevents memory cleanup"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote denial of service due to memory exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attacker can make the attacked system's sockets enter the LAST_ACK state, causing memory exhaustion.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections that can be manipulated to enter the LAST_ACK state."
  }
