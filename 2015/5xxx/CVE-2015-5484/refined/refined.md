Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when embedding Plotly graphs. The WordPress plugin `wp-plotly` allowed users to insert arbitrary JavaScript code into their posts or pages, which would then be executed by other users' browsers. This vulnerability stemmed from the plugin's handling of Plotly graph URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code could be embedded into a post/page through the Plotly graph URL and persist, affecting all users who viewed the content.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to sanitize or properly escape user-provided input, allowing script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users viewing the affected content.
*   **Account Hijacking:** With JavaScript execution, attackers could potentially steal cookies and session data, leading to account compromise.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate malware downloads, which could harm site users and visitors.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance or content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plotly URL:** The primary attack vector involved crafting a malicious Plotly URL containing JavaScript code.
*   **WordPress Post/Page Embedding:** Attackers would embed this crafted URL into a WordPress post or page using the plugin's functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needed a user account with the ability to create and edit posts/pages but *without* the `unfiltered_html` capability. This includes roles such as Editor, Author, or Contributor (depending on the site setup) on WordPress.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker had to be aware of the vulnerability in the `wp-plotly` plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in version 1.0.2 of the `wp-plotly` plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.3.
*   The `unfiltered_html` capability in WordPress allows users to embed HTML and JavaScript. This vulnerability specifically targeted users *without* this capability, highlighting a privilege escalation.
*   On single-site WordPress installations, only administrators possess the `unfiltered_html` capability, whereas on multisite installations, only Super Admins have it. Therefore, on a multisite environment, malicious admins or editors could leverage this vulnerability against other site users.

In summary, CVE-2015-5484 describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the wp-plotly WordPress plugin that allowed lower privileged users to inject malicious JavaScript by crafting a specific URL, which would then be executed when other users visited the page.
