# Stored XSS in Plotly allows less privileged users to insert arbitrary JavaScript into posts (WordPress plugin)

---

*From*: dxw Security <security () dxw com>

*Date*: Mon, 13 Jul 2015 15:14:55 +0000

---

```
Details
================
Software: Plotly
Version: 1.0.2
Homepage: <http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plotly/>
Advisory report:
<https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-in-plotly-allows-less-privileged-users-to-insert-arbitrary-javascript-into-posts/>
CVE: CVE-2015-5484
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
Stored XSS in Plotly allows less privileged users to insert arbitrary JavaScript into posts

Vulnerability
================
This plugin allows users who do not have the unfiltered_html capability to insert JavaScript into posts/pages which
gets executed by the browsers of other users.
On single sites, only Administrators have the unfiltered_html capability, and on multisite, only Super Admins have this
capability. This means that e.g. malicious Admins on a multisite, or malicious Editors would be able to perform XSS
attacks against other site users and visitors.

Proof of concept
================

Create a new post as a user (without the unfiltered_html capability)
Switch to text mode
Place this link on a line by itself: [https://plot.ly/~a/’onerror=’alert](https://plot.ly/~a/%E2%80%99onerror%3D%E2%80%99alert)(1)’>
View the post

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.0.3 or later.
N.B. If all accounts are trusted, or all accounts have the unfiltered_html capability, then there is no issue.

Disclosure policy
================
dxw believes in responsible disclosure. Your attention is drawn to our disclosure policy:
<https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/>

Please contact us on security () dxw com to acknowledge this report if you received it via a third party (for example,
plugins () wordpress org) as they generally cannot communicate with us on your behalf.

This vulnerability will be published if we do not receive a response to this report with 14 days.

Timeline
================

2015-06-04: Discovered
2015-07-09: Reported to vendor via the contact form on the Plotly Enterprise site
2015-07-09: Requested CVE
2015-07-10: Vendor responded and confirmed fixed in 1.0.3
2015-07-13: Published

Discovered by dxw:

[↑ Back to top](#wp--skip-link--target)

WordPress uses a concept of [Roles](#roles), designed to give the [site](/support/article/glossary/#site) owner the ability to control what users can and cannot do within the site. A site owner can manage the user access to such tasks as [writing and editing posts](/support/article/writing-posts/), [creating Pages](/support/article/pages/), [creating categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel), [moderating comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation), [managing plugins](/support/article/managing-plugins/), [managing themes](/support/article/using-themes/), and [managing other users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen), by assigning a specific role to each of the users.

WordPress has six pre-defined roles: [Super Admin](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin), [Administrator](#administrator), [Editor](#editor), [Author](#author), [Contributor](#contributor) and [Subscriber](#subscriber). Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called [Capabilities](/support/article/glossary/#capabilities). There are many capabilities including “[publish\_posts](#publish_posts)“, “[moderate\_comments](#moderate_comments)“, and “[edit\_users](#edit_users)“. [A default set](#capability-vs-role-table) of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the [add\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap) and [remove\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_cap) functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the [add\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_role) and [remove\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_role) functions.

The [Super Admin](#super-admin) role allows a user to perform all possible capabilities. Each of the other roles has a decreasing number of allowed capabilities. For instance, the [Subscriber](#subscriber) role has just the “[read](#read)” capability. One particular role should not be considered to be senior to another role. Rather, consider that roles define the user’s responsibilities within the site.

## [Summary of Roles](#summary-of-roles)

* [Super Admin](#super-admin) – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features. See the [Create a Network](/support/article/create-a-network/) article.
* [Administrator](#administrator) (*slug: ‘administrator’*) – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.
* [Editor](#editor) (*slug: ‘editor’*) – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
* [Author](#author)  (*slug: ‘author’*)  – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.
* [Contributor](#contributor) (*slug: ‘contributor’*) – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
* [Subscriber](#subscriber) (*slug: ‘subscriber’*) – somebody who can only manage their profile.

Upon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.

The default role for new users can be set in [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) > [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) > [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/).

## [Roles](#roles)

A Role defines a set of tasks a user assigned the role is allowed to perform. For instance, the [Super Admin](#super-admin) role encompasses every possible task that can be performed within a [Network](/support/article/glossary/#network) of virtual WordPress [sites](/support/article/glossary/#site). The [Administrator](#administrator) role limits the allowed tasks only to those which affect a single site. On the other hand, the [Author](#author) role allows the execution of just a small subset of tasks.

The following sections list the default Roles and their capabilities:

### [Super Admin](#super-admin)

Multisite Super Admins have, by default, all capabilities. The following Multisite-only capabilities are therefore only available to Super Admins:

* [create\_sites](#create_sites)
* [delete\_sites](#delete_sites)
* [manage\_network](#manage_network)
* [manage\_sites](#manage_sites)
* [manage\_network\_users](#manage_network_users)
* [manage\_network\_plugins](#manage_network_plugins)
* [manage\_network\_themes](#manage_network_themes)
* [manage\_network\_options](#manage_network_options)
* [upgrade\_network](#upgrade_network)
* [setup\_network](#setup_network)

In the case of single site WordPress installation, Administrators are, in effect, Super Admins. As such, they are the only ones to have access to [additional admin capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#additional-admin-capabilities).

### [Administrator](#administrator)

The capabilities of Administrators differs between single site and [Multisite](/support/article/glossary/#multisite) WordPress installations. All administrators have the following capabilities:

* [activate\_plugins](#activate_plugins)
* [delete\_others\_pages](#delete_others_pages)
* [delete\_others\_posts](#delete_others_posts)
* [delete\_pages](#delete_pages)
* [delete\_posts](#delete_posts)
* [delete\_private\_pages](#delete_private_pages)
* [delete\_private\_posts](#delete_private_posts)
* [delete\_published\_pages](#delete_published_pages)
* [delete\_published\_posts](#delete_published_posts)
* [edit\_dashboard](#edit_dashboard)
* [edit\_others\_pages](#edit_others_pages)
* [edit\_others\_posts](#edit_others_posts)
* [edit\_pages](#edit_pages)
* [edit\_posts](#edit_posts)
* [edit\_private\_pages](#edit_private_pages)
* [edit\_private\_posts](#edit_private_posts)
* [edit\_published\_pages](#edit_published_pages)
* [edit\_published\_posts](#edit_published_posts)
* [edit\_theme\_options](#edit_theme_options)
* [export](#export)
* [import](#import)
* [list\_users](#list_users)
* [manage\_categories](#manage_categories)
* [manage\_links](#manage_links)
* [manage\_options](#manage_options)
* [moderate\_comments](#moderate_comments)
* [promote\_users](#promote_users)
* [publish\_pages](#publish_pages)
* [publish\_posts](#publish_posts)
* [read\_private\_pages](#read_private_pages)
* [read\_private\_posts](#read_private_posts)
* [read](#read)
* [remove\_users](#remove_users)
* [switch\_themes](#switch_themes)
* [upload\_files](#upload_files)
* [customize](#customize)
* [delete\_site](#delete_site)

#### Additional Admin Capabilities

* [update\_core](#update_core)
* [update\_plugins](#update_plugins)
* [update\_themes](#update_themes)
* [install\_plugins](#install_plugins)
* [install\_themes](#install_themes)

### [Special Cases](#special-cases)

The following capabilities are special cases:

* [unfiltered\_upload](#unfiltered_upload) – This capability is not available to any role by default (including Super Admins). The capability needs to be enabled by defining the following constant:

```
define( 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true );
```

With this constant defined, all roles on a single site install can be given the unfiltered\_upload capability, but only Super Admins can be given the capability on a Multisite install.

### [Capability vs. Role Table](#capability-vs-role-table)

Note that the capabilities of Administrators **differs** between single site and [Multisite](/support/article/glossary/#multisite) WordPress installations, [as described above](#additional-admin-capabilities) .

## Advisory:

# Stored XSS in Plotly allows less privileged users to insert arbitrary JavaScript into posts

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 9, 2015

This plugin allows users who do not have the [unfiltered\_html](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#unfiltered_html) capability to insert JavaScript into posts/pages which gets executed by the browsers of other users.

On single sites, only Administrators have the unfiltered\_html capability, and on multisite, only Super Admins have this capability. This means that e.g. malicious Admins on a multisite, or malicious Editors would be able to perform XSS attacks against other site users and visitors.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 6.5 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Low |
| Authentication | Single |
| Confidentiality | Partial |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | Partial |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

1. Create a new post as a user (without the unfiltered\_html capability)
2. Switch to text mode
3. Place this link on a line by itself: https://plot.ly/~a/’onerror=’alert(1)’>
4. View the post

## Advisory timeline

* 2015-06-04: Discovered
* 2015-07-09: Reported to vendor via the contact form on the Plotly Enterprise site
* 2015-07-09: Requested CVE
* 2015-07-10: Vendor responded and confirmed fixed in 1.0.3
* 2015-07-13: Published

## Mitigation/further actions

Upgrade to version 1.0.3 or later.

N.B. If all accounts are trusted, or all accounts have the [unfiltered\_html](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#unfiltered_html) capability, then there is no issue.
