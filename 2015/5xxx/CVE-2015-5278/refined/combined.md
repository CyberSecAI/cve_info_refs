Hi everyone,

As part of recent planning around stable releases discussed during
KVM Forum, I'm releasing the first of what will be regular (hopefully
not *too* regular) CVE-only stable updates. These updates are
intended to reduce the gap between vulnerability disclosures and
patched/packaged releases.

You can grab the latest release here:

  <http://wiki.qemu.org/download/qemu-2.4.0.1.tar.bz2>

Please see the changelog for CVE numbers/details. Users are
encouraged to update as soon as possible.

v2.4.0.1 is now tagged in the official qemu.git repository,
and the stable-2.4 branch has been updated accordingly:

  <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/stable-2.4>

These CVE-only releases are produced as-needed and are on no set
release schedule.

Full stable releases are still tentatively planned to continue as they
(mostly) have in the past: 1 mid-cycle stable update, and 1 stable update
at the end of each release cycle, with freeze dates announced in advance
to pull together important fixes. v2.4.1 is currently planned for
2015-10-20:

  <http://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/2.4>

Thank you to everyone involved!

CHANGELOG:

83c92b4: Update version for 2.4.0.1 release (Michael Roth)
5a1ccdf: net: avoid infinite loop when receiving packets(CVE-2015-5278) (P J P)
7aa2bca: net: add checks to validate ring buffer pointers(CVE-2015-5279) (P J P)
3a56af1: e1000: Avoid infinite loop in processing transmit descriptor
(CVE-2015-6815) (P J P)
efec4dc: vnc: fix memory corruption (CVE-2015-5225) (Gerd Hoffmann)

Subject: CVE-2015-5278 Qemu: net: avoid infinite loop when receiving
 packets

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the NE2000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an
infinite loop issue. It could occur when receiving packets over the network.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:

## Security Advisory 0014 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1188-security-advisory-14?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** September 23rd, 2015

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | September 23rd, 2015 | Initial release |
| 1.1 | August 11th, 2023 | Updated discovered EOS version (4.12.1) |

**Arista Products vulnerability report for security released for QEMU between August 27th and September 15th, 2015**

The Fedora project issued a series of vulnerabilities for QEMU that affect the Arista family of products and EOS.

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator used natively in Fedora based systems. All shipping releases of Arista EOS have a feature to host guest virtual machines. This feature uses the QEMU process in the Linux kernel which makes EOS vulnerable if all of the following conditions are present:

* A virtual machine is configured and is running on EOS
* Untrusted users are allowed access to the virtual machine hosted on EOS although they may not have access to the EOS CLI.

The list of virtual machines hosted by EOS can be viewed by running the command ‘show virtual-machines’. The vulnerability is applicable only to the QEMU component and hence only switches hosting VMs in EOS are affected.

This advisory documents the vulnerability status of Arista 7000 Products and Arista EOS in response to the vulnerabilities listed below:

CVE-2015-5239 Qemu: VNC display driver in Qemu is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | An integer overflow issue was found in the VNC display driver of the QEMU emulator, which could be used by a privileged guest user to create a denial of service attack. The integer overflow led to an infinite loop inside the VNC driver, eventually crashing the QEMU process on the switch. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 132460 tracks this issue. Issue was discovered in version 4.12.1.Upgrading to software versions 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue. |

CVE-2015-5278 (qemu: net: avoid infinite loop when receiving packets)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | A flaw was found where a QEMU emulator built with NE2000 NIC emulation support was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue that occurred when receiving packets over the network. A privileged user inside a guest (VM) could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in a denial of service for QEMU users. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 132492 tracks this issue. Issue was discovered in version 4.12.1.Upgrading to software versions 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue. |

CVE-2015-5279 (qemu: Heap overflow vulnerability in ne2000\_receive() function)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details | A flaw was found where a QEMU emulator built with NE2000 NIC emulation support was vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow issue that occurred when receiving packets over the network. A privileged user inside a guest (VM) could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance (denial of service) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the switch. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 132493 tracks this issue. Issue was discovered in version 4.12.1.Upgrading to software versions 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue. |

CVE-2015-6815 (qemu: net: e1000 infinite loop issue)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details | A flaw was found in the way a QEMU-emulated e1000 network interface card processed transmit descriptor data when sending a network packet. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest (VM on switch) |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 132494 tracks this issue. Issue was discovered in version 4.12.1.Upgrading to software versions 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue. |

CVE-2015-6855 (qemu: ide: divide by zero issue)

| Vulnerability Status: | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| Details: | It has been discovered that a QEMU emulator built with IDE disk and CD/DVD-ROM emulation support is vulnerable to a divide-by-zero issue. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in a denial of service for QEMU users. |
| Mitigation: | Ensure only trusted users have access to the guest VMs hosted on the switch |
| Solution: | Bug 132496 tracks this issue. Issue was discovered in version 4.12.1.Upgrading to software versions 4.12.2 and newer will resolve the issue. |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Lian Yihan discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain payload

messages in the VNC display driver. A malicious guest could use this issue

to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-5239](/security/CVE-2015-5239))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled receiving certain

packets in the NE2000 network driver. A malicious guest could use this

issue to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-5278](/security/CVE-2015-5278))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled receiving certain

packets in the NE2000 network driver. A malicious guest could use this

issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on

the host as the user running the QEMU process. In the default installation,

when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt

AppArmor profile. ([CVE-2015-5279](/security/CVE-2015-5279))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled transmit descriptor

data when sending network packets. A malicious guest could use this issue

to cause the QEMU process to hang, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-6815](/security/CVE-2015-6815))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled ATAPI command

permissions. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause the QEMU

process to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-6855](/security/CVE-2015-6855))

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PULL 3/3] net: avoid infinite loop when receiving packets(CVE-2015-5278) |
| **Date**: | Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:02:31 +0100 |

```
From: P J P <address@hidden>

Ne2000 NIC uses ring buffer of NE2000_MEM_SIZE(49152)
bytes to process network packets. While receiving packets
via ne2000_receive() routine, a local 'index' variable
could exceed the ring buffer size, leading to an infinite
loop situation.
