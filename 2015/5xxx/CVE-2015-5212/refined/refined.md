  "CVE-2015-5212": {
    "description": "A crafted ODF document can be used to create a buffer that is too small for the amount of data loaded into it, allowing an attacker to cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary code. The PrinterSetup data stored in ODF files can be of attacker-controlled variable length, but is copied into a fixed-length buffer without sufficient size checks. An integer underflow flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing PrinterSetup data was discovered.  The configuration of the LinkUpdateMode option was stored in the document. That flawed approach enabled documents to be crafted with links to plausible targets on the victims host computer. The contents of those automatically inserted after load links can be concealed in hidden sections and retrieved by the attacker if the document is saved and returned to sender, or via http requests if the user has selected lower security settings for that document.",
