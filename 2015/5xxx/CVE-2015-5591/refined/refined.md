Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a second-order SQL injection in the `ORDER BY` clause within the administrative interface of Zenphoto.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Specifically, a second-order SQL injection vulnerability exists in how the application processes user input when constructing SQL queries, particularly related to the `ORDER BY` clause in the admin area. This vulnerability arises from unsanitized input being used in SQL queries, potentially allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the database, retrieve sensitive data, or potentially modify or delete records.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated in the context provided, successful exploitation of SQL injection can sometimes lead to privilege escalation by manipulating user data or queries in a way that grants the attacker elevated access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code into fields or parameters that are used in the `ORDER BY` clause within the admin area.
*   **Second-Order:** The vulnerability is second-order, meaning that the injected code is first stored, and then executed later as part of an SQL query. This requires the attacker to have specific knowledge of how the application structures its queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **OPTIONS_RIGHTS User:** The attacker needs to be a user with `OPTIONS_RIGHTS` privileges, meaning they do not need to be an administrator to exploit this vulnerability. This is a lower privilege compared to other vulnerabilities outlined in the document that require administrator access.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives a more detailed explanation than the standard CVE description, explaining that the vulnerability is a second-order SQL injection affecting the `ORDER BY` clause in the admin area, and that it impacts users with the `OPTIONS_RIGHTS` right.
* It's worth noting that the document also discusses other security issues patched in Zenphoto 1.4.9 including other XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-5592, CVE-2015-5593, CVE-2015-5594) and a CSRF/SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2015-5595).
