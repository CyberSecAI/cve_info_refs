We didn't understand this part. Build 271 is from 2015-06-20. The
vendor made a source-code change related to the bug report today.
There were three builds that occurred after 271, but before today.
We're not sure why "< = Build 271" would be mentioned.

Use CVE-2015-5612 for the issue affecting the caption of a profile
picture. Use CVE-2015-5613 for the other issues fixed in
8a4ac533e5cd6b8f92e9ef19fbfbb2f505dc7a9a. (We haven't yet looked at
whether "caption of a profile picture" is only associated with the
_image_single.htm change.)

[![@abhi-r3v0](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9742431?u=f7630eec84e2b6d97846fe10d40a4701c1205520&v=4&size=48)](/abhi-r3v0)[abhi-r3v0](https://github.com/abhi-r3v0)opened [on Jul 21, 2015](https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/1302#issue-96320637)

Whenever a new user registers a new account on October CMS , he has an option to upload his profile picture. On uploading , he can give a caption for his image. This tab executes JavaScript. When administrator opens this user's account , the script executes ( If any script is input ) . Any user with limited privileges can inject a malicious JavaScript and even access administrator credentials via cookies. There is enough chance for an attacker to grab the credentials from any user , practically , without even the users being aware of it.

POC :

```
  <svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>

```

Input this script inside the caption tab of the image and the cookie contents pop up

Subject: CVE Request: October CMS - Stored XSS in image caption tag

Hello ,

October CMS <<https://github.com/octobercms>> , an open-source , self-hosted
Content Management System built based on the Laravel PHP Framework has been
found to be vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting attack.

*Scenario :*

When any *normal* user logs into the October CMS , he is given an option to
update his account , where there is an option to upload his profile
picture. On uploading , the user is given an option to give a caption to
the uploaded image. This tab has been found vulnerable to stored XSS.

*POC  :*

Type in :  '  *<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>*' inside the caption tab
of the image and save it. Logout of the user account and login as an
administrator. Now, simply visit the user profile (of the normal user) and
the JavaScript will be executed.

*Reporting date*           :    21st July , 2015

*Exploit Author *           :    Abhishek J M

*Vendor  Homepage   *:     <http://octobercms.com/>

*Product  Link             : *    <http://octobercms.com/download>

*Version affected         :    *Possibly all the builds  i.e ,  < = Build
271  (Changelog
<<https://github.com/octobercms/october/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>>)

*Tested on                    :  *  Linux:- Ubuntu, Debian, PHP - 5.5

This issue has been  reported  to the vendor of this product  :

<https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/1302>

Is it possible to assign CVE identifier for this issue ?

Thank you
