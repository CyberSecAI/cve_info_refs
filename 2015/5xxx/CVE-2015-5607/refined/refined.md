Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue present in the IPython Notebook's REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability**: The IPython REST API endpoints were vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This is because the server did not properly validate the origin of POST requests.
*   **Lack of Origin Validation:**  Specifically, the server was not checking the `Origin` header of incoming requests against the expected host. This allowed malicious websites to initiate POST requests to the IPython server on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Inadequate Protection:** The vulnerability stems from the server's reliance on the `Origin` header for CSRF protection, and not enforcing it when the header is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Possible Remote Execution:** Although not directly stated, the ability to make arbitrary API requests opens up the possibility of remote code execution.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could potentially use the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of the user, like modifying files, starting kernels, and potentially other actions available via the REST API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary attack vector is a malicious web page on a different domain making non-AJAX POST requests to known IPython URLs.
*   **Browser Exploitation:** The user's browser automatically sends IPython cookies with the requests, allowing the malicious requests to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External Website:** An attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into another website.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the attacker's malicious page while logged into an IPython Notebook instance.
*   **Knowledge of IPython API:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the IPython API to craft the malicious POST requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected API paths:** The following API paths are explicitly listed as being affected:
    *   `POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>`
    *   `POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints`
    *   `POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints/<checkpoint_id>`
    *   `POST /api/kernels`
    *   `POST /api/kernels/<kernel_id>/<action>`
    *   `POST /api/sessions`
    *  `POST /api/clusters/<cluster_id>/<action>`
*   **Patches:** The patches introduce an origin check mechanism, which validates the `Host` and `Origin` headers. The code checks if the origin matches the host or is allowed via CORS settings. If the headers are missing, the request is treated as safe (e.g., a script).
*  The fix implemented adds a `check_origin_api` function that performs the following checks:
    1. If `allow_origin` is set to '*', the request is allowed.
    2. If either `Host` or `Origin` headers are not provided, the request is allowed, under the assumption it comes from a script or curl.
    3. The `Origin` header is parsed to get the host, and it is checked if it matches the `Host` header.
    4. Checks if the `Origin` matches the value of `allow_origin`, or if it matches the regular expression given by `allow_origin_pat`
* If all checks fail the request is blocked.

In summary, CVE-2015-5607 describes a CSRF vulnerability in the IPython Notebook REST API due to insufficient origin validation. This allowed attackers to potentially execute arbitrary commands by tricking authenticated users into making unauthorized requests. The provided content gives more detail than the original CVE description by specifying which API endpoints are affected and the exact mechanism of the vulnerability.
