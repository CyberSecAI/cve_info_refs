Use CVE-2015-5607.

This part of the patch seems unusual, but we haven't researched it at all:

  host = self.request.headers.get("Host")
  origin = self.request.headers.get("Origin")

  # If no header is provided, assume it comes from a script/curl.
  # We are only concerned with cross-site browser stuff here.
  if origin is None or host is None:
     return True

Is this a case where it is safe to skip CSRF protection in all
situations where the client omits an Origin header?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1243842#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 12:56:11 UTC  ``` POST requests exposed via the IPython REST API are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Web pages on different domains can make non-AJAX POST requests to known IPython URLs, and IPython will honor them. The user's browser will automatically send IPython cookies along with the requests. The response is blocked by the Same-Origin Policy, but the request isn't.  API paths with issues:  * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file> * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints * POST /api/contents/<path>/<file>/checkpoints/<checkpoint_id> * POST /api/kernels * POST /api/kernels/<kernel_id>/<action> * POST /api/sessions * POST /api/clusters/<cluster_id>/<action>  Upstream fixes:  2.x: <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/a05fe052a18810e92d9be8c1185952c13fe4e5b0>  3.x: <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/1415a9710407e7c14900531813c15ba6165f0816>  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/92>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1243842#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-07-16 12:57:01 UTC  ```  Created ipython tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1243843](show_bug.cgi?id=1243843 "CLOSED ERRATA - ipython: iptyhon: cross-site request forgery in get_origin() [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1243844](show_bug.cgi?id=1243844 "CLOSED EOL - ipython: iptyhon: cross-site request forgery in get_origin() [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1243842#c2)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-30 00:46:30 UTC  ``` ipython-2.4.1-7.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.
