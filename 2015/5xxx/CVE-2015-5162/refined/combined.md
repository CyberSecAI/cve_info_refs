But after reinvestigating the source code, we found that the workaround is insufficient if cinder uses EMC as backend.  In _shutdown_instance(), nova calls terminate_connection() before calling detach().      ------------------nova/compute/manager.py----------------     def _shutdown_instance(self, context, instance,         ......         for bdm in vol_bdms:             try:                 # NOTE(vish): actual driver detach done in driver.destroy, so                 #             just tell cinder that we are done with it.                 connector = self.driver.get_volume_connector(instance)                 self.volume_api.terminate_connection(context,                                                      bdm.volume_id,                                                      connector)                 self.volume_api.detach(context, bdm.volume_id)     ---------------------------------------------------------  We have to call "os-terminate_connection" API before calling "os-detach", because EMC-backend executes some operations including the removing an export for a volume when terminate_connection() is called.      ------------cinder/volume/drivers/emc/emc_vnx_cli.py-----     def terminate_connection(self, volume, connector):         """Disallow connection from connector."""          @lockutils.synchronized('emc-connection-' + connector['host'],                                 "emc-connection-", True)         def do_terminate_connection():             hostname = connector['host']             volume_name = volume['name']             lun_id = self.get_lun_id(volume)             lun_map = None             conn_info = None         ...                 if lun_id in lun_map:                     self._client.remove_hlu_from_storagegroup(                         lun_map[lun_id], hostname)                     lun_map.pop(lun_id)         ...             if self.destroy_empty_sg and not lun_map:                 try:                     LOG.info(_LI("Storage Group %s was empty."), hostname)                     self._client.disconnect_host_from_storage_group(                         hostname, hostname)                     self._client.delete_storage_group(hostname)                     if self.itor_auto_dereg:                         self._deregister_initiators(connector)     ---------------------------------------------------------  So we think we should call "os-terminate_connection" before calling os-detach.  But "os-terminate_connection" API requires the connecting information generated by nova-compute.    2016-01-29 10:39:42,643.643 68373 DEBUG cinder.api.openstack.wsgi   ...

This error actually suggests that cinder-api was down when nova-compute attempted to call terminate_connection for a volume.  I'm reassigning this bug to the cinder team to see if they agree with the following answers :      >   1. Could Red Hat fix this issue in OSP7?  If cinder-api was down when nova-compute attempted to call terminate_connection then there really isn't anything to fix on the Nova side.  Should Cinder be checking for volumes marked as attached, with initialised connections that are no longer used by Nova and cleaning these up once it restarts? Or should this be a manual admin operation using os-force_detach?  >   2. Could you tell me what operation the customer can do in order to re-use the volume on they current system?  This is more of a question for the Cinder team but AFAIK it would be better if the customer could use a single call to os-force_detach.  Unfortunately the version provided in OSP 7 / Kilo does not call terminate_connection with a valid connector, as required by the customers backend to unmap the previous compute host from the backing LUN. The following change allowed for the connector to be provided to os-force_detach in Miktaka :  force_detach terminate_connection needs connector <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/213867/>  > How reproducible: > It is a timing problem, but it's able to frequently reproduce. >  > Steps to Reproduce: > 1.

### Bug Description

Reported via private E-mail from Richard W.M. Jones.

Turns out qemu image parser is not hardened against malicious input and can be abused to allocated an arbitrary amount of memory and/or dump a lot of information when used with "--output=json".

The solution seems to be: limit qemu-img ressource using ulimit.

Example of abuse:

-- afl1.img --

$ /usr/bin/time qemu-img info afl1.img

image: afl1.img

[...]

0.13user 0.19system 0:00.36elapsed 92%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 642416maxresident)k

0inputs+0outputs (0major+156927minor)pagefaults 0swaps

The original image is 516 bytes, but it causes qemu-img to allocate 640 MB.

-- afl2.img --

$ qemu-img info --output=json afl2.img | wc -l

589843

This is a 200K image which causes qemu-img info to output half a

million lines of JSON (14 MB of JSON).

Glance runs the --output=json variant of the command.

-- afl3.img --

$ /usr/bin/time qemu-img info afl3.img

image: afl3.img

[...]

0.09user 0.35system 0:00.47elapsed 94%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1262388maxresident)k

0inputs+0outputs (0major+311994minor)pagefaults 0swaps

qemu-img allocates 1.3 GB (actually, a bit more if you play with

ulimit -v). It appears that you could change it to allocate

arbitrarily large amounts of RAM.

FYI, I tested a recentish git master to see if I can trigger it and was succesful:

What I did was

$ cd /usr/bin

 $ mv qemu-img qemu-img.real

$ cat > qemu-img <<EOF

  #!/bin/sh

echo "$@" >> /tmp/usage.log

  /usr/bin/time /usr/bin/qemu-img.real "$@" 2>> /tmp/usage.log

  echo >> /tmp/usage.log

  EOF

$ chmod +x qemu-img

Then

$ glance image-create --name afl3 --disk-format vmdk --container-format bare --file /home/berrange/afl3.img --is-public true

Glance did not appear to run qemu-img info at this stage, but when I then boot the image iwth Nova:

$ nova boot --image afl3 --flavor m1.tiny afl3

Nova correctly refuses to boot the guest, because the disk image is larger

than the maximum it permits:

However in checking that maximum limit, it has indeed run qemu-img info

and suffered the memory usage DOS.

$ cat /tmp/usage.log

info /home/berrange/src/cloud/data/nova/instances/\_base/30854c86815b92c21c8af45cf8ff5757c04046aa.part

 0inputs+0outputs (0major+311876minor)pagefaults 0swaps

So someone needs to see just what code paths in glance might trigger the qemu-img info call. I also wonder if there is any risk to cinder, because it too has various invokations of qemu-img

FYI, I tested a recentish git master to see if I can trigger it and was succesful:
What I did was
$ cd /usr/bin
$ mv qemu-img qemu-img.real
$ cat > qemu-img <<EOF

echo >> /tmp/usage.log
EOF
$ chmod +x qemu-img
Then
$ glance image-create --name afl3 --disk-format vmdk --container-format bare --file /home/berrange/afl3.img --is-public true

So someone needs to see just what code paths in glance might trigger the qemu-img info call. I also wonder if there is any risk to cinder, because it too has various invokations of qemu-img

Since this report concerns a possible security risk, an incomplete security advisory task has been added while the core security reviewers for the affected project or projects confirm the bug and discuss the scope of any vulnerability along with potential solutions.

Projects security liaison and original reporter have been subscribe.

While being an issue in a dependency (qemu), it's not clear whenever OpenStack is really missing restriction on the qemu-img process...

However, depending on what a malicious user can effectively do with this issue, we may want to consider this OSSA worthy. Thought ?

Excellent catch! And thanks for bringing this up, Richard. I was going to do some testing myself this week and file a corresponding bug.

This is a valid concern and something that we realized after the code was merged. One more point to consider here is that we need to run qemu-img in a sandbox vs. directly as a "glance" user on the the API node as possible in certain configurations. A approach for fixing this could be, using a chroot environment.

> However, depending on what a malicious user can effectively do with this issue, we may want to consider this OSSA worthy. Thought ?

From Nova's POV I consider it to be OSSA worthy. Nova uses flavours to limit the amount of RAM that a user may consume. So if using the m1.tiny flavour, a guest is supposed to only have 500 MB RAM usage. The scheduler will consider this when deciding if a host has sufficient free RAM to run the guest. Now regardless of what the flavour limit is set to, the unprivileged user can consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the host by uploading a malicious disk image. This is enough to cause OOM on the compute host and so affect running of other tenants VMs in a negative way.

This is the simplest patch I could come up with for limiting qemu-img info commands. There are various other qemu-img commands run, eg to create snapshots and the like, but I believe checking the qemu-img info command is sufficient as it is used to validate images after obtaining them from glance.

The alternative approach is to modify oslo.concurrency processutils.execute method to allow limits to be passed in explicitly, and then use the pre-exec function to set them between fork + exec. This is actually the more desirable architectural approach, but I didn't go that way, since while it is fine for master, it would not be something that's easily backported to stable branches due to the need to update the min required oslo.concurrency version dependancy.

Draft impact description:

Title: Malicious input to qemu-img may result in resource exhaustion

Reporter: Richard W.M. Jones

Product: Nova, Cinder, Glance

Affects:

    Cinder: 2013.1.0 versions through 2015.1.0,

    Glance: 2015.1.0

Description:

Richard W.M. Jones of Red Hat reported a vulnerability that affects several

OpenStack projects including Nova, Glance, and Cinder. By providing a

maliciously crafted disk image an attacker can consume considerable amounts

of RAM and CPU time resulting in a denial of service via resource exhaustion.

Any project which makes calls to qemu-img without appropriate ulimit restrictions

in place is affected by this flaw.

  [Edit](/ossa/%2Bbug/1449062/%2Battachment/4493554)
  (11.7 KiB,
  text/plain)

I've attached another patch which this time uses the new preexec\_fn feature of oslo.concurrency 2.3.0.

This patch is \*UNTESTED\* beyond running the unit tests, so don't assume this actually fixes the problem without testing it in real world.

The way <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/209627/> applied the limits to qemu-img was by setting rlimits in between fork() and execve(). The problem with this is that before we reach exec() we have a full copy-on-write mapping of the nova python process. So if Nova memory usage is too high, this could tickle the limit we're setting for qemu-img.

The only way to avoid this is to \*not\* set limits until after we have exec'd. This would require using an external command like my original prlimit patch.

Since not all distros have prlimit, we could create a simple nova-prlimit python script todo this. We would use native prlimit if it was present in the distro (as its fast) and fallacck to nova-prlimit if missing.

It is a shame oslo.concurrency went for the preexec\_fn approach, rather than my suggestion of explicitly representing resource limits in the API, as that would have allowed us to hide this compat code in oslo.concurrency, instead of dealing with it in nova, glance and cinder :-(

Following discussion with Sean and Hemanth, it looks like we ought to get fixes for this into supported branches of Cinder and Glance after all. Hopefully getting them merged goes quickly now that Nova has already trodden this ground and the fixes are basically identical between them.

Assuming all fixes merge before Newton releases and prior to any stable branch point releases, this is the updated proposed impact description. I'm using our YAML format here both for convenience and clarity due to the number of repos and releases involved. I've also shortened the title and referenced the affected software in it.

Should I include a note about the updated versions of oslo.concurrency required, or are the references to patches in consuming projects sufficient for this purpose? I'd like to avoid unnecessary additional complexity if possible here.

Thank you for that info Jeremy, I've targetted it to the appropriate series in Glance so it's clear.

Limit memory & CPU when running qemu-img info

It was found that a modified or corrupted image file can cause a DoS

    on the host when getting image info with qemu-img.

This uses the newer 'prlimit' parameter for oslo.concurrency execute

    to set an address space limit of 1GB and CPU time limit of 2 seconds

    when running the qemu-img info command.

commit 8547444775e406a50d9d26a0003e9ba6554b0d70

Author: Sean McGinnis <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Sep 22 15:31:37 2016 -0500

Limit memory & CPU when running qemu-img info

It was found that a modified or corrupted image file can cause a DoS

    on the host when getting image info with qemu-img.

This uses the newer 'prlimit' parameter for oslo.concurrency execute

    to set an address space limit of 1GB and CPU time limit of 2 seconds

    when running the qemu-img info command.

It's just a theory (credits to Brian Rosmaita) at this point, but looks like "qemu-img convert" will try to infer the format of input image if "-f" is not provided. So, "qemu-img convert" may be susceptible to the same attack. Any thoughts?

Yes, \*any\* qemu-img command that you run without providing '-f' will try to guess the image format. Rather than trying to figure out whether a particular invokation may or may not be susceptible to attack, the safe approach is to use '-f' every time.

Jeremy, the impact description looks good. Though note that prlimit implementation before oslo.concurrency-3.8.0 doesn't support all the required resources limit, thus I would mention that oslo.concurrency>=3.8.0 is required to fix that issue.

Hemanth, Daniel: So that means the current patches to Nova are insufficient because they missed `qemu-image convert` invocations? For example at <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/virt/xenapi/vm_utils.py#n1128>

Tristan: Thanks, it looked like oslo.concurrency got backports to stable/mitaka and stable/liberty to support it too though. Is that correct? If so we may need to get much more verbose about the library versions required by the service fixes.

Jeremy: Hemanth (in comment#72) seems to have mixed up this bug (which sets limits for memory / CPU usage for `qemu-img` calls) with \*another\* bug[x] that is about disk image format guessing.

So, the Nova patches that fix this bug (1449062) are sufficient for the problem it is solving (setting a cap on memory / CPU usage).

Thanks Kashyap.

That bug isn't cross listed with Glance and the current one applies to Glance in a very generic way. So, Hemanth did the right thing from our perspective. I will leave the rest of the story to the VMT team.

Jeremy, the missing bit for oslo-concurrency 3.7.1 is <https://review.openstack.org/#/q/I164c4b35e1357a0f80ed7fe00a7ae8f49df92e31> and it was merged to stable branches. Fortunately it seems like all version >= 3.8.0 are good enough to support correct resources limit, so I guess we could just mention that.

Tristan: I'm still a little confused on the oslo.concurrency recommendation. Are you saying that we should suggest stable/liberty and stable/mitaka deployments to also use oslo.concurrency>=3.8.0? At the moment the tips of stable/liberty and stable/mitaka branches for oslo.concurrency are tagged 2.6.1 and 3.7.1 respectively (and that's what we have pinned in upper-constraints.txt for testing purposes as well). I don't want to imply in an advisory that all deployments should upgrade oslo.concurrency to 3.8.0 or later if there's a risk it will break liberty or mitaka deployments (which is why I was leaning toward not mentioning oslo.concurrency versions as that would just add to confusion).

I had the same question for mitaka, so had to dig a little deeper. oslo.concurrency 3.7.1 was the follow on release to 3.7.0 to include the prlimit option. So based on current requirements for stable/mitaka, it should be safe to backport this fix.

I did not investigate stable/liberty, but I'm assuming 2.6.1 is the same situation.

Indeed my bad, oslo-concurrency 2.6.1, 3.7.1 and 3.8.0 are all good and referenced in the upper-constraint of supported stable branches. Thus I agree we could omit that note on the advisory.

commit 58311904a73f931404416649dc6ed3958adc59c8

Author: Brian Rosmaita <email address hidden>

Date: Tue Sep 27 16:11:17 2016 -0400

Adding constraints around qemu-img calls

\* All "qemu-img info" calls are now run under resource limitations that

      limit CPU time to 2 seconds and address space usage to 1 GB. This

      helps avoid any DoS attacks via malicious images.

    \* All "qemu-img convert" calls now specify the import format so that it

      does not have to be inferred by qemu-img.

SecurityImpact

(Hemanth did all the work on this, I'm just doing the backport.)

Status update: it looks like all Glance and Nova fixes have merged; so too have the master and stable/newton changes for Cinder. At this point we're waiting for <https://review.openstack.org/375625> (Cinder's stable/mitaka fix) to merge, and we don't seem to have a stable/liberty backport for Cinder.

Sean: were you planning to work on a liberty change for this? Or is stable/liberty of Cinder unaffected (in which case I need to adjust the impact description accordingly)?

I think the impact description is good. I will push through those backports.

Limit memory & CPU when running qemu-img info

It was found that a modified or corrupted image file can cause a DoS

    on the host when getting image info with qemu-img.

This uses the newer 'prlimit' parameter for oslo.concurrency execute

    to set an address space limit of 1GB and CPU time limit of 2 seconds

    when running the qemu-img info command.

NetApp are keen to hear Red Hat's opinion as they are aware we have opened a case also with Red Hat support for this issue.  NetApp would like us to apply the NFS "lookupcache=pos" mount option as detailed in the Launchpad bug. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1370012#c10)  Eric Harney    2016-10-13 15:45:31 UTC  ``` I've submitted a new patch upstream which I think may be an easier workaround.  It will be waiting for review from NetApp engineers.  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/386041/>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1370012#c17)  lkuchlan    2017-01-11 08:24:29 UTC  ``` Tested

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1357461#c0)  Peng Liu    2016-07-18 09:42:05 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When using the cpu_realtime and cpu_realtim_mask flag to create new instance, the 'cpuset' of 'emulatorpin' option is using the id of vcpu which is incorrect. The id of host cpu should be used here.  e.g.   <cputune>     <vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='2'/>     <vcpupin vcpu='1' cpuset='3'/>     <emulatorpin cpuset='0'/>          ### the cpuset should be '2' here, when cpu_realtime_mask=^0.       <vcpusched vcpus='1' scheduler='fifo' priority='1'/>   </cputune>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 1:12.0.2-5.el7ost  How reproducible: Boot new instance with cpu_realtime_mask flavor.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create RT flavor nova flavor-create m1.small.performance 6 2048 20 2 nova flavor-key m1.small.performance set hw:cpu_realtime=yes nova flavor-key m1.small.performance set hw:cpu_realtime_mask=^0 nova flavor-key m1.small.performance set hw:cpu_policy=dedicated 2. Boot a instance with this flavor 3. Check the xml of the new instance  Actual results:   <cputune>     <vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='2'/>     <vcpupin vcpu='1' cpuset='3'/>     <emulatorpin cpuset='0'/>               <vcpusched vcpus='1' scheduler='fifo' priority='1'/>   </cputune>  Expected results:   <cputune>     <vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='2'/>     <vcpupin vcpu='1' cpuset='3'/>     <emulatorpin cpuset='2'/>               <vcpusched vcpus='1' scheduler='fifo' priority='1'/>   </cputune>  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1357461#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-21 16:39:33 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# RHSA-2016:2923 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder and openstack-glance security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2923)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder and openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and individually configuring additional services.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the Block Storage (cinder) and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. (CVE-2015-5162)

## Solution

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0153)

## Topic

An update for openstack-cinder is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the Block Storage (cinder) service was found in its use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. (CVE-2015-5162)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1420451#c0)  Lee Yarwood    2017-02-08 16:51:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  [bug 1351662](show_bug.cgi?id=1351662) (openstack-nova-2015.1.4-28.el7ost) mistakenly backported I9f9ead51238e27fa45084c8e3d3edee76a8b0218 [1] to OSP 7 assuming that a required dependency in the form of I793f2996fc0af1c321a240ad9348dc9bce816030 [2] had also previously been backported. However this required change had itself been reverted as part of [bug 1331299](show_bug.cgi?id=1331299) after it was found to cause additional issues. We should revert I9f9ead51238e27fa45084c8e3d3edee76a8b0218 ASAP.  [1] <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/257853/> [2] <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/266095/> [3] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331299#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331299#c6)  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-nova-2015.1.4-28.el7ost  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Launch and then shutdown an instance. 2. Shutdown the compute service hosting the instance. 3. Delete the instance.  Actual results: _local_cleanup_bdm_volumes is unable to find a valid connector and thus call terminate_connection for volumes located on down compute node. Further an exception is swallowed when calling detach with an incorrect number of arguments.  Expected results: No attempt made to terminate_connection for volumes on down compute node as I9f9ead51238e27fa45084c8e3d3edee76a8b0218 has been reverted.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1420451#c5)  Prasanth Anbalagan    2017-02-13 13:08:24 UTC  ``` Ok. Will mark this bug as VERIFIED since steps 1 to 5 verifies this bug.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1420451#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-02-15 23:00:48 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0156)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the Block Storage (cinder) service was found in its use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. (CVE-2015-5162)

Subject: [OSSA 2016-012] Malicious qemu-img input may exhaust resources in
 Cinder, Glance, Nova (CVE-2015-5162)

================================================================
OSSA-2016-012: Malicious qemu-img input may exhaust resources in
Cinder, Glance, Nova
================================================================

:Date: October 06, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2015-5162

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Cinder: <=7.0.2, >=8.0.0 <=8.1.1
- Glance: <=11.0.1, ==12.0.0
- Nova: <=12.0.4, ==13.0.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Richard W.M. Jones of Red Hat reported a vulnerability that affects
OpenStack Cinder, Glance and Nova. By providing a maliciously
crafted disk image an attacker can consume considerable amounts of
RAM and CPU time resulting in a denial of service via resource
exhaustion. Any project which makes calls to qemu-img without
appropriate ulimit restrictions in place is affected by this flaw.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0282)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova, openstack-cinder, openstack-glance, and python-oslo-concurrency is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Oslo concurrency library has utilities for safely running multi-thread, multi-process applications using locking mechanisms, and for running external processes.

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and delivery services for disk and server images. The service provides the ability to copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and individually configuring additional services.

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances.

oslo.concurrency has been updated to support process limits ('prlimit'), which is needed to fix this flaw. (CVE-2015-5162)

This issue was discovered by Richard W.M. Jones (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* qemu-img calls were unrestricted by ulimit. oslo.concurrency has been updated to add support for process limits ('prlimit'), which is needed to fix the CVE-2015-5162 security vulnerability. (BZ#1383415)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1380842#c0)  mshetty    2016-09-30 18:14:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem: With OSP9 we can now create encrypted volumes using the Horizon dashboard.   When you try the new feature with Ceph RDB as Cinder backed, and it works fine ie. It creates encrypted volumes using Horizon. Next, when you try to attach it to an instance it says it went through fine, but is not attached ie. a case of false positive.  On doing some research I found that Encryption support for RDB backend volumes was abandoned for Mitaka.  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/239798/>  I'm filing this bug as, when I tried to attach the encrypted volume to an instance it said it went through fine. It's only when you look into the instance, you see that the volume has not been attached.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Can be reproduced easily.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure OpenStack with Ceph as Cinder backend. 2. Use Horizon to create an encrypted volume. 3. Attach the volume to an instance in OpenStack. 4. Log into the instance, and check if the volume is there.  Actual results:   Expected results: If Encrypting Ceph volumes is not supported in Mitaka, then the creation of the encrypted Volume itself should fail.   It allows the creation, and attaching the volume to the instance also goes through fine. It's only when you log into the instance, you see that the volume is not there.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1380842#c2)  Paul Grist    2016-10-10 15:18:41 UTC  ``` Changing this to cinder and will triage to confirm. Not sure if this use to fail as expected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1380842#c3)  Jon Bernard    2016-10-11 15:36:36 UTC  ``` Yeah, this is not awesome.  Since cinder doesn't manage the LUKS device, it just tags the volume with metadata that nova uses for encryption at attach-time.  I'll see if there's a clean way to catch this in the RBD cinder driver and stop this false positive.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1380842#c4)  Jon Bernard    2016-11-01 19:37:11 UTC  ``` Patch merged upstream, will prepare a stable backport and downstream backports for osp 10 and 9 next.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1380842#c7)  lkuchlan    2016-12-05 14:35:19 UTC  ``` Tested using:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1198169#c0)  Eduard Barrera    2015-03-03 13:48:14 UTC  ``` Description of problem:    The bug is happening in our case with a Ceph cluster as storage backend for OpenStack. If someone is trying to delete a virtual machine with attached volumes while the sorage backend is overwhelmed or not responding, the vm is deleted but the associated volumes are remaining as "Attached to None". Once you are in this state, you can't delete them from Cinder either in CLI or from Horizon and they are still hangin in the Ceph cluster.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   ceph-common-0.80.5-4.el7ost.x86_64 openstack-cinder-2014.2.1-3.el7ost.noarch python-ceph-0.80.5-4.el7ost.x86_64 python-cinder-2014.2.1-3.el7ost.noarch python-cinderclient-1.1.1-1.el7ost.noarch   How reproducible: don't know  Steps to Reproduce: trying to delete a virtual machine with attached volumes while the sorage backend is overwhelmed or not responding, the vm is deleted but the associated volumes are remaining as "Attached to None".   Actual results: volumes are remaining as "Attached to None".  Expected results: volumes not attached  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1198169#c11)  Sergey Gotliv    2015-05-26 14:42:29 UTC  ``` It's really hard to say what exactly happened, Cinder's log is configured with severity INFO so it doesn't contain any DEBUG messages.

It is possible that that work will improve the error recovery in this case, but I don't have a lot of specifics I can provide there for now.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1198169#c29)  Sergey Gotliv    2015-10-18 14:02:43 UTC  ``` Russ,  Thanks for the update.   Let me summarize:  "attach to None" is the result, not the root cause.  Cinder folks are working to introduce "force-detach" in Mitaka to allow volumes to get back to normal after that unfortunate result. Till then, as a workaround, you have to manually update volume metadata in the Cinder DB.   If this problem happens too often then we need to get Cinder and Nova logs to understand an fix the root cause on that specific environment. Please, reopen that case if happens again on the customer env.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1198169#c33)  lkuchlan    2016-12-12 08:45:26 UTC  ``` Tested using: openstack-cinder-2014.2.4-11.el7ost.noarch python-cinderclient-1.1.1-4.el7ost.noarch python-cinder-2014.2.4-11.el7ost.noarch  Verification flow:  [root@panther13 ~(keystone_admin)]# glance image-create --disk-format iso --container-format bare --name cirros --file dsl-4.4.10.iso +------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Property         | Value                                | +------------------+--------------------------------------+ | checksum         | 5cb7e0d4506c249b78bbe0cd4695b865     | | container_format | bare                                 | | created_at       | 2016-12-12T08:05:49                  | | deleted          | False                                | | deleted_at       | None                                 | | disk_format      | iso                                  | | id               | ca0e6d96-9dd3-48e7-9b89-7596fb4abefc | | is_public        | False                                | | min_disk         | 0                                    | | min_ram          | 0                                    | | name             | cirros                               | | owner            | a9c6433306c24883a2f89e43fca9c448     | | protected        | False                                | | size             | 52328448                             | | status           | active                               | | updated_at       | 2016-12-12T08:05:49                  | | virtual_size     | None                                 | +------------------+--------------------------------------+  [root@panther13 ~(keystone_admin)]# glance image-list +--------------------------------------+---------+-------------+------------------+------------+--------+ | ID                                   | Name    | Disk Format | Container Format | Size       | Status | +--------------------------------------+---------+-------------+------------------+------------+--------+ | ca0e6d96-9dd3-48e7-9b89-7596fb4abefc | cirros  | iso         | bare             | 52328448   | active | +--------------------------------------+---------+-------------+------------------+------------+--------+  [root@panther13 ~(keystone_admin)]# nova boot --image ca0e6d96-9dd3-48e7-9b89-7596fb4abefc --flavor 1 --nic net-id=3325c72f-a537-4a3f-8952-60bd38ef00e6 vm +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | Property                             | Value                                         | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | OS-DCF:diskConfig                    | MANUAL                                        | | OS-EXT-AZ:availability_zone          |                                               | | OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host                 | -

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova, openstack-cinder, and openstack-glance is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and delivery services for disk and server images. The service provides the ability to copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and individually configuring additional services.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: openstack-nova (12.0.5), openstack-cinder (7.0.3), openstack-glance (11.0.1). (BZ#1381466, BZ#1396263)

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. (CVE-2015-5162)

This issue was discovered by Richard W.M. Jones (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* There is a known issue with Unicode string handling in the OSProfiler library. Consequently, the creation of a Block Storage (cinder) snapshot will fail if it uses non-ASCII characters. With this update, the OSProfiler library is not loaded unless it is specifically enabled in the cinder configuration. As a result, the Unicode handling issue in OSProfiler is still present, and will result in the same failure if OSProfiler is used, however it will be unlikely to occur in most cinder configurations. A more in-depth resolution for this issue is not currently in scope. (BZ#1383899)

Actual results:    --- Additional comment from Eric Harney on 2016-10-13 11:45:31 EDT ---  I've submitted a new patch upstream which I think may be an easier workaround.  It will be waiting for review from NetApp engineers.  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/386041/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1386253#c2)  nlevinki    2016-12-05 10:15:10 UTC  ``` <https://rhos-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/RHOS/view/RHOS9/job/qe-phase2-9-rhel-7.3-openstack-all-in-one-neutron-rabbitmq/7/>  openstack-cinder-8.1.1-4.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1386253#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-07 22:21:41 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Topic

An update for openstack-cinder is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations. Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource vulnerability in the Block Storage (cinder) service was found in its use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. (CVE-2015-5162)
