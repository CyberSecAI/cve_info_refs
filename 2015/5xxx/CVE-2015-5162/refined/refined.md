Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5162:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient resource restriction of the `qemu-img` command, specifically the `info` and `convert` subcommands.  A maliciously crafted disk image can exploit the image parser in `qemu-img` to allocate an arbitrary amount of memory, consume excessive CPU time, or generate a large amount of output when used with the `--output=json` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Resource Consumption:** The primary weakness is the lack of resource limits on `qemu-img` processes. This allows an attacker-controlled image to trigger excessive memory allocation, CPU usage, or output generation.
*   **Unsafe Image Parsing:** The `qemu-img` image parser is vulnerable to malicious input, particularly when inferring the format of the image.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** OpenStack components did not properly sanitize or validate the disk image before passing them to `qemu-img`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to resource exhaustion on the host system running `qemu-img`.  This can cause an out-of-memory (OOM) condition and may negatively affect other virtual machines running on the same host.
*   **System instability**: Excessive resource consumption can lead to system instability and possible crashes due to memory exhaustion or CPU overload
*   **Service disruption:**  The DoS can disrupt OpenStack services such as Glance, Cinder, and Nova, which rely on the `qemu-img` tool for image management and verification.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Disk Images:** An attacker can create a specially crafted disk image and upload it to OpenStack through Glance, Cinder, or Nova APIs.
*   **Image Import:** When operators try to import and convert images or perform checks/operations that invoke `qemu-img`, the malicious image will be processed without proper restrictions.
*  **Image Validation:** When booting an image, Nova checks for maximum size limits using `qemu-img info`, which makes it vulnerable to a DOS via a malicious disk image that will trigger excessive memory consumption while calculating image size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** An unprivileged OpenStack user with the ability to upload disk images or create volumes using specific volume types.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the OpenStack APIs for image, volume, or instance management.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The issue was initially reported by Richard W.M. Jones from Red Hat.
*   The fix involved adding resource limits to the `qemu-img` processes using `ulimit` or the `prlimit` option of `oslo.concurrency`.
*   The issue affects various OpenStack components including Glance, Cinder, and Nova.
*   The `oslo.concurrency` library was updated to support the `prlimit` parameter which allows setting resource limits before executing commands.
*   Patches were backported to stable branches of OpenStack (Liberty, Mitaka, Newton) to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can affect `qemu-img info` and `qemu-img convert` commands.
*   Red Hat rated this vulnerability as moderate in terms of security impact, but a malicious user can use it to cause OOM.
*   The fix involved changes in multiple OpenStack projects and `oslo.concurrency`.
*   The `qemu-img` format guessing vulnerability was confused with CVE-2015-5162, which is an independent vulnerability. 
* The provided script for workarounding an issue where volumes remain attached after deleting an instance due to a killed `nova-compute` was not related to CVE-2015-5162, but another issue related to volume management.
* A separate issue was discussed on how `os-force-detach` requires a valid connector for some storage backends, which is unrelated to the CVE.
