Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper path processing for command URLs accessed through the management port of the Symantec Web Gateway. A crafted URL can cause the Web Gateway to execute a command that should not be available externally.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Path Processing:** The software does not correctly validate or sanitize the path component of URLs used to access the management interface. This allows attackers to manipulate the path to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Command Injection:** By sending a specially crafted URL, an attacker can inject and execute commands directly on the underlying operating system.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring prior authentication, making it easily accessible to attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable Symantec Web Gateway.
*   **Root-Level Access:** The commands are executed under the context of the root user, giving the attacker full control over the system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker can potentially install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services, leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is network-based, meaning attackers can exploit it remotely over a network.
*   **Malicious URL:** The attack involves sending a specifically crafted URL to the management port of the Web Gateway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Symantec Web Gateway. This could be from the same network or from an external network if the management port is exposed.
*   **Crafted URL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific structure of the crafted URL that can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also mentions CVE-2015-5693, indicating a related vulnerability affecting the same product.
*   A Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS filter (ID '20630') provides protection against this vulnerability.
*   Symantec has released an update to address this vulnerability.
