| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1243571#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-15 19:42:55 UTC  ``` Dominic Cleal of Red Hat reports:  The "require_ssl" setting (in /etc/foreman/settings.yml) should enforce that web requests sent to Foreman over HTTP are redirected to HTTPS, but this was found not to happen with API requests (e.g. from Hammer CLI). Foreman will process API requests over HTTP, but should have redirected.  Redirection won't help with credentials having already been sent, but should give some notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.  Affects all versions of Foreman since 1.1.  The issue has already been fixed since Foreman 1.9.0-RC1 via a refactor in #10471.  To mitigate this with Apache, add a stanza to the HTTP VirtualHost (e.g. in /etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman.d/api_redirect.conf) similar to:  RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^/api/(.*) [https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/$1](https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/%241) [R,L]  External reference:  <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11119>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1243571#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-15 22:14:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of foreman as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6 and OpenStack.

**Description**

The "require\_ssl" setting (in /etc/foreman/settings.yml) should enforce that web requests sent to Foreman over HTTP are redirected to HTTPS, but this was found not to happen with API requests (e.g. from Hammer CLI). Foreman will process API requests over HTTP, but should have redirected.

Redirection won't help with credentials having already been sent, but should give some notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.

Affects all versions of Foreman since 1.1.

The issue has already been fixed since Foreman 1.9.0-RC1 via a refactor in [#10471](/issues/10471 "Refactor: Replace require_ssl filter with Rails' force_ssl (Closed)").

To mitigate this with Apache, add a stanza to the HTTP VirtualHost (e.g. in /etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman.d/api\_redirect.conf) similar to:

```

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/api/(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/$1 [R,L]

```
