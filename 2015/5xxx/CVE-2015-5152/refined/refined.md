{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'require_ssl' setting in Foreman did not enforce HTTPS redirection for API requests, allowing them to be processed over HTTP even when HTTPS was required.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Foreman's API did not properly enforce the 'require_ssl' setting, leading to insecure communication over HTTP instead of redirecting to HTTPS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially intercept sensitive information transmitted via the API over unencrypted HTTP connections. While redirection wouldn't help with credentials already sent, it should provide a notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending API requests to Foreman over HTTP when the 'require_ssl' setting is enabled. This can be done through tools like the Hammer CLI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Foreman API endpoint. No special privileges or system access is explicitly required."
