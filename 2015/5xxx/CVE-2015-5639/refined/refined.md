- **Man-in-the-middle:** The attack requires the attacker to be positioned in the network path between the app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device running the vulnerable app or positioned on the network path.
- **MitM positioning:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable app and the server, such as by setting up a malicious wireless access point.
