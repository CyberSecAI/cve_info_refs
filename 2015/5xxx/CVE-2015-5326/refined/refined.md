{
  "CVE-2015-5326": {
    "Description": "A stored XSS vulnerability was found in Jenkins where users with permission to take agent nodes offline could inject arbitrary HTML into the slave offline status message which would be displayed unescaped to users visiting the agent overview page.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating an offline status message for slave nodes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with the permission to take agent nodes offline can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript, which is then executed in the browsers of other Jenkins users when they view the agent overview page. This could lead to arbitrary actions being performed in the context of the victim users' session, such as stealing session cookies or redirecting them to malicious sites.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is launched by injecting malicious HTML through the 'offline status message' field when taking a slave node offline.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have permission to take agent nodes offline in Jenkins."
