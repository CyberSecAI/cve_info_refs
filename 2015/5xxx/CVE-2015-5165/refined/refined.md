{
  "CVE-2015-5165": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The QEMU model of the RTL8139 network card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload emulation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Information Leakage",
         "Uninitialized memory access"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to read up to 65 KB of uninitialized QEMU heap memory. This can lead to exposure of sensitive host-level data residing in the QEMU process, potentially including information about real devices backing emulated devices or passwords the host administrator does not intend to share with the guest admin.",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "Guest virtual machines configured with RTL8139 network card emulation."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged guest user with the ability to send network packets using a virtual RTL8139 network interface."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "QEMU's RTL8139 emulation implementation processed network packets under RTL8139 controller's C+ mode of operation without proper validation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Information leak",
        "Heap memory exposure"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged guest user could read up to 65KB of uninitialized QEMU heap memory.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Processing of network packets under RTL8139 controller's C+ mode of operation."

      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged guest user with access to the network interface."

  {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The QEMU model of the RTL8139 network card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload emulation.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
          "Information disclosure"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Uninitialized memory from the QEMU process's heap could be leaked to the domain as well as to the network.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Network traffic on a VM using RTL8139 emulation without stubdomains"
        ],
