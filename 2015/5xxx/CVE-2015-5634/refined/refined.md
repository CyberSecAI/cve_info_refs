Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a URL whitelist bypass in the MEGAPHONE MUSIC application. The application, built using "applican," does not properly restrict URL schemes, allowing an attacker to load arbitrary pages by exploiting the URL scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Whitelist Bypass:** The application fails to adequately validate URLs, permitting the loading of arbitrary pages through the URL-scheme.
- **Insufficient Access Controls:**  The application does not enforce proper restrictions on which APIs can be accessed or executed when launched via a URL scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Android:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary applican APIs if those APIs are granted permission in the Android manifest.
- **iOS:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary APIs used by the iOS application.
- **General:**  The vulnerability can lead to the execution of unauthorized code or access to restricted functionalities by loading arbitrary pages within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves exploiting the application's URL scheme. An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into opening it, thereby launching the MEGAPHONE MUSIC application with the attacker's desired page or commands.
- The attack would require the user to interact with a malicious URL that could be delivered via various methods such as phishing or malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user who has the vulnerable MEGAPHONE MUSIC app installed.
- No specific privileges or authentication is required.
