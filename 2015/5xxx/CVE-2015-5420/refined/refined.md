Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2015-5420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Hewlett-Packard KeyView IDOL handles OpenDocument Format (ODF) files.
- Specifically, it's triggered by a malformed XML structure within an ODF file. This malformed structure leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data outside the allocated memory buffer when parsing a specially crafted ODF file. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Context of the process: The arbitrary code will execute under the context of the process running KeyView IDOL, potentially gaining the privileges of that process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious ODF files: Attackers can craft a malicious ODF file containing a malformed XML structure that triggers the vulnerability.
- Malicious pages: Users must visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file to be vulnerable to attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system to exploit it.
- User interaction required: The target user must open a malicious ODF file or visit a malicious page.
