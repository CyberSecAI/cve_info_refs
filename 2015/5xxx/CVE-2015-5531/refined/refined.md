{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a path traversal flaw in the snapshot functionality of Elasticsearch. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-provided paths when creating and accessing snapshots, which are stored on the server's filesystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file download. An attacker can read files from the server's filesystem that are accessible to the Elasticsearch process.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the Elasticsearch API",
      "Manipulation of snapshot paths"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Elasticsearch instance and the ability to send HTTP requests. They also require knowledge of where the application is storing the snapshots (path.repo) and needs write access to create snapshot locations. "
  },
  "exploit": {
    "description": "The exploit utilizes the snapshot API to create a snapshot repository with a specific path. Then uses path traversal sequences in the snapshot name to access files outside the designated snapshot directory.",
        "steps": [
            "Set path.repo in elasticsearch.yml to a writable directory",
           "Create a snapshot repository with a specified location.",
           "Create a snapshot with a crafted name containing path traversal sequences (e.g., 'ev1l%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..').",
           "Request the crafted snapshot to trigger the file download."
