Based on the provided document, here's the analysis for CVE-2015-5987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Belkin N600 DB Wireless Dual Band N+ router uses predictable Transaction IDs (TXIDs) in its DNS queries. These TXIDs start at 0x0002 and increment sequentially.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:** The use of predictable, sequential TXIDs makes the router vulnerable to DNS spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can spoof DNS responses, causing the router to connect to malicious servers. This can lead to the router contacting incorrect firmware update servers or malicious NTP servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: An attacker with the ability to intercept and spoof DNS responses can exploit this vulnerability. This usually requires the attacker to be on the same network or have a position to intercept traffic between the router and its DNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify DNS traffic. This typically means being on the same local network as the router or being positioned on the path of the network traffic.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send spoofed DNS responses.
