Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader handles arguments passed to the `makeMeasurement` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent State:** A specially crafted argument to the `makeMeasurement` method can leave objects in an inconsistent state. This indicates a flaw in input validation or object handling within the method.
- **Information Disclosure:** The inconsistent state caused by the flawed `makeMeasurement` call can be exploited to disclose sensitive information by later calling `dumpMeasureData`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information about the current process. This could potentially include memory layout data, internal configurations, or other process-specific details that could be used in subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file (e.g., a specially crafted PDF).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious input to the `makeMeasurement` function to cause the inconsistent state and be able to trigger the dump of the data.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious content to the victim (through a webpage or file).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2015-03-18 and publicly disclosed on 2015-07-29.
- Adobe released an update to fix this issue.
- This vulnerability was discovered during the Pwn2Own competition, indicating it was a non-trivial vulnerability.
