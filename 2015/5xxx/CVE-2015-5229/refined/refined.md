{
  "ID": "CVE-2015-5229",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "The calloc implementation in glibc could return memory areas which contain non-zero bytes. This could result in unexpected application behavior such as hangs or crashes.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the `calloc` implementation of glibc.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The `calloc` function, which is supposed to return zero-initialized memory, may return memory that is not completely zeroed out.",
      "This can cause unpredictable application behavior, leading to crashes or hangs."
    ],
    "impact": "Unexpected application behavior, including hangs or crashes due to uninitialized memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by applications using `calloc`.",
      "This vulnerability does not require any specific attacker capabilities, it is a general flaw in the library."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed. Any application using calloc could be affected if it does not anticipate non-zeroed memory."
  }
