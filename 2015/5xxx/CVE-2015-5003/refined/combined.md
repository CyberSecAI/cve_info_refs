* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Currently when a Tivoli Portal user has "Take Action"
  authority, the dialog used for passing arguments with an
  action,  command allows for inclusion of additional characters
  in the text field.

  RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
  Select an action command that accepts parameters, a dialog will
  appear which is an editable freeform field.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  Remove the "Take Action" authority from the Tivoli Portal user
  account.

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  Currently when a Tivoli Portal user has "Take Action" authority,
   the dialog used for passing arguments with an action command:
  'Edit Argument Values' pop-up, allows for inclusion of
  additional characters in the text field. By this APAR fix, the
  administrator is able to list the characters that are not
  allowed in this field.

  In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
  environment, a new environment variable has been added.  See the
  "Install Actions" section of the APAR conclusion for more
  details.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Code was changed to exclude characters in take action text field
   by 'KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS' variable.

  When a Tivoli Portal user has "view" authority to run take
  action commands, if a command is defined to prompt the user for
  additional input then the Edit Argument Values window is
  displayed. Currently the user can provide specially crafted
  input which can result in additional command(s) being executed.
  This APAR will exclude specific characters from being used as
  input to the dialog.

  Install Actions:
  To fully enable this APAR, the following post installation steps
  should be completed:

   1. A new environment variable
  KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS will be needed in the kfwenv
  file (Windows) or cq.ini file (Linux/UNIX). This variable should
  list the set of characters that are not allowed to be entered
  into the Edit Argument Values when a user has "view" authority.
  For example, to restrict the values ";" or "&" or "|", add the
  environment variable using the format below:

      On Windows: Open kfwenv in <CANDLEHOME>\CNPS, define
      KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS.
           KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS=;&|

      On Linux/UNIX:  Open cq.ini in <CANDLEHOME>/config, define
      KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS.
           KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS=;&|

  Save the file (the change will not take effect until the Tivoli
  Enterprise Portal is restarted in step #2 below).

  The list of characters can be customized by the administrator if
  additional characters want to be added to the exclude list. Once
  this value is set and the portal server recycled, a user with
  view authority to run a take action will no longer be able to
  enter those characters into the Edit Arguments dialog box.

   2. After adding the environment variable
  KFW_TAKE_ACTION_EXCLUDE_CHARACTERS above, the portal server
  needs to be restarted.

   3. The Java plugin jar cache needs to be cleared on all
  desktops that run the Tivoli Enterprise Portal client.
      - From the Windows control panel, double-click the Java icon
  that represents the Java control panel.
      - Select the "General" tab, press the "settings" button,
  then press the "Delete files" button to clear currently cached
  applications.
      - The next time the Tivoli Enterprise Portal client is
  started the newly patched jar files in this fix will be
  downloaded.

   4. Restart the Tivoli Enterprise Portal client.

  The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
  packages:

     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0007
