**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the MATCHA INVOICE web-based billing management software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The software is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into input fields, which is then executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers may be able to alter the data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The software is vulnerable to attacks over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor released version 2.5.7 to address this issue, which includes not only SQL injection fixes but also a fix for a code injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 6.5 (Medium).
- The report mentions the specific versions affected (2.5.6 and earlier).
- There is also a mention of "blind SQL injection," indicating that the attacker might not see the results of the SQL queries directly in the application's responses, but can still infer results based on timing or other application behavior.
