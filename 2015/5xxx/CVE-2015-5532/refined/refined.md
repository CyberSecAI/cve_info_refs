Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5532:

**Verification:**

The commit message in the github content, specifically "SECURITY PATCH: Fixes to Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities in the â€¦ PMPro settings pages in the WordPress dashboard. [Advisory ID HTB23264]", directly relates to the vulnerability addressed by CVE-2015-5532, which is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Paid Memberships Pro plugin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's displayed on the Paid Memberships Pro settings pages within the WordPress admin dashboard. Specifically, the commit diffs show that the plugin was using `echo` directly to output data retrieved from the database or user inputs, instead of using functions like `esc_attr` and `esc_textarea`, which would sanitize the data and prevent it from being interpreted as malicious code in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Unsanitized input was being directly outputted, enabling an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that could be executed in the browsers of other administrators.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness was that the plugin was not properly sanitizing data coming from options or user input before rendering it in the admin dashboard. This allowed attackers to inject malicious script into various input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that could be executed in the context of an administrator's session. This allows for actions like changing user privileges, modifying site content, or potentially installing backdoors on the WordPress site.
*   **Data Theft:** XSS could be used to steal session cookies or other sensitive data from administrators, leading to further unauthorized access.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could inject code that could deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Settings Pages:** The vulnerability is present in multiple settings pages within the Paid Memberships Pro plugin's administration area. The attacker would need to access vulnerable settings and insert malicious code.
*   **Input Fields:** The attack is executed by inserting malicious javascript into the forms for settings such as reCAPTCHA keys, custom text areas, discount codes, and membership levels fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Admin Access:**  The attacker needs to have administrative level access to the WordPress site to access the vulnerable settings pages of the Paid Memberships Pro plugin.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable fields:** Attacker needs to know which input fields to exploit to execute the javascript.

**Technical Details from the Commit:**

The commit diffs show changes to several files:

*   **`adminpages/advancedsettings.php`**:  The fix changes output of `recaptcha_publickey`, `recaptcha_privatekey` to use `esc_attr()` and also changes textarea and other input fields to use `esc_attr()` and `esc_textarea`
*   **`adminpages/discountcodes.php`**: Sanitizes values of discount code name, dates and integers.
*   **`adminpages/membershiplevels.php`**: Sanitizes level name and search.
*   **`adminpages/memberslist-csv.php`**: Sanitizes search query.
*   **`adminpages/memberslist.php`**: Sanitizes search query, sanitizes email output.
*  **`adminpages/orders-csv.php`**: Sanitizes date and search parameters.

The changes involve using `esc_attr()` to sanitize HTML attributes and `esc_textarea()` for text areas to prevent XSS. It also uses `sanitize_text_field()` and `intval()` to sanitize user inputs.
