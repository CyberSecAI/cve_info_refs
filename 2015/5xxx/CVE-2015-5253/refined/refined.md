Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Apache CXF processes SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) responses during Single Sign-On (SSO). Specifically, it's susceptible to a "wrapping attack".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SAML Response Wrapping:** The core weakness is that the Apache CXF SAML SSO module doesn't properly validate the structure of the SAML response. This allows an attacker to insert a manipulated, unsigned assertion into the response alongside the original signed assertion.

*   **Insufficient Validation:** The vulnerability occurs because the system is not robust against an attacker adding additional assertions to the SAML response before the legitimate assertion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can construct a crafted SAML response that includes a malicious assertion. This crafted response bypasses the intended authentication process.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By successfully bypassing authentication, the attacker can potentially gain access to restricted resources or information that they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The crafted response can be used to impersonate another user and potentially gain their privileges

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated SAML Response:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or manipulate a SAML response before it reaches the vulnerable application.
*   **Network Attack:** A network attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept a legitimate SAML response, modify it, and then forward the crafted response to the application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft SAML:** The attacker must have the technical skills to understand the structure of SAML and to craft a malicious assertion.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to either intercept the SAML response or send their crafted SAML response to the vulnerable endpoint directly.
*   **No prior authentication:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when the application processes the SAML response. The application extracts the subject name from the signed assertion; However, when a crafted SAML Response is provided, the application does not check the position of assertions and can be tricked into extracting the subject name from a malicious assertion instead.
*   The attacker's manipulated assertion can be placed *before* the legitimate assertion in the SAML response, causing the application to read the malicious one instead.
*   The fix involves ensuring that only the subject from the valid assertion is used for login, and invalid assertions that are not signed or are tampered with are not processed.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.1.3, 3.0.7, and 2.7.18 are affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Apache CXF versions 3.1.3, 3.0.7, and 2.7.18. Upgrading to these versions (or later) is necessary to prevent the vulnerability.
*   Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 was also vulnerable and a patch was issued to address this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report also mentions that the CXF JAX-RS module, which has this vulnerability, is not supported in JBoss EAP. This implies that while the underlying CXF library had a vulnerability, its deployment in JBoss EAP was not directly exposed.

This detailed information should provide a complete picture of the CVE-2015-5253 vulnerability.
