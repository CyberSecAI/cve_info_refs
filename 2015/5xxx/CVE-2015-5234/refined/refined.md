{
  "CVE-2015-5234": {
    "description": "IcedTea-Web before 1.5.3 and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 does not properly sanitize applet URLs, which allows remote attackers to inject applets into the .appletTrustSettings configuration file and bypass user approval to execute the applet via a crafted web page, possibly related to line breaks.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of applet URLs when storing applet trust settings. Specifically, the parsing of non-standard URI schemes is not validated, allowing for injection of arbitrary trusted applets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of input",
        "Injection vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious applets into the .appletTrustSettings file, leading to permanent authorization for these applets to execute without user consent. This allows execution of unsigned applets from arbitrary domains in the context of the victim's browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack via crafted web pages that exploit the lack of URL sanitization.",
         "The exploit is triggered even if the user cancels the authorization prompt"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and have the victim visit it via a web browser running IcedTea-Web. No user authentication is required."
