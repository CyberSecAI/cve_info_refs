Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-5175

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Apache CXF Fediz plugins, which handle responses from Identity Providers (IdPs), do not disable Document Type Declarations (DTDs) when parsing XML responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DTD Processing Enabled:** The core issue is that the XML parser used by Apache CXF Fediz doesn't disable DTD processing. DTDs can include external entities, which can be used to perform a denial-of-service attack.
- **XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability**: Although not explicitly mentioned as XXE, the description refers to the processing of external entities through DTDs which is the base of an XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft malicious XML responses with external entities that, when parsed, can cause the system to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Response:** The attacker sends a crafted XML response to the vulnerable application's plugin using the WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.
- **Exploiting External Entities:** The malicious XML response contains DTDs that define external entities referencing large files or infinite loops which lead to resource exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Interact with Relying Party:** An attacker must be able to send responses to the Relying Party application.
- **Knowledge of WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile:** An understanding of the protocol is needed to craft a malicious response.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.2.1 and 1.1.3.
- The fix involves disabling DTD processing when parsing XML responses by setting `setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING , true)` in the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and setting an `EntityResolver` to prevent external entity resolution.
