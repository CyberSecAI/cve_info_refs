Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5914:

**CVE-2015-5914**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Apple Ethernet Thunderbolt adapters can modify the host firmware if connected during an EFI update. This occurs because the system loads Option ROMs from Thunderbolt devices during the update process, allowing malicious code within the ROM to alter the firmware.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unsigned Option ROM Loading:** The primary vulnerability lies in the system's acceptance of unsigned option ROMs from Thunderbolt devices during EFI updates. This allows an attacker to insert malicious code into the option ROM, which will then be executed during the update.
    *   **Lack of Downgrade Protection:** Older systems could be downgraded to a vulnerable version, allowing the Thunderstrike attack to work.
    *   **No PCIe Disable:**  There isn't a way to completely disable Thunderbolt's PCIe functions, which would prevent such attacks by limiting the ability to load option ROMs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Firmware Modification:** An attacker can modify the boot ROM, which includes changing the RSA public keys. This effectively prevents normal firmware updates from being installed and can allow the attacker to maintain persistence on the system.
    *   **Bypass Security Measures:** The attack bypasses firmware passwords, disk encryption passwords, and user passwords, as the malicious code executes before these checks are performed.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can record passwords typed by the user and exfiltrate data from encrypted volumes.
    *   **Persistent Backdoor:** The malicious code can be used to install backdoors into the system before the OS starts.
    *   **Virus-like Propagation:** Infected machines can write the exploit to new Thunderbolt devices, allowing for viral propagation.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Evil Maid Attack:** An attacker with physical access to the target machine (e.g., during hotel cleaning or border crossings) can insert the malicious Thunderbolt device and perform the firmware modification.
    *   **Infected Thunderbolt Devices:** An attacker can infect Thunderbolt accessories and spread the exploit through shared devices or adapter substitution. This does not require direct physical access to the computer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Physical Access:** Initially, physical access to the target machine was required, at least for the original Thunderstrike attack.
    *   **Thunderbolt Device Manipulation:** The attacker needs the capability to write malicious code to the option ROM of a Thunderbolt device, typically a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter in the proof-of-concept.
    *   **Timing:** The attacker needs the opportunity to connect the malicious device during the EFI update or system boot.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content indicates that Apple addressed part of the vulnerability by not loading option ROMs during firmware updates in OS X 10.10.2 and later. However, this fix did not include downgrade prevention for older MacBooks and did not prevent attacks during normal boot.
*   The Thunderstrike proof-of-concept replaces the boot ROM, making it difficult to remove without using hardware programming or a firmware update signed with the attacker's private RSA key.
*   The attack uses the same vector identified by Snare in 2012, but unlike Snare's attack, Thunderstrike modifies the boot ROM instead of the boot.efi file.
*   Secure Boot, by itself, doesn't prevent Thunderstrike, as the vulnerability occurs before Secure Boot checks.
