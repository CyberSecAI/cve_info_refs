Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5885:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a cross-domain cookie issue within the CFNetwork framework. Specifically, the handling of top-level domains allowed for unintended cookie creation across domains.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue lies in how CFNetwork manages and enforces restrictions on cookie creation, particularly related to top-level domains. The lack of proper restrictions allowed for the cross-domain cookie vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position can track a user's activity by exploiting this vulnerability. This means the attacker can potentially monitor and record the websites visited and other activities related to web traffic.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector requires an attacker with a privileged network position. This typically involves being on the same network as the target, potentially through a compromised router, Wi-Fi access point, or other network infrastructure.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic, often referred to as a "man-in-the-middle" position. This allows them to observe or modify network communications and potentially create malicious cookies.

**Platforms Affected:**

The vulnerability affects the following:

*   OS X El Capitan v10.11
*   watchOS 2
*   iOS 9

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed through improved restrictions on cookie creation in CFNetwork. The patches included in OS X El Capitan v10.11, watchOS 2, and iOS 9 include fixes to prevent this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Xiaofeng Zheng of Blue Lotus Team, Tsinghua University.

In summary, CVE-2015-5885 describes a cross-domain cookie issue that allows an attacker with a privileged network position to track a user's web activity. The fix involves improved restrictions on cookie creation within the CFNetwork framework.
