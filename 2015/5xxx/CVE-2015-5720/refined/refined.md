Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect validation of temporary filenames during template creation in the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Specifically, user-controlled input (likely the temporary filename) was not properly sanitized when being rendered in the HTML output during the template creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the template creation process. This could lead to:
    -  **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and impersonating legitimate users.
    -  **Data theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data within the application.
    -  **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites for malware downloads.
    -  **Defacement:** Modifying the application's appearance or functionality.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** If an admin were to trigger the XSS, this could lead to full compromise of the MISP instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the template creation feature in MISP where temporary filenames are used.  An attacker would need to craft a malicious filename containing JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to utilize the template creation feature of MISP, or somehow trick a user who can use this feature to create a template using the crafted filename. This may require at least some level of authenticated access to the MISP application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in MISP version 2.3.90.
- The provided diff from the commit shows that the fix involved HTML encoding the filename and temp filename using the `h()` function in the PHP code in `add.ctp` and `edit.ctp` to prevent XSS when rendering the filename. Additionally, the `htmlEncode` function was also used in `ajaxification.js` for `filename` and `tmp_name`.
