{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "Missing user access control mechanisms",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Disclosure of sensitive information",
       "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Low privilege users can gain unauthorized access to sensitive Active Directory integration functionality, retrieve plain text domain credentials, configure arbitrary domains, and import users. This can lead to privileged access to the application and any integrated domains, potentially allowing remote access to the organization or escalation to domain administrator.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access via internet if SupportCenter Plus is internet-accessible.",
      "Local network access if SupportCenter Plus is not internet-accessible, but accessible by other users in the organization."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A low privilege account on the SupportCenter Plus application."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "root_cause": "Directory traversal vulnerability in file upload functionality.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Directory traversal",
        "Insecure file upload"
     ],
    "impact": "Low privilege users can upload files to arbitrary directories, leading to potential remote code execution, denial of service, or uploading malicious content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, via file upload functionality"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A low privilege account on the SupportCenter Plus application."

  "vulnerability_3": {
    "root_cause": "Unsanitized user input in various parameters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
    "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. Vulnerable parameters include `query` (admin only), `compAcct`, and `redirectTo`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Reflected XSS through manipulation of query parameters."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with access to the affected pages, with the `query` parameter requiring admin access."
