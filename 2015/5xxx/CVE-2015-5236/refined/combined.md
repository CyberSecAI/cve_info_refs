| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2015-08-24 13:39:47 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the IcedTea-Web used codebase attribute of the <applet> tag on the HTML page that hosts Java applet in the Same Origin Policy (SOP) checks.  As the specified codebase does not have to match the applet's actual origin, this allowed malicious site to bypass SOP via spoofed codebase value.  Note that for Java applets, origin used for SOP checks is the site from which applet was loaded, not the site hosting the page embedding applet:  <https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_Java>  Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c2)  jiri vanek    2015-09-21 12:46:44 UTC  ``` After several emails and various checks, it seems that theoretical solution maybe  - app can get code from both codebase and docbase  - code from codeabse can connect only to codebase  - code from docbase can connect only to docbase    What to do when code from codebase wont to connect to codebase via code from docbase? (nad vice versa).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c3)  jiri vanek    2015-09-21 17:14:43 UTC  ``` It seems that this behaviour is regression when urlpermission was adde: <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/icedtea-web/annotate/d700c395b040/netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/SecurityDesc.java#380>  In its parent  <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/icedtea-web/file/d2bebf24c3ef/netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/SecurityDesc.java>  is no mentioning of codebase[2] or docbase, but only usage of place, from where the code is going[1]  [1] <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/icedtea-web/file/d2bebf24c3ef/netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/SecurityDesc.java#l344>  [2] <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/icedtea-web/annotate/d700c395b040/netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/SecurityDesc.java#l413>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-09-22 08:28:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to jiri vanek from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c2)) >  - app can get code from both codebase and docbase  Would this also imply that app will only be able to get code from codebase or docbase and not anywhere else?

I see such connections rejected by Oracle plugin.

So the only valid allowed connections should be to the places from where the jars were downloaded.  If no jar is downloaded, then codebase. Right?  Also - the port is included.   What about this cornercases:  some.url/resource1.jar another.url/resource2.jar codebase=some.url In this case both some.url and another.url are supposed tobe allowed?  some.url/resource1.jar another.url/resource2.jar Again, both some.url and another.url are supposed tobe allowed?  another.url/resource2.jar codebase=some.url In this case only the another.url should be allowed, right?  this should be applied to both URLpermissions and socketpermissions, oook?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c7)  jiri vanek    2015-09-22 17:43:45 UTC  ``` The code in this arrea contains[1]    permissions.add(new SocketPermission(downloadHost,"connect, accept"));  This do not enforce port. Imho is bug, and fix delivered to this bug will cover it too (As imho both url and socket permissions should be set same)  The already mentioned thread is pointing to it [2]   [1] <http://icedtea.classpath.org/hg/icedtea-web/file/d2bebf24c3ef/netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/SecurityDesc.java#l345> [2] <http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/distro-pkg-dev/2014-July/028514.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2015-09-25 13:12:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to jiri vanek from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c5)) > When thew patch from #c3 was included[1] there  was some discussion about > codebase [2] but it does not seems to be what was implemented at the end. > However Andrew's question about"case F" is quote correct.

AFAICS, it allows connections to example.com:80.  That is consistent with what was noted above: code that originates from codebase is allowed to connect to codebase host.  Regarding the other examples with different ports, they seem incorrect.  I've not done all the testing yet, but what I see is that Oracle 8 now includes port number as part of the origin specification.  That's difference from Oracle 7.  If you load applet from a codebase on <http://example.com>, 7 allows it to connect back to other ports, while 8 only allows connecting back to port 80.  (In reply to jiri vanek from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c6)) > So the only valid allowed connections should be to the places from where the > jars were downloaded.  Uhm, no.  I only see Oracle allowing connections to codebase, and only for code that also originates from codebase and is not called by code from elsewhere.  > If no jar is downloaded, then codebase. Right?  Is there a way to have code that is not from any jar and is also not from codebase?  If the only way to load .class code is from codebase, than codebase is its origin.  > Also - the port is included.

Version dependent.  8 no longer allows socket connections anywhere.  That's what this ITW upstream bug is about:  <http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2472>  (In reply to jiri vanek from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c7)) > This do not enforce port.

It does not allow socket permission, as that would not allow it check if connection is to the same host name.  And without that, it can't separate different named vhosts hosted on the same server / IP.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c9)  jiri vanek    2015-09-29 12:59:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c8)) > (In reply to jiri vanek from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c5)) > > When thew patch from #c3 was included[1] there  was some discussion about > > codebase [2] but it does not seems to be what was implemented at the end. > > However Andrew's question about"case F" is quote correct.

(as you are explaining in  [**]  Assuming resource1 contains the main class of the applet and code that attempts to make connection is not called by some other code in resource2.  If main class of the applet is in resource2, and it calls some code in resource1, that attempts to establish connection to codebase, it is not allowed to do so.   > > > another.url/resource2.jar > > > codebase=some.url > > > In this case only the another.url should be allowed, right? > >  > > No, I only see Oracle plugin allow connections to codebase as noted above. >  > So resource2.jar can not make any connections, right?  Correct.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1256403#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2021-11-11 21:52:49 UTC  ``` This issue is no longer relevant as modern browsers do not support Java applets any more.   ``` |  |
