# Subversion, Serf: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201610-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Subversion and Serf,
the worst of which could lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-vcs/subversion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.4**revision > **1.8.16** |

| Package | **net-libs/serf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.7** |

### Background

Subversion is a version control system intended to eventually replace
CVS. Like CVS, it has an optional client-server architecture (where the
server can be an Apache server running mod\_svn, or an ssh program as in
CVS’s :ext: method). In addition to supporting the features found in
CVS, Subversion also provides support for moving and copying files and
directories.

The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Subversion and Serf.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, obtain
sensitive information, or cause a Denial of Service Condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-vcs/subversion-1.9.4"

```

All Serf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/serf-1.3.7"

```

 Remotely triggerable heap overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by
integer overflow in the svn:// protocol parser.
Summary:
========
Subversion servers and clients are vulnerable to a remotely triggerable
heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by an integer
overflow in the svn:// protocol parser.
This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
execute arbitrary code under the context of the targeted process.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion 1.9.0 through 1.9.2 (inclusive)
Only servers and clients using svn:// protocol are vulnerable
Subversion httpd servers and clients (any version) are not vulnerable
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.9.3
Details:
========
The svnserve svn:// protocol strings are sent as a length followed by
the string data. The protocol parsing logic contains a flaw that allows
an attacker to write memory past the end of a heap buffer with a specially
crafted request that causes an arithmetic overflow.
Since the flaw is in the parsing of the protocol, exploiting this
vulnerability against an svnserve server does not require authentication
from the remote attacker.
The parsing code with the flaw is shared by both the svnserve server and
clients using the svn://, svn+ssh:// and other tunneled svn+\*:// methods.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 9
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C
We consider this to be a high risk vulnerability. An exploit exists and
has been tested to work against this vulnerability.
The denial of service attack is reasonably easy to carry out, while
exploiting the heap overflow is more difficult, depending upon how skilled
the attacker is and upon the specifics of the platform. We do not believe
the exploit is being actively used in the wild at this time.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users of Subversion 1.9.x to upgrade to Subversion 1.9.3.
Users of Subversion 1.9.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the included
patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
No workaround is available.
