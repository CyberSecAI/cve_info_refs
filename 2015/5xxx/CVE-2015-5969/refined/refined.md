  "CVE-2015-5969": {
    "description": "The mysql-systemd-helper script in the mysql-community-server package before 5.6.28-2.17.1 in openSUSE 13.2 and before 5.6.28-13.1 in openSUSE Leap 42.1 and the mariadb package before 10.0.22-2.21.2 in openSUSE 13.2 and before 10.0.22-3.1 in SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 12.1 and openSUSE Leap 42.1 allows local users to discover database credentials by listing a process and its arguments.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `mysql-systemd-helper` script passes database credentials as command-line arguments to the `my_print_defaults` utility which is part of MySQL and MariaDB.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Exposure of sensitive information through command-line arguments.",
	"Insecure handling of credentials by passing them as command-line arguments."

      "impact": "Local users can discover database credentials (usernames and passwords) by examining process lists.",
      "attack_vector": "Local access to the system.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to list processes."

     "patch_information": {
        "patch_details": "The fix involves modifying the `mysql-systemd-helper` script to pass the full path of the configuration file instead of individual options as command line arguments. This prevents the exposure of credentials in process lists.",
