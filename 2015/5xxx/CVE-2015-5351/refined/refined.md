Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the Manager and Host Manager applications within Apache Tomcat handled session creation and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens. When an unauthenticated user accessed the root of these web applications, a valid CSRF token was included in the redirect response, effectively leaking the token and allowing an attacker to use this token for CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Token Leak:** The Manager and Host Manager applications generated and sent CSRF tokens even for unauthenticated users when redirecting to the root of the web application.
*   **Session Creation:** The vulnerability was triggered because the Manager and Host Manager applications were creating sessions and CSRF tokens unnecessarily for arbitrary new requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF Bypass:** A remote attacker could bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by using the leaked token.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By bypassing CSRF protection, an attacker could potentially perform actions they are not authorized to do on behalf of a user.
*   **Privileged Access Exploitation:** Since Manager and Host Manager applications usually have privileged access, an attacker might be able to use this vulnerability to gain higher levels of access to the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** A remote attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tomcat instance.
*  **Unauthenticated Requests:** The attacker needs to trigger a redirect by sending an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests over the network to the affected application.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker must have awareness that the target is a Manager or Host Manager application running on a vulnerable Tomcat instance.
*  **Ability to Capture Token:** The attacker needs the capability to capture the CSRF token leaked during the redirect.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Manager and Host Manager applications of Apache Tomcat versions 7.x before 7.0.68, 8.x before 8.0.31, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M2.
*   The fix involves avoiding unnecessary session creation and preventing CSRF token leaks in the manager applications.
*   The vulnerability was identified by the Tomcat security team.
*  The attack is performed by making an initial unauthenticated request to the root of the Manager or Host Manager applications, which includes a CSRF token in the redirect response.
*  This vulnerability is rated as moderate or important depending on the security source, usually because exploitation requires initial access to privileged pages (Manager and Host Manager applications are typically internal facing).

The provided documents also indicate that this vulnerability has been addressed in various SUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu and Debian security updates by upgrading Tomcat to a non-vulnerable version, or by backporting specific fixes.
