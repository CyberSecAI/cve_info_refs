| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1251621#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-08-07 23:54:44 UTC  ``` Steve Grubb of Red Hat reports:  When auditing the filesystem the names of files are logged. These filenames  can contain escape sequences, when viewed using the ausearch programs "-i"  option for example this can result in the escape sequences being processed  unsafely by the terminal program being used to view the data.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1251621#c1)  Steve Grubb    2015-08-10 23:39:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1061284](attachment.cgi?id=1061284&action=diff "Patch fixing unescaped control characters") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1061284&action=edit "Patch fixing unescaped control characters") Patch fixing unescaped control characters  This patch will be applied upstream. Please share with other distributions. The older the audit package, the more likely they will have problems back porting.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1251621#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-08-13 20:58:44 UTC  ``` This has been corrected upstream with the following commit:  <https://fedorahosted.org/audit/changeset/1122>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1251621#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-08-26 14:35:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by Steve Grubb of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1251621#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:04:00 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Subject: Audit: log terminal emulator escape sequences handling CVE-2015-5186

Steve Grubb of Red Hat reports:

When auditing the filesystem the names of files are logged. These filenames
can contain escape sequences, when viewed using the ausearch programs "-i"
option for example this can result in the escape sequences being processed
unsafely by the terminal program being used to view the data.

This has been corrected upstream with the following commit:
<https://fedorahosted.org/audit/changeset/1122>

Easy workaround: don't use really old terminals/rxvt/etc that are
vulnerable to escape sequence handling issues.
