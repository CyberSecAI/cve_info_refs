Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the audit subsystem logs file names. These logged file names, when viewed using the `ausearch` program with the `-i` option, can contain terminal emulator escape sequences that are processed unsafely by the terminal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unescaped Terminal Emulator Escape Sequences:** The core issue is that file names containing escape sequences are logged without proper sanitization or escaping. When these logs are later viewed with `ausearch -i`, the terminal interprets these sequences, potentially leading to unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unsafe Terminal Interpretation:** A user viewing the audit logs with `ausearch -i` might have the terminal process unintended escape sequences, which could lead to various issues depending on the terminal's capabilities. This could include:
  -  Arbitrary text display or manipulation
  -  Potential execution of commands
  -  Other unexpected behaviors of the terminal.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Filenames:** An attacker can create files with crafted names that include malicious terminal escape sequences.
- **Viewing Audit Logs:** A user would need to view the audit log using the `ausearch` command with the `-i` option for the terminal to interpret the escape sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files on the system with specific names containing malicious escape sequences.
- **Knowledge of Audit Logging:** The attacker needs knowledge about the system's audit configuration and logging behavior.

**Additional Information:**

- A patch was created to fix this issue by properly escaping the control characters in the filenames before logging.
- The issue was fixed upstream with commit: `<https://fedorahosted.org/audit/changeset/1122>`.
-  A workaround is to avoid using very old or vulnerable terminals that are prone to escape sequence handling problems.
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates that the bug is closed and will not be fixed in the specified product due to the nature of the fix and product lifecycle constraints.
