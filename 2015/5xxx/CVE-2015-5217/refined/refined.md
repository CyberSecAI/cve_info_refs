Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Ipsilon Identity Provider (IdP) did not properly authorize changes to the name of a service provider. The permission check for owner was checking the wrong field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** Non-admin users could modify a service provider's name without proper authorization.
- **Incorrect Permission Check:** The permission check was implemented incorrectly, failing to verify if the user was authorized to make the change. This allowed any authenticated user to change the SP owner, which allows anyone to change the SP name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By changing the name of a provider to a duplicate value, non-admin users could potentially cause a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would require network access to the Ipsilon IdP to exploit the vulnerability, and a valid account.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have a valid, non-administrative user account on the Ipsilon system.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to change the name of the provider.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the permission check.
- Versions 0.1.0 to 1.0.0 of Ipsilon are affected, and the fix is included in versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Patrick Uiterwijk of Red Hat.
