Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the OpenStack Image service (Glance) when images are deleted during the upload process. Specifically, if a user's authentication token expires while an image is being uploaded and then deleted, the image data may not be properly removed from the backend storage, leading to untracked data accumulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:**  The vulnerability arises from the timing between token expiration, image deletion, and the backend's attempt to update the image status.
- **Inadequate Cleanup:**  When a token expires during upload, Glance fails to properly clean up the partially uploaded image data in the backend.
- **Quota Bypass:**  The accumulated untracked data doesn't count towards storage quotas, allowing a malicious actor to exceed their allocated space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly exploit this vulnerability to exhaust storage resources, leading to a denial of service by filling up the backend storage with untracked data.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The accumulation of untracked image data can consume significant storage space, potentially impacting other services.
- **Storage Overrun:**  The primary impact is a storage overrun where a user can exceed their allocated storage quota.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Image Upload and Deletion:**  The attacker initiates an image upload and then deletes the image while the upload is still in progress and their authentication token is close to expiration.
- **Token Manipulation:** The attacker needs to time the image deletion with token expiration. This can be done by waiting until the token is close to expiry before initiating the image upload and deletion, or by generating a lot of tokens in advance and using them just before expiry

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user within the OpenStack environment to be able to upload and delete images.
- **Timing Control:** The attacker needs some level of control over the timing of image uploads and deletions, as well as knowledge of token lifetimes.
- **Glance API Access:** Access to the Glance API (v1 or v2 with registry db_api enabled) is necessary for initiating upload and delete operations.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both the v1 and v2 APIs of Glance, although the v2 API is only vulnerable when the registry db_api is enabled.
- The vulnerability is a follow up to a previous issue (OSSA-2015-003), where it was discovered that the original fix was incomplete
- The vulnerability was reported by Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin of Mirantis.
- The fix involves ensuring proper cleanup of image chunks even when authentication tokens have expired.
- Patches were released for Juno, Kilo, and Liberty releases of OpenStack Glance.
