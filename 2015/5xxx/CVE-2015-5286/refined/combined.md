## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1897)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service where a
tenant could manipulate the status of their images by submitting an
HTTP PUT request together with an 'x-image-meta-status' header. A
malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images,
bypass storage quotas, and in some cases replace image contents (where
they have owner access). Setups using the Image service's v1 API could
allow the illegal modification of image status. Additionally, setups
which also use the v2 API could allow a subsequent re-upload of image
contents. (CVE-2015-5251)

A race-condition flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service.
When images in the upload state were deleted using a token close to
expiration, untracked image data could accumulate in the back end.
Because untracked data does not count towards the storage quota, an
attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service through
resource exhaustion. (CVE-2015-5286)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-5251, and Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin of
Mirantis as the original reporters of CVE-2015-5286.

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, running Image service services will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

### Bug Description

About a year ago it was a vulnerability called 'Glance user storage quota bypass': <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2015-003.html>, where any user could overcome the quota and clog up the storage.

The fix was proposed in master and all other stable branches, but it turned out, that it doesn't completely remove the issue and any user still can exceed the quota.

It happens in case if user token is expired during file upload and when glance tries to update image status from 'saving' to 'active'. Then glance gets Unauthenticated exception from registry server and fails with 500 error. On the other side garbage file is left in storage.

Steps to reproduce mostly coincide with the related from the previous bug, but in general it is:

1. Set some value (like 1Gb) to user\_storage\_quota in glance-api.conf and restart the server.

2. Make sure that your token will expire soon, when you'll be able to create an image instance in DB and begin the upload, but the token will expire during it.

3. Create an image, begin the upload and quickly remove the image with 'glance image-delete'.

4. After the upload check that image is not in the list, i.e. it's deleted, and file is still located in the store.

5. Perform steps 2-4 several times to make sure that user quota is exceeded.

Related script (test\_images.py from here [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1398830](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1398830)) works fine, too, but it's better to reduce token life time in keystone config to 1 or 2 minutes, just for not to wait for one hour.

Glance api v2 is affected as well, but only if registry db\_api is enabled.

It seems like this could use an OSSA. However token lifetime is not user-controllable afaik... can the user tries more than 1 attempt per token expiration ?

Also the impact is different from OSSA-2015-003 if the left-over images are still located in the store.

Here is the proposed impact description.

Title: Glance storage overrun

Reporter: Mike Fedosin (Mirantis)

Products: Glance

Affects: versions through 2014.2.3 and 2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1

Description:

Mike Fedosin from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db\_api enabled are affected.

Hi again Tristan :)

Token lifetime is not user-controllable, indeed. But user can avoid it by waiting a decent amount of time.

Example:

Let's assume that token lifetime is set for one hour, which is default for Keystone, and user quota is 5,5Gb. To exceed the quota user gets the token (with 'keystone token-get') and waits for 55 minutes, after that he consecutively creates and deletes 5Gb images each 3 seconds. After 5 minutes his token expires, but uploading of all images continues. And when server wants to update theirs status from 'saving' to 'active' it fails with 500 error and clogs the storage.

Also please add Alexei Galkin as reporter, too - because it's he, who originally found this bug. He works in Mirantis as well.

It seems like this is a much, much slower potential denial of service than that described in [bug 1398830](/bugs/1398830) (for OSSA 2015-003).

Well the user can also generate a lot of tokens in advance too. But I agree the impact is rather moderate here, and considering the release schedule constrain, I would suggest to threat this bug without embargo.

Technically the impact is the same, because user can do exactly the same things, but a little bit trickier.

But yeah, I can't deny that here security risk is smaller. I consider this patch as an amendment to the previous one, which fully eliminates the possibility of quota bypass.

By the way, this patch also fixes the consequences of the old famous bug with token expiration.

Jeremy, I'd like to keep the proposed impact description, the title seems correct to me since the left-over image remain in the backend. This is actually worst than [bug 1398830](/bugs/1398830) (for OSSA 2015-003) where left-over image are actually deleted after the upload finished iiuc.

Here is an update impact description to include the additional reporter and new affected version line:

Title: Glance storage overrun

Reporter: Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin (Mirantis)

Products: Glance

Affects: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1

Description:

Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db\_api enabled are affected.

The patch looks good to me.

A couple of minor comments though.

1. Logging a warn message in v2 is probably not required. A debug log message just like the one you have for v1 should suffice in my opinion

2. The log message says it's an 'Authorization problem'. It's authentication really.

Anyway, if there isn't enough time to address the above minor issues, that's fine.

Will the fix work for the multi-tenant swift store? In that case can we delete image data when we don't have a token?

Hi, sorry for late response...

About Hemanth's second comment: but anyway we have to raise Unauthorized exception, as it was done in the other cases, for example here <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/api/v2/images.py#L90>

Also it seems that it's more authZ problem rather than AuthN, because authenticated user can't be authorized with expired token.

@Stuart, unfortunately no... To delete files form Multitenant store valid user's token is required. It can't be fixed without trusts. But it's turned off by default and considered as experimental realization, am I right?

Adding some context from IRC conversations I had recently on this bug,

the latest proposed fixes do not include the tasks related fix. So, the in flight review atm -- <https://review.openstack.org/#/q/I17a66eca55bfb83107046910e69c4da01415deec,n,z> , do not include the fix from [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1498163/comments/13](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1498163/comments/13) for getting rid if this vulnerability via tasks.

This is definitely out of some confusion so, I think we need to send another patch for tasks to avoid more of the same.

Cleanup chunks for deleted image if token expired

In patch I47229b366c25367ec1bd48aec684e0880f3dfe60 it was

    introduced the logic that if image was deleted during file

    upload when we want to update image status from 'saving'

    to 'active' it's expected to get Duplicate error and delete

    stale chunks after that. But if user's token is expired

    there will be Unathorized exception and chunks will stay

    in store and clog it.

    And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image

    which was deleted from saving status, by correctly handle

    auth exceptions from registry server.

Catch NotAuthenticated exception in import task

If glance uses registry as data\_api then it's possible

    that token may expire during image import task and Glance

    will have NotUauthenticated exception.

This code adds a correct handling of this exception and

    allows Glance to remove stale chunks from store.

Add 'deactivated' status to image schema.

New 'deactivated' status was introduced in Kilo release,

    but it doesn't listed in available image statuses in the schema.

It leads to issues on the client side, when it can't validate

    the image with this status against the schema and returns the error.

Cleanup chunks for deleted image if token expired

In patch I47229b366c25367ec1bd48aec684e0880f3dfe60 it was

    introduced the logic that if image was deleted during file

    upload when we want to update image status from 'saving'

    to 'active' it's expected to get Duplicate error and delete

    stale chunks after that. But if user's token is expired

    there will be Unathorized exception and chunks will stay

    in store and clog it.

    And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image

    which was deleted from saving status, by correctly handle

    auth exceptions from registry server.

Download forbidden when get\_image\_location is set.

When using v2 an attempt to download an image would return a 403 if the

    get\_image\_location policy was set.

Note: We had been returning both 404 and 204 when no data was

    available. There was no way to detect the 404 case without trying to

    access the image locations so I've standardized on 204.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-30 09:10:08 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in openstack-glance allowing malicous user to cause DoS was reported. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db_api enabled are affected.  Affects: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-30 09:12:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1078568](attachment.cgi?id=1078568&action=diff "Master patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1078568&action=edit "Master patch") Master patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c2)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-30 09:12:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1078569](attachment.cgi?id=1078569&action=diff "Stable/juno patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1078569&action=edit "Stable/juno patch") Stable/juno patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c3)  Adam Mariš    2015-09-30 09:13:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1078570](attachment.cgi?id=1078570&action=diff "Stable/kilo patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1078570&action=edit "Stable/kilo patch") Stable/kilo patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c6)  Tristan Cacqueray    2015-10-01 17:23:54 UTC  ``` Not that it's now public upstream and proposed patch missed a fix for import task API V2: <https://review.openstack.org/#/q/Ia6e1fe0d27b13b920ee7e728feb5305dec77e066,n,z>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c7)  Tristan Cacqueray    2015-10-01 17:24:18 UTC  ``` s/Not/Note/   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-02 07:28:25 UTC  ``` Public via:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1498163](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1498163)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-02 07:31:09 UTC  ```  Created openstack-glance tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1268208](show_bug.cgi?id=1268208)] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1268209](show_bug.cgi?id=1268209 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-5286 openstack-glance: Storage overrun by deleting images [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1267516#c10)  Tristan Cacqueray    2015-10-02 13:38:30 UTC  ``` Martin, attachments were correct, it just that this need an extra set of patch to fully address this CVE.

| **[Implement trust support for Glance images.](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bspec/trust-authentication "trust-authentication")** for **Glance**  If image upload takes a long time(usually more than 1 hour) and token expires then image upload is failing. The best case to prevent from this situation is implement trust support in Glance. It allows to request the new token if the previous token has been expired. | |

# OSSA-2015-020: Glance storage overrun

# OSSA-2015-020: Glance storage overrun[Â¶](#ossa-2015-020-glance-storage-overrun "Link to this heading")

Date:

October 01, 2015

CVE:

CVE-2015-5286

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Glance: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db\_api enabled are affected.

  (kilo) releases.
