Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Moodle Choice module did not properly enforce the closing date, allowing users to bypass the intended restrictions. Specifically, it failed to prevent users from submitting or deleting responses after the closing date.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access control: The application did not properly validate if the choice activity was closed before allowing users to submit or delete responses.
- URL Manipulation: Users could manipulate the URL to perform actions, such as submitting or deleting choices, even after the closing date, indicating a lack of server-side validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized modifications: Users could submit new responses or delete existing ones after the choice was supposed to be closed. This could lead to skewed results, inaccurate data, and potentially unfair outcomes in scenarios using the choice activity for surveys or quizzes.
- Bypass of intended restrictions: The vulnerability allowed users to bypass the module's intended closing date functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct manipulation of the URL to submit or delete responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the course and the choice activity.
- Basic knowledge of how to manipulate URL parameters.
