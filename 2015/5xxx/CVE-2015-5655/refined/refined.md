Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Party Track SDK for iOS fails to properly verify server certificates during encrypted HTTPS communication. This means that the SDK does not validate the authenticity of the server it's communicating with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper server certificate validation.
- The vulnerability affects not only the SDK's communications but also communications made by the application using `NSURLConnection`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept the communication between the application and the server.
- **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the encrypted communication, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Data alteration:** The attacker can alter the communication, potentially modifying the data being transmitted between the application and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server (Man-in-the-Middle position).
- No authentication is required by the attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Party Track SDK for iOS versions prior to 1.6.6.
- The vulnerability was reported by ma.la of LINE Corporation.
- The issue was fixed by the vendor by releasing an updated SDK.
