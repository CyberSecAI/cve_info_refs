CVE-2015-5589:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A segmentation fault occurs in the `Phar::convertToData` function when processing an invalid phar file. The vulnerability is caused by the `php_stream_free` function attempting to access a stream which is NULL.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of invalid phar files, leading to a null pointer dereference.
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service due to a segmentation fault, causing the PHP process to crash.
  - Attack vectors: By providing a specially crafted, invalid phar file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious phar file to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `Phar::convertToData` function.

CVE-2015-5590:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `phar_fix_filepath` function due to an unchecked length when copying data to a stack buffer.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow, where the length of the copied data is not checked against the size of the buffer.
  - Impact of exploitation: Stack smashing, potentially leading to a crash or possibly arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack vectors: By crafting a phar file with a filename that triggers the overflow in the `phar_fix_filepath` function.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted phar file to the system processing it.
