Subject: CVE-2015-5185 sblim-sfcb: lookupProviders() null pointer dereference

So the reporter specifically asked us to handle disclosure just now, so
here you go:

Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 reports:

The function lookupProviders() in sblim-sfcb of version 1.3.4 and 1.3.18
exists a null dereference vulnerability , a remote attacher can cause a
denial of servise (sblim-sfcb crash) via a crafted packet without
"className" info.

Let`s see how this issue happened,the code below is from
./sblim-sfcb-1.3.18/providerMgr.c :

static UtilList *lookupProviders(long type, char *className, char
*nameSpace,
CMPIStatus *st)
{
UtilList *lst;
UtilHashTable **ht=provHt(type,1);
char *id;
int rc;

_SFCB_ENTER(TRACE_PROVIDERMGR, "lookupProviders");

//here, className should be checked
id=(char*)malloc(strlen(nameSpace)+strlen(className)+8);
strcpy(id,nameSpace);
strcat(id,"|");

...

}
