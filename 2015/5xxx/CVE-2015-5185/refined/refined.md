Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `lookupProviders()` function in `providerMgr.c` of `sblim-sfcb`. Specifically, the code allocates memory for an identifier (`id`) based on the lengths of `nameSpace` and `className` without checking if `className` is a valid pointer. If the `className` is NULL,  `strlen(className)` will lead to a null pointer dereference.

```c
static UtilList *lookupProviders(long type, char *className, char *nameSpace, CMPIStatus *st) {
  UtilList *lst;
  UtilHashTable **ht=provHt(type,1);
  char *id;
  int rc;

  _SFCB_ENTER(TRACE_PROVIDERMGR, "lookupProviders");

  //here, className should be checked
  id=(char*)malloc(strlen(nameSpace)+strlen(className)+8); // Vulnerable line, className can be NULL
  strcpy(id,nameSpace);
  strcat(id,"|");
  ...
}
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. When a crafted packet lacking "className" information is received by `lookupProviders()`, `className` becomes NULL and the `strlen(className)` causes the program to crash.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate `className` before using it in `strlen()`. This lack of input validation is what leads to the null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the `sblim-sfcb` service, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet without the "className" information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring prior authentication.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The core of the issue is that the `lookupProviders` function in sblim-sfcb does not validate the `className` argument before passing it to `strlen`. This can lead to a null pointer dereference and a crash of the service if the argument is null. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet over the network without the "className" information. This leads to a denial of service.

This issue affects multiple versions of sblim-sfcb across different SUSE and Fedora distributions. Patches have been released to address this vulnerability.
