- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM OpenPages GRC Platform API is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A blind SQL injection vulnerability is present in the OpenPages GRC Platform API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could send specially crafted SQL statements, which could allow the attacker to view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send specially crafted SQL statements via the OpenPages GRC Platform API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable API endpoint, suggesting a network accessible position with knowledge of the API. The CVSS vector indicates that low privileges are required (`PR:L`).
