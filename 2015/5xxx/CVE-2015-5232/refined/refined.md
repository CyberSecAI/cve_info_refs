{
  "cveId": "CVE-2015-5232",
  "description": "It was discovered that opa-fm opa-ff contain various /tmp races in installed shell scripts and application programs.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The identified vulnerability stems from the use of predictable temporary file names in shell scripts and application programs within opa-fm and opa-ff. Specifically, these programs create temporary files in the /tmp directory using insecure methods, making them vulnerable to race conditions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure use of temporary files",
        "Predictable file names",
         "Race conditions"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to potentially overwrite or manipulate files, leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.",
      "attackVectors": [
         "Local access to the system"
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed and the ability to create files within the /tmp directory.",
      "details": "The vulnerability is present in multiple shell scripts within the opa-fm and opa-ff packages. The scripts use insecure methods to generate temporary file names, such as directly using /tmp/filename$$ or mktemp /tmp/filename$$ instead of using mktemp without a specified directory, leading to predictable file names that can be exploited."
    }
  ],
    "fixes": [
        "The identified vulnerability was fixed by modifying shell scripts and application programs within opa-fm and opa-ff to use mktemp correctly and generate unpredictable temporary file names.  The scripts were modified to use `mktemp` which creates unique temporary files, thus avoiding the race condition."
