Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of token or referrer checks in the JBoss A-MQ's Jolokia API. This omission allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability. The Jolokia API does not implement adequate protection against forged requests. This allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user's browser into making unwanted requests to the A-MQ server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker exploiting this CSRF vulnerability can execute arbitrary application code within the context of an authenticated user. This means the attacker can perform actions with the same level of access and permissions as the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that is triggered by a victim's browser when they visit a website controlled by the attacker. The victim needs to be authenticated to the vulnerable JBoss A-MQ console for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of vulnerable API:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable Jolokia API endpoint within JBoss A-MQ.
- **Ability to craft a malicious request:** The attacker needs to create a malicious form submission or HTTP request targeting the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user authenticated to JBoss A-MQ into loading the crafted malicious request in their browser. This could be done by embedding the request in a malicious web page or through other methods of social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in JBoss A-MQ.
- The issue was reported by Naftali Rosenbaum of Comsec Consulting.
- The bug report indicates that the status is "CLOSED WONTFIX", suggesting that a fix may not be provided or is not applicable in the specific context.
