# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2015-009: Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Helmut Hummel

It has been discovered, that TYPO3 is susceptible to Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

**Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS

**Release Date:** September 8, 2015

## Vulnerable subcomponent: Backend

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting

**Affected Versions:** Versions 6.2.0 to 6.2.14, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C))

**CVE:**CVE-2015-5956

**Problem Description:** It has been discovered, that it is possible to forge a link to a backend module, which contains a JavaScript payload. This JavaScript is executed, if an authenticated editor with access to the module follows the link and after that, is tricked to click on a certain HTML target. Because TYPO3 versions 7.4.0 and above include a secret token unknown to an attacker in every URL, an exploit would not be feasible for these versions.

**Solution:** Update to TYPO3 versions 6.2.15 or 7.4.0 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Thanks to Julien Ahrens (secunet Security Networks AG) who discovered and reported the issue.

**General Advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Opens external link in new window"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

**General Note:** All security related code changes are tagged so that you can easily look them up on our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

secunet Security Networks AG Security Advisory

Advisory: Typo3 Core sanitizeLocalUrl() Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

1. DETAILS
----------
Product:         Typo3 CMS
Vendor URL:      typo3.org
Type:            Cross-site Scripting[CWE-79]
Date found:      2015-07-30
Date published:  2015-09-14
CVSSv2 Score:    3,5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
CVE:             CVE-2015-5956

2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
--------------------
Typo3 6.2.14 and below
Typo3 4.5.40 and below
and other older versions may be affected too.

3. INTRODUCTION
---------------
"With more than 500,000 installations TYPO3 CMS is the most widely used
Enterprise Content Management System, providing the basis for websites,
intranets and web & mobile applications worldwide."

(from the vendor's homepage)

4. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
------------------------
The Typo3 version branches 6.x and 4.x are vulnerable to an authenticated,
non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when user-supplied input
is processed by the sanitizeLocalUrl() function. While there is already a
XSS filter in place, it is possible to mitigate it by using a data URI with
a base64 encoded payload.

The payload is slightly different through the vulnerable branches, 6.x needs
a space in the data URI payload, while 4.x doesn't. In the following proof
of concepts, the javascript <script>alert('XSS')</script> is used as a
base64 encoded data URI in the "returnUrl" and "redirect_url" parameters,
which can be found throughout Typo3.

4.x Branch Proof-of-Concept:
The following request forges the "back" link in the Typo3 "Show record
history" backend module:
<https://example.com/typo3/show_rechis.php?returnUrl=data:text/html;base64,PH>
NjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4=

6.x Branch Proof-of-Concept:
Typo3 uses the payload from the "redirect_url" parameter in the HTTP
Location header and therefore "redirects" the victim to the payload after
logging in:
<https://example.com/typo3/index.php?redirect_url=data:text/html;base64,%20PH>
NjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4=

7.x Branch:
The 7.x branch is basically vulnerable too, but the attacker additionally
needs to know a secret token (moduleToken), which is included in every
request in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability, which makes
exploitation unfeasible.

The following request forges the "back" link in the Typo3 "Show record
history" backend module:
<https://example.com/typo3/index.php?M=record_history&moduleToken=260ab28ad49>
73d29e0a77d2f799e79ca3028de28&element=tt_content%3A1&returnUrl=&returnUrl=da
ta:%20text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4=

5. SECURITY RISK
----------------
The vulnerability can be used to temporarily embed arbitrary script code
into the context of the Typo3 backend interface, which offers a wide range
of possible attacks such as stealing cookies or attacking the browser and
its components.

The exploit probability is different depending on the attacked parameters.
In order to exploit the "redirect_url" parameter, the victim only has to
login to the backend interface, while there is an even higher amount of user
interaction needed to exploit the "returnUrl" parameter, because the victim
needs to be logged in to the backend with appropriate access rights, follow
the prepared link and has to click on the "Back" button in the view.

6. SOLUTION
-----------
Update to TYPO3 versions 6.2.15 or 7.4.0

7. REPORT TIMELINE
------------------
2015-07-30: Vulnerability discovered
2015-08-03: CVE requested from MITRE
