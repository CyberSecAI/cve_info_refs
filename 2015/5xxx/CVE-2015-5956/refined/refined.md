Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5956:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `sanitizeLocalUrl()` function within the TYPO3 CMS core. This function processes user-supplied input and is susceptible to a bypass using a data URI with a base64 encoded JavaScript payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the backend interface of TYPO3 by crafting a malicious URL.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `sanitizeLocalUrl()` function does not adequately sanitize user-provided URLs, specifically failing to prevent data URIs from carrying malicious JavaScript.
- **Bypass of XSS Filter:** The existing XSS filter can be bypassed using data URIs with base64 encoded payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the TYPO3 backend.
- **Cookie Stealing:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal cookies from authenticated backend users.
- **Browser Attacks:** Malicious code could be used to attack the browser of the backend user, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Backend Interface Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate elements of the TYPO3 backend interface, potentially disrupting operations or causing further damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged URLs:** The attack relies on an attacker crafting a URL with the malicious payload embedded in parameters such as `returnUrl` or `redirect_url`.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to trick authenticated backend users into clicking the forged link. In the case of `returnUrl` the user has to also click the "Back" button in the interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of TYPO3 Backend:** An attacker must understand how TYPO3 backend URLs function, specifically how parameters such as `returnUrl` and `redirect_url` are used.
- **Ability to Forge URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to generate crafted URLs with malicious payloads.
- **Social Engineering Skills:**  An attacker needs to deceive a TYPO3 backend user into clicking a malicious link.
- **(For versions <7.4.0) Access to a User:** An attacker needs to target backend users of Typo3, as the vulnerability is only exploitable in the backend context, and in TYPO3 version <7.4.0 they need to already have backend user rights to be able to exploit this XSS.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **Vulnerable Versions:** TYPO3 versions 6.2.0 to 6.2.14, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0, and 4.5.40 and below are affected.
- **Specific Parameter Usage:** The vulnerability was demonstrated using the `returnUrl` parameter in the "Show record history" module and the `redirect_url` parameter during login redirects.
- **7.x Branch Mitigation:** In TYPO3 7.x branches, exploitation is made difficult (but not impossible) by the inclusion of a secret token (`moduleToken`) in each request. This was fixed in versions 7.4.0 and above, by including a secret token in every URL, so an exploit is no longer feasible.
- **Payload Variation:** The payload needs a space in the data URI for the 6.x branch, while it is not needed for 4.x.
- **Severity:**  The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- **Solution:** Update to TYPO3 versions 6.2.15 or 7.4.0.
