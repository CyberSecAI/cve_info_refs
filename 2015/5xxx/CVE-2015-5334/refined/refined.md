Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-5334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one buffer overflow in the `OBJ_obj2txt` function within LibreSSL. This function is responsible for converting an ASN.1 object identifier into a string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Off-by-One Buffer Overflow:** The `OBJ_obj2txt` function was modified to ensure null termination. However, an error in the error-handling code can cause a null terminator to be written one byte beyond the intended buffer boundary when the buffer is full. This is triggered when `buf_len` becomes zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can trigger the overflow, leading to a program crash due to the buffer overflow.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** In theory, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code, although it's described as less likely, particularly on OpenBSD x86 because the stack-based overflow tends to smash the stack canary.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted X.509 Certificate:** The vulnerability is reachable through `X509_NAME_oneline()` and `d2i_X509()`, which are invoked when decoding X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake. The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted X.509 certificate containing ASN.1 object identifiers. This occurs both client and server-side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by presenting a malicious X.509 certificate during an SSL/TLS handshake.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a result of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3508.
- The overflow occurs when the code branches to the `err` label in `OBJ_obj2txt`, specifically when the buffer `buf` is full and then attempts to write a null terminator out of bounds.
- The overflow is stack-based when triggered through `X509_NAME_oneline()`.
- The memory leak vulnerability (CVE-2015-5333) can help trigger this overflow by creating an out-of-memory condition leading to the error condition and jump to `err` label.
