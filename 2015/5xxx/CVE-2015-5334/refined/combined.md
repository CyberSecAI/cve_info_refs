We have released LibreSSL 2.3.1, which will be arriving in the
LibreSSL directory of your local OpenBSD mirror soon.
This release is the second snapshot based on the development OpenBSD 5.9
branch. It is still likely to change more compared to the 2.2.x and 2.1.x
branches. The ABI/API for the LibreSSL 2.3.x series will be declared stable
around March 2016. See http://www.libressl.org/releases.html for more details.
LibreSSL 2.3.1 has the following notable changes:
\* ASN.1 cleanups and RFC5280 compliance fixes.
\* Time representations switched from 'unsigned long' to 'time\_t'. LibreSSL
now checks if the host OS supports 64-bit time\_t.
\* Fixed a leak in SSL\_new in the error path.
\* Support always extracting the peer cipher and version with libtls.
\* Added ability to check certificate validity times with libtls,
tls\_peer\_cert\_notbefore and tls\_peer\_cert\_notafter.
\* Changed tls\_connect\_servername to use the first address that resolves with
getaddrinfo().
\* Remove broken conditional EVP\_CHECK\_DES\_KEY code (non-functional since
initial commit in 2004).
\* Fixed a memory leak and out-of-bounds access in OBJ\_obj2txt, reported
by Qualys Security.
\* Fixed an up-to 7 byte overflow in RC4 when len is not a multiple of
sizeof(RC4\_CHUNK), reported by Pascal Cuoq .
\* Reject too small bits value in BN\_generate\_prime\_ex(), so that it does
not risk becoming negative in probable\_prime\_dh\_safe(), reported by
Franck Denis.
\* Enable nc(1) builds on more platforms.
The LibreSSL project continues improvement of the codebase to reflect modern,
safe programming practices. We welcome feedback and improvements from the
broader community. Thanks to all of the contributors who helped make this
release possible.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=950707#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-16 08:23:35 UTC  ``` From <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/87>  [...] Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333) [...] In order to achieve remote code execution against the vulnerabilities that we recently discovered in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2015-7687), a memory leak is needed. Because we could not find one in OpenSMTPD itself, we started to review the malloc()s and free()s of its libraries, and eventually found a memory leak in LibreSSL's OBJ_obj2txt() function; we then realized that this function also contains a buffer overflow (an off-by-one, usually stack-based).  The vulnerable function OBJ_obj2txt() is reachable through X509_NAME_oneline() and d2i_X509(), which is called automatically to decode the X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake (both client-side, unless an anonymous mode is used, and server-side, if client authentication is requested).  These vulnerabilities affect all LibreSSL versions, including LibreSSL 2.0.0 (the first public release) and LibreSSL 2.3.0 (the latest release at the time of writing). OpenSSL is not affected.   ======================================================================== Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333) ========================================================================  OBJ_obj2txt() converts an ASN.1 object identifier (the ASN1_OBJECT a) into a null-terminated string of numerical subidentifiers separated by dots (at most buf_len bytes are written to buf).  Large subidentifiers are temporarily stored in a BIGNUM (bl) and converted by BN_bn2dec() into a printable string of decimal characters (bndec). Many such bndec strings can be malloc()ated and memory-leaked in a loop, because only the last one will be free()d, after the end of the loop:  489 int 490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name) 491 { ... 494         char *bndec = NULL; ... 516         len = a->length; ... 519         while (len > 0) { ... 570                         bndec = BN_bn2dec(bl); 571                         if (!bndec) 572                                 goto err; 573                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%s", bndec); ... 598         } ... 601         free(bndec); ... 609 }  This memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) or trigger the buffer overflow described below.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-5334 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5334)

#### Description

Off-by-one error in the OBJ\_obj2txt function in LibreSSL before 2.3.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (program crash) or possible execute arbitrary code via a crafted X.509 certificate, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. Note: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3508.

Qualys Security Advisory

LibreSSL (CVE-2015-5333 and CVE-2015-5334)

========================================================================
Contents
========================================================================

Summary
Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333)
Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334)
Acknowledgments

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

In order to achieve remote code execution against the vulnerabilities
that we recently discovered in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2015-7687), a memory leak
is needed. Because we could not find one in OpenSMTPD itself, we started
to review the malloc()s and free()s of its libraries, and eventually
found a memory leak in LibreSSL's OBJ_obj2txt() function; we then
realized that this function also contains a buffer overflow (an
off-by-one, usually stack-based).

The vulnerable function OBJ_obj2txt() is reachable through
X509_NAME_oneline() and d2i_X509(), which is called automatically to
decode the X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake (both
client-side, unless an anonymous mode is used, and server-side, if
client authentication is requested).

These vulnerabilities affect all LibreSSL versions, including LibreSSL
2.0.0 (the first public release) and LibreSSL 2.3.0 (the latest release
at the time of writing). OpenSSL is not affected.

========================================================================
Memory Leak (CVE-2015-5333)
========================================================================

OBJ_obj2txt() converts an ASN.1 object identifier (the ASN1_OBJECT a)
into a null-terminated string of numerical subidentifiers separated by
dots (at most buf_len bytes are written to buf).

Large subidentifiers are temporarily stored in a BIGNUM (bl) and
converted by BN_bn2dec() into a printable string of decimal characters
(bndec). Many such bndec strings can be malloc()ated and memory-leaked
in a loop, because only the last one will be free()d, after the end of
the loop:

489 int
490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name)
491 {
...
494         char *bndec = NULL;
...
516         len = a->length;
...
519         while (len > 0) {
...
570                         bndec = BN_bn2dec(bl);

This memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion) or trigger the buffer overflow described below.

Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334)
========================================================================

As a result of CVE-2014-3508, OBJ_obj2txt() was modified to "Ensure
that, at every state, |buf| is NUL-terminated." However, in LibreSSL,
the error-handling code at the end of the function may write this
null-terminator out-of-bounds:

489 int
490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name)
491 {
...
516         len = a->length;
517         p = a->data;
518
519         while (len > 0) {
...
522                 for (;;) {
523                         unsigned char c = *p++;
524                         len--;
525                         if ((len == 0) && (c & 0x80))
526                                 goto err;
...
528                                 if (!BN_add_word(bl, c & 0x7f))

561                         if (buf_len > 1) {
562                                 *buf++ = i + '0';

578                                 buf_len = 0;
579                         } else {
580                                 buf += i;
581                                 buf_len -= i;
582                         }
...
584                 } else {
585                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%lu", l);
586                         if (i == -1)
587                                 goto err;
588                         if (i >= buf_len) {
589                                 buf += buf_len;
590                                 buf_len = 0;
591                         } else {
592                                 buf += i;
593                                 buf_len -= i;
594                         }
...
597                 }
598         }
599
600 out:
...
603         return ret;
604
605 err:
606         ret = 0;
607         buf[0] = '\0';
608         goto out;
609 }

First, in order to trigger this off-by-one buffer overflow, buf must be
increased until it points to the first out-of-bounds character (i.e.,
until buf_len becomes zero):

- on the one hand, this is impossible with the code blocks at lines
  561-564, 579-581, and 591-593;

- on the other hand, this is very easy with the code blocks at lines
  576-578 and 588-590 (the destination buffer is usually quite small;
  for example, it is only 80 bytes long in X509_NAME_oneline()).

Second, the code must branch to the err label:

- the "goto err"s at lines 574-575 and 586-587 are unreachable, because
  snprintf() cannot possibly return -1 here;

- the "goto err" at lines 525-526 is:

  . very easy to reach in LibreSSL <= 2.0.4;

  . impossible to reach in LibreSSL >= 2.0.5, because of the "MSB must
    be clear in the last octet" sanity check that was added to
    c2i_ASN1_OBJECT():

286         /*
287          * Sanity check OID encoding:
288          * - need at least one content octet
289          * - MSB must be clear in the last octet
290          * - can't have leading 0x80 in subidentifiers, see: X.690 8.19.2
291          */
292         if (len <= 0 || len > INT_MAX || pp == NULL || (p = *pp) == NULL ||
293             p[len - 1] & 0x80) {
294                 ASN1err(ASN1_F_C2I_ASN1_OBJECT, ASN1_R_INVALID_OBJECT_ENCODING);
295                 return (NULL);
296         }

- the remaining "goto err"s are triggered by error conditions in various
  BIGNUM functions:

  . either because of a very large BIGNUM (approximately 64 megabytes,
    which is impossible in the context of an SSL handshake, where X.509
    certificates are limited to 100 kilobytes);

  . or because of an out-of-memory condition (which can be reached
    through the memory leak described above).

This off-by-one buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. However,
when triggered through X509_NAME_oneline() (and therefore d2i_X509()),
this buffer overflow is stack-based and probably not exploitable on
OpenBSD x86, where it appears to always smash the stack canary.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=950708#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-16 08:25:16 UTC  ``` From <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/87>  [...] Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334) [...]  In order to achieve remote code execution against the vulnerabilities that we recently discovered in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2015-7687), a memory leak is needed. Because we could not find one in OpenSMTPD itself, we started to review the malloc()s and free()s of its libraries, and eventually found a memory leak in LibreSSL's OBJ_obj2txt() function; we then realized that this function also contains a buffer overflow (an off-by-one, usually stack-based).  The vulnerable function OBJ_obj2txt() is reachable through X509_NAME_oneline() and d2i_X509(), which is called automatically to decode the X.509 certificates exchanged during an SSL handshake (both client-side, unless an anonymous mode is used, and server-side, if client authentication is requested).  These vulnerabilities affect all LibreSSL versions, including LibreSSL 2.0.0 (the first public release) and LibreSSL 2.3.0 (the latest release at the time of writing). OpenSSL is not affected.  [...]  ======================================================================== Buffer Overflow (CVE-2015-5334) ========================================================================  As a result of CVE-2014-3508, OBJ_obj2txt() was modified to "Ensure that, at every state, |buf| is NUL-terminated." However, in LibreSSL, the error-handling code at the end of the function may write this null-terminator out-of-bounds:  489 int 490 OBJ_obj2txt(char *buf, int buf_len, const ASN1_OBJECT *a, int no_name) 491 { ... 516         len = a->length; 517         p = a->data; 518 519         while (len > 0) { ... 522                 for (;;) { 523                         unsigned char c = *p++; 524                         len--; 525                         if ((len == 0) && (c & 0x80)) 526                                 goto err; ... 528                                 if (!BN_add_word(bl, c & 0x7f)) 529                                         goto err; ... 535                                 if (!bl && !(bl = BN_new())) 536                                         goto err; 537                                 if (!BN_set_word(bl, l)) 538                                         goto err; ... 542                                 if (!BN_lshift(bl, bl, 7)) 543                                         goto err; ... 546                 } ... 553                                         if (!BN_sub_word(bl, 80)) 554                                                 goto err; ... 561                         if (buf_len > 1) { 562                                 *buf++ = i + '0'; 563                                 *buf = '\0'; 564                                 buf_len--; 565                         } ... 569                 if (use_bn) { 570                         bndec = BN_bn2dec(bl); 571                         if (!bndec) 572                                 goto err; 573                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%s", bndec); 574                         if (i == -1) 575                                 goto err; 576                         if (i >= buf_len) { 577                                 buf += buf_len; 578                                 buf_len = 0; 579                         } else { 580                                 buf += i; 581                                 buf_len -= i; 582                         } ... 584                 } else { 585                         i = snprintf(buf, buf_len, ".%lu", l); 586                         if (i == -1) 587                                 goto err; 588                         if (i >= buf_len) { 589                                 buf += buf_len; 590                                 buf_len = 0; 591                         } else { 592                                 buf += i; 593                                 buf_len -= i; 594                         } ... 597                 } 598         } 599 600 out: ... 603         return ret; 604 605 err: 606         ret = 0; 607         buf[0] = '\0'; 608         goto out; 609 }  First, in order to trigger this off-by-one buffer overflow, buf must be increased until it points to the first out-of-bounds character (i.e., until buf_len becomes zero):  - on the one hand, this is impossible with the code blocks at lines   561-564, 579-581, and 591-593;  - on the other hand, this is very easy with the code blocks at lines   576-578 and 588-590 (the destination buffer is usually quite small;   for example, it is only 80 bytes long in X509_NAME_oneline()).  Second, the code must branch to the err label:  - the "goto err"s at lines 574-575 and 586-587 are unreachable, because   snprintf() cannot possibly return -1 here;  - the "goto err" at lines 525-526 is:    . very easy to reach in LibreSSL <= 2.0.4;    . impossible to reach in LibreSSL >= 2.0.5, because of the "MSB must     be clear in the last octet" sanity check that was added to     c2i_ASN1_OBJECT():  286         /* 287          * Sanity check OID encoding: 288          * - need at least one content octet 289          * - MSB must be clear in the last octet 290          * - can't have leading 0x80 in subidentifiers, see: X.690 8.19.2 291          */ 292         if (len <= 0 || len > INT_MAX || pp == NULL || (p = *pp) == NULL || 293             p[len - 1] & 0x80) { 294                 ASN1err(ASN1_F_C2I_ASN1_OBJECT, ASN1_R_INVALID_OBJECT_ENCODING); 295                 return (NULL); 296         }  - the remaining "goto err"s are triggered by error conditions in various   BIGNUM functions:    . either because of a very large BIGNUM (approximately 64 megabytes,     which is impossible in the context of an SSL handshake, where X.509     certificates are limited to 100 kilobytes);    . or because of an out-of-memory condition (which can be reached     through the memory leak described above).  This off-by-one buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. However, when triggered through X509_NAME_oneline() (and therefore d2i_X509()), this buffer overflow is stack-based and probably not exploitable on OpenBSD x86, where it appears to always smash the stack canary.
