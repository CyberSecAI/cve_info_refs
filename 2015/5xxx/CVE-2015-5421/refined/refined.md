Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow within the handling of Lotus .wk1 files in Hewlett-Packard KeyView IDOL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the way KeyView IDOL parses malformed data within Lotus .wk1 files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. The code execution would occur within the context of the process handling the malicious .wk1 file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. 
- User interaction is required, meaning an attacker would need to trick a user into either visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious .wk1 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious Lotus .wk1 file with malformed data that triggers the buffer overflow.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver this malicious file to the victim or trick them into accessing it via a malicious webpage.
