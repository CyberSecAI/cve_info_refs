Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5210:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `targetURI` parameter used for redirects after successful login. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, leading to a redirect to an untrusted server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unvalidated Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of input validation on the `targetURI` parameter, which dictates the redirect URL after login.
*   **Open Redirect:** The lack of validation allows for an open redirect, where the application redirects to an attacker-controlled URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Exploits:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious website, potentially mimicking the legitimate login page or other sensitive content to steal credentials or other information.
*   **User Deception:** By redirecting to untrusted servers, attackers can trick users into believing they are still interacting with the legitimate application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Login Redirect:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `targetURI` parameter. When a user logs in through this crafted URL, the server redirects them to the malicious site specified in the parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to use a manipulated URL containing a malicious targetURI parameter, e.g., through a phishing email or other social engineering techniques.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the redirect vulnerability, as it occurs after a successful login.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that redirect locations are relative URLs, preventing redirects to external domains.
*   The vulnerability was present in Ambari versions 1.7.0 to 2.1.1, and fixed in 2.1.2.
