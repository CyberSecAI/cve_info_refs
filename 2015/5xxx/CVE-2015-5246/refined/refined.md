Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The issue is not a vulnerability in Foreman itself, but rather a feature of Active Directory (AD).
*   AD temporarily allows the use of a previous password for a certain period after a password change. This is designed to prevent lockout issues if a user mistypes their new password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   There isn't a vulnerability in Foreman; it is behaving as expected when delegating authentication to Active Directory.
*   The weakness lies in Active Directory's default behavior of allowing the use of old passwords for a specific period (typically one hour by default).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker who knew a user's previous password, could use it to log in to Foreman even after the user had changed their password on Active Directory, for up to an hour.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access to Foreman and potentially further compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to have compromised or obtained a user's previous Active Directory password.
*   The attacker would then need to attempt login to the Foreman within the AD password caching window, which can be configured on the Domain Controller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to have knowledge of a valid, but now old, password of a user that is authorized to log in to Foreman.
*   They would need to attempt authentication within the window where the old password is still valid on the domain controller.
*   Access to Foreman's login interface is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Active Directory password caching mechanism can be configured using the `OldPasswordAllowedPeriod` registry value within `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA`. Setting it to `0` disables the use of previous passwords immediately.
*  The issue was initially reported against Foreman 1.9.0.
*   The problem was investigated, and confirmed to be an expected behavior of Active Directory and not a Foreman vulnerability.
*   The reported issue was rejected by Red Hat Product Security, deemed not a security vulnerability in Foreman and documentation will be updated to reflect the behavior of Active Directory.
