| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1258700#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-09-01 03:56:16 UTC  ``` larry campbell reports via the foreman bug tracker:  This was found on Foreman 1.9.0:  I came across this issue by chance. I was forced to change my Active Directory password today. After doing so, I then (mistakenly) attempted to log onto Foreman with my previous password and was able to successfully log in. The new password also worked. I tried with other browsers and even another workstation that I had never logged onto and all attempts allowed me to log on with my non-valid previous password. Perhaps something on foreman/passenger/ruby/etc is caching my credential and not re-checking?  Initial Setup: Have an Active Directory enviornment available for LDAP Authentication. Setup LDAP Authentication Source in Foreman and have a test user account created in Active Directory.  Steps to recreate: 1. Log on to Foreman with the Active Directory user. This should succeed. Log off. 2. Change your Active Directory account's password. 3. Log on to Foreman with the Active Directory user, and use the previous password. This should fail with authentication denied method, however it succeeds.  Upstream references: <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11471>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1258700#c1)  Ján Rusnačko    2015-09-01 05:14:50 UTC  ``` If I remember correctly I ran into this back in the past - this is a feature in Active Directory. It remembers the old password for some time to allow you to log back in should you mess up your new password. I think there`s some timeout, maybe 5 minutes? after which the old password won`t be usable.   If Foreman delegates authentication to Active Directory, this is how it`ll look like. However, since authentication is delegated to Active Directory this cannot be a vulnerability in Foreman.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1258700#c2)  Ján Rusnačko    2015-09-01 05:24:43 UTC  ``` Googled a bit and the timeout is 1 hour.  References: <http://serverfault.com/questions/461139/ntlm-auth-can-login-in-ad-with-both-old-and-new-passwords> <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/906305> <http://timstechnoblog.blogspot.cz/2010/02/old-password-still-valid-for-hour.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1258700#c3)  Doran Moppert    2020-02-11 00:29:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security determined that this flaw was not a security vulnerability. See the Bugzilla link for more details.   ``` |  |

### CVE-2015-5246 - previous password still allowed to log into foreman with Active Directory backend

**Description**

This was found on Foreman 1.9.0:

I came across this issue by chance. I was forced to change my Active Directory password today. After doing so, I then (mistakenly) attempted to log onto Foreman with my previous password and was able to successfully log in. The new password also worked. I tried with other browsers and even another workstation that I had never logged onto and all attempts allowed me to log on with my non-valid previous password. Perhaps something on foreman/passenger/ruby/etc is caching my credential and not re-checking?

Initial Setup:
Have an Active Directory enviornment available for LDAP Authentication. Setup LDAP Authentication Source in Foreman and have a test user account created in Active Directory.

Steps to recreate:
1. Log on to Foreman with the Active Directory user. This should succeed. Log off.
2. Change your Active Directory account's password.
3. Log on to Foreman with the Active Directory user, and use the previous password. This should fail with authentication denied method, however it succeeds.

Thanks to Daniel for passing this onto foreman-security and confirming the problem.

Just searching though, and I see lots of similar reports against other applications that suggest it's a function of Active Directory and/or the domain controller itself, e.g.

<http://serverfault.com/questions/461139/ntlm-auth-can-login-in-ad-with-both-old-and-new-passwords>
[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755473%28v=ws.10%29.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755473%28v%3Dws.10%29.aspx)
<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/906305>

Does the login still work an hour later, as that's the claimed timeout of those links?

From my tests, neither the connection to LDAP nor logging in work using the old password after the allowed period in HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\OldPasswordAllowedPeriod. (Windows registry). If I set that HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\OldPasswordAllowedPeriod to 0, the old password will be disabled right away.

Thanks Daniel. I'll tentatively close this for now and add the information to our manual and security page.

I second the observation that the old password failed when we tried it again several hours later. It would make sense this is an AD "feature" as pointed out by Daniel and Dominic, and I support the current method of making users aware through a Foreman Manual notice. Thanks everybody!

Thanks for confirming, and for the report Larry. If you come across across any potential security issue in future, please drop us an e-mail to foreman-security@googlegroups.com in case we need to embargo it first. Cheers.
