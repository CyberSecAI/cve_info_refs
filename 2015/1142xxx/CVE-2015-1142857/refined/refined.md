{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A design flaw in current Ethernet SRIOV NIC deployments allows untrusted VMs to control the throughput and latency of other VMs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of filtering of Ethernet \"pause\" frames originating from SRIOV instances."
    ],
    "impact": "An untrusted VM can completely control the bandwidth and latency of other unrelated VMs using the same SRIOV device by sending Ethernet pause frames.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending Ethernet pause frames from a malicious VM to the edge switch."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Access to an SRIOV device from an untrusted VM.",
    "additional_information": "The attack exploits the Ethernet flow control functionality. The paper proposes VANFC (Virtualization-Aware Network Flow Controller), which filters pause frames from malicious VMs without performance loss, while keeping SRIOV and Ethernet flow control hardware/software interfaces intact. Intel published a security advisory INTEL-SA-00046 on that issue and fixed drivers on kernel.org."
