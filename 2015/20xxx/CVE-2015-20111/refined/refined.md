Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-6031 and a related vulnerability found by Wladimir J. Van Der Laan, which is not directly associated with a CVE:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **CVE-2015-6031:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `miniupnpc`, triggered by a malicious UPnP server.
    *   **Wladimir's Vulnerability:** A second buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in `miniupnpc`, specifically related to string handling and buffer construction when processing UPnP commands. This is not directly associated with a CVE, but is fixed in the same pull request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CVE-2015-6031:** A classic buffer overflow, where a program writes beyond the allocated memory buffer.
    *   **Wladimir's Vulnerability:** A buffer overflow in `simpleUPnPcommand2` function due to insufficient checks when building a buffer, leading to potential overwriting of memory. Additionally, a lack of return value checking in `snprintf` calls could lead to buffer overflows, which was corrected.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **CVE-2015-6031:** Initially, it was used to remotely crash a Bitcoin Core process. However, it was determined that this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *    **Wladimir's Vulnerability:** By itself, it allowed significant data leak of potentially sensitive information. However, combined with the overflow from CVE-2015-6031 or other stack overflow, it could enable remote code execution, as demonstrated by Wladimir J. Van Der Laan.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CVE-2015-6031:** A malicious UPnP server on the local network sending crafted messages to the Bitcoin Core client.
    *   **Wladimir's Vulnerability:** Triggered by a malformed response from the UPnP server which is then processed by the vulnerable code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to impersonate a UPnP server and send malicious responses.
    * For exploitation, it required chaining the data leak vulnerability with another stack overflow, such as CVE-2015-6031.

**Summary of Fixes:**

*   **CVE-2015-6031:** Fixed in Bitcoin Core 0.11.1 by addressing the buffer overflow and disabling UPnP by default.
*   **Wladimir's Vulnerability:** Fixed by addressing the buffer overflow issue within the `simpleUPnPcommand2` function by correctly calculating the required buffer size and checking `snprintf` return value. These fixes were introduced in `miniupnpc` and later pulled into Bitcoin Core version 0.12.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `miniupnpc` library was used by Bitcoin Core for UPnP functionality.
* The vulnerabilities described are not remote in the sense that they don't originate from the internet, but from the local network.
* The data leak vulnerability discovered by Wladimir J. Van Der Laan was a critical piece in the remote code execution chain, by leaking memory and enabling the exploitation of the crash vulnerability.
* The vulnerabilities were fixed in the `miniupnpc` library and subsequently integrated into Bitcoin Core.
