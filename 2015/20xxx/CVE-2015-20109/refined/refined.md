```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `internal_fnmatch` function of the GNU C Library (glibc). Specifically, a specially crafted pattern string like `**(!()` causes the function's `end_pattern` sub-function to read past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted pattern string to a NetApp product using the vulnerable glibc implementation, possibly through user interaction or an application that uses the vulnerable function.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects glibc versions prior to 2.22. While not explicitly stated in the official CVE description, the provided documents show this to be a heap-based overflow. The vulnerability is triggered by a specific pattern, `**(!()`, that causes `end_pattern` subfunction to read beyond the allocated memory."
