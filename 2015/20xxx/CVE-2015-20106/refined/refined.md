Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-20106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the "ClickBank Affiliate Ads" WordPress plugin's settings. Specifically, the plugin fails to escape settings like "Title" and "Your ClickBank Nickname" before rendering them in the admin interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. Because the input is not sanitized and is saved to the database, the injected script will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected admin pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account takeover.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could redirect users, modify content, inject ads, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Settings:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, where an administrator or high-privilege user can enter malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin or High Privilege User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or a user with high privileges to access and modify the vulnerable plugin settings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in "ClickBank Affiliate Ads" plugin versions prior to 1.35.
- The provided proof of concept is: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` which can be placed in one of the vulnerable setting fields.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 3.4 (low), due to the requirement of high privileged user, though this is disputed in the second page where the same vulnerability is described as part of a CSRF chain that scores 8.8(High)
