**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The plugin allows downloading of XML data, containing sensitive information.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability exists because the plugin fails to verify if the user is authorized to access the export functionality, leading to unauthenticated access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The exported XML data includes details of even private and password-protected posts, with passwords stored in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including details about all posts, attachments, and user information within a WordPress site. This includes passwords to protected posts which are revealed in plain text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
