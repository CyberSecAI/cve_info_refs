- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were present in Squiz Matrix 'WYSIWYG' plugins. The root cause is likely due to insufficient input sanitization or encoding when handling user-supplied data within the WYSIWYG plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the manipulation of user-supplied data within the WYSIWYG editor plugins. An attacker would need to craft a malicious input containing JavaScript that gets reflected back to the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs the ability to insert user-controlled content into the 'WYSIWYG' plugins, which, if not handled properly, will lead to reflected XSS when viewed by other users.
