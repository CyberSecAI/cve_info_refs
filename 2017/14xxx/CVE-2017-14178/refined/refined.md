Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14178:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the `snap logs` command in `snapd` calling `journalctl` without appropriate match arguments. Specifically, when no snap services were specified, `snap logs` would inadvertently execute `journalctl` without filters, leading to the disclosure of all system logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient access control:** The `snap logs` command did not properly check the privileges of the user making the request.
- **Missing input validation:** The command failed to handle the case where no service logs were requested, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Information Disclosure:** The lack of filtering on the `journalctl` command resulted in the potential exposure of sensitive system logs to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An unprivileged, unauthenticated user could bypass systemd-journald's access restrictions by using the `snap logs` command. This would allow them to view sensitive system logs.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through the `snap logs` command, which was accessible via a REST API call on a local socket `/run/snapd.socket`. A malicious actor would send a request to the API endpoint `/v2/logs` using curl or similar tools.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `snapd` is running.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- The attacker must be able to access the local unix socket `/run/snapd.socket`.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in `snapd` version 2.27.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `snapd` versions 2.29.3 upstream and 2.29.4.2 in Ubuntu.
- The fix involved making the logs require admin privileges.
- The issue was assigned a "low" priority in terms of CVE, but was still fixed with high priority.
- The vulnerable code was introduced by commit `85331c16dd76eb14fcfe0cdcbd5603b4fcd802e4` which implemented the "snap logs" functionality, and was fixed by commits `90c1ec655e4ea318a80344f016e74e7e22eb9107` and `edb2d2591b50c8e3b5907cc8774c01d7914b8306` which restricted access to system logs.
- The CVE was assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (High) with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicating the attack vector is network based, with no user interaction or privileges required, with high confidentiality impact.
