Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `Exiv2::l2Data` function within the `types.cpp` file of the Exiv2 library. Specifically, the overflow occurs at line 398.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The vulnerability allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service or other unspecified impacts. The provided crash log clearly shows a crash due to a write operation outside of the allocated memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted TIFF image file with Exiv2.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF image to be processed by the vulnerable Exiv2 library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing of the trunk/development version of Exiv2.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) file is attached to the bug report for reproducing the issue.
- The issue is fixed in `exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6`.
- This issue is associated with Red Hat Security Advisory [RHSA-2019:2101](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2101).
- The `Exiv2::l2Data` function is responsible for handling data conversion within the Exiv2 library when processing metadata from image files.
- AddressSanitizer crash output indicates a write of size 1 at address `0x62700000d930` which is outside the allocated 12336-byte region starting at `0x62700000a900`.
