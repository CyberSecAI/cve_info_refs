The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14435.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference in the Moxa EDR-810 web server. Specifically, when processing GET requests to `/MOXA_LOG.ini`, `/MOXA_CFG.ini`, or `/MOXA_CFG2.ini` without a cookie header, the code attempts to dereference a null pointer, causing the web server to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference (CWE-476) when the cookie header is missing in requests to specific URIs.
- Improper handling of missing HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The web server crashes, making the device inaccessible and disrupting its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to specific URIs (`/MOXA_LOG.ini`, `/MOXA_CFG.ini`, or `/MOXA_CFG2.ini`) without a cookie header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted Moxa EDR-810 device.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, so the attacker can be unauthenticated.
