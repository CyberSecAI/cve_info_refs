The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14460.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist in the JSON-RPC interface of the Parity Ethereum client. The default setting for the whitelist is set to '*' which allows any domain to make requests to the JSON-RPC endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Overly permissive CORS whitelist: The JSON-RPC interface of Parity Ethereum client allows cross-origin requests from any domain due to the wildcard '*' in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Leak sensitive data including existing accounts, parity settings, and network configuration.
- Modify accounts and parity settings if certain APIs are enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A victim visits a malicious website, which contains JavaScript that sends AJAX requests to the victim's locally running Parity Ethereum client's JSON-RPC interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that the victim visits.
- The victim needs to be running the vulnerable Parity Ethereum client with the default JSON-RPC settings.
- The attacker's webpage needs to have JavaScript to send requests to the victim's localhost JSON-RPC interface.
