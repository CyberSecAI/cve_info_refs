Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `sdp_parse_fmtp_config_h264` function within `libavformat/rtpdec_h264.c`. The function mishandles empty `sprop-parameter-sets` values. Specifically, it fails to check if the value is empty before accessing the last character of the string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is that the code attempts to access `value[strlen(value) - 1]` without ensuring that the string `value` is not empty. When `value` is empty (a zero-length string), `strlen(value)` returns 0, and the code attempts to access `value[-1]`, which leads to out-of-bounds access and a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow can crash the application.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, the provided description suggests that the overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted SDP file:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) file with an empty `sprop-parameter-sets` value.
- **Remote Attackers:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SDP file that would cause the vulnerable code to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SDP file to a system processing it with the vulnerable `libav` library. This could be in the context of a media streaming application or other application using the library to handle media.
- The attacker would need to know the version of libav and be able to craft the SDP file in such a way to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Github commit fixes the vulnerability by adding a check for an empty `sprop-parameter-sets` value to prevent the out-of-bounds access.
- The Debian security advisories confirm the vulnerability and its fix in specific versions of `ffmpeg` and `libav`.
- The comment from "skater2013" suggests that some older versions might not be affected due to the code section being absent.
