Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read in the `read_1_byte()` function, which is called during the processing of DWARF debug information. Specifically, the issue occurs in `dwarf2.c` file within the `decode_line_info` function.
*   The root cause lies in an incorrect check for an overlong debug line info structure within `decode_line_info`, which allows the read past allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read. The program attempts to read a single byte from a memory address outside the bounds of a heap-allocated buffer. This occurs during the parsing of corrupted DWARF debug information.
*   **Incorrect bounds check:** The code that was meant to prevent this issue had a bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash in the `objdump` utility. This can be triggered by providing a specially crafted or corrupted binary file, specifically one containing crafted DWARF debug information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious actor crafting a binary file with malicious DWARF debug information.
*   The vulnerable `objdump` utility (or other tools utilizing the vulnerable BFD library) is triggered by a user to process the crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted binary file to a user.
*   The user must then attempt to use `objdump` (or related utilities) to process the file.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be local, as the vulnerability can be triggered by tricking a user to process the file.

**Additional Information**

* The vulnerable code is in `dwarf2.c`, specifically the function `decode_line_info`, which calls `read_1_byte()` function.
* The provided ASAN output shows a heap-buffer-overflow of 1 byte at a specific memory address, confirming the out-of-bounds read.
* The fix was to correct the test for an overlong debug line info structure in `decode_line_info`.
* The vulnerability affects binutils versions before 2.29.1-r1, and is triggered by passing a crafted input to `objdump`.
* The vulnerability is present in `binutils` version 2.29.
*  The issue was found via fuzzing.
