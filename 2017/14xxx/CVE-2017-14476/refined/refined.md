{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `MMM::Agent::Helpers::Network::add_ip()` function on Solaris systems executes a shell command with unsanitized input. Specifically, the role IP address provided by the attacker is directly included in the shell command `/usr/sbin/ifconfig $if addif $ip` without proper sanitization. This allows for command injection because the shell interprets metacharacters in the `$ip` variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the `mmm_agentd` process, which typically runs as root. This can lead to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted MMM protocol message, specifically the `SET_STATUS` message, containing a malicious role IP address can trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TCP session with the `mmm_agentd` daemon, which is typically exposed on the network without authentication by default."
