  "CVE-2017-14611": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `fetch_url_contents` function within Cockpit CMS, which uses the `fetch_url_contents` project code from GitHub. This code has an SSRF vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied URLs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to read arbitrary files, scan network ports, perform information detection, and potentially attack internal network servers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the `url` parameter in the `/assets/lib/fuc.js.php` endpoint."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious `url` parameter. They do not need any special privileges other than being able to send HTTP requests to the server. If the `curl` function is not available, the `allow_url_fopen` option in php.ini needs to be enabled, which is enabled by default."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "Cockpit CMS 0.13.0"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code attempts to check the referrer, but this is easily bypassed. It also makes use of `curl`, `file_get_contents`, and `fopen`/`stream_get_contents`, depending on the availability, making a wide array of protocols vulnerable including `http`, `https`, `file`, `dict`, `ldap`, `imap`, `pop3`, `smtp`, `telnet`, `gopher`, and `tftp`. The attacker can use the `dict` protocol to perform port scanning, or read arbitrary files using `file:///etc/passwd` or `file:///c:/windows/win.ini`."
