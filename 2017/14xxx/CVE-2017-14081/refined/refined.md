Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14081

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `modTMCSS Proxy` functionality of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise.
- The application fails to properly validate user-supplied strings when parsing parameters before using them to execute system calls.
- Specifically, when the parameter "type" is set to "WR", the lack of proper input validation allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application executes a system call with a user-controlled string without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server under the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- The attack is triggered when parsing specific parameters within the `modTMCSS Proxy` functionality.
- The parameter "type" needs to be set to "WR" for exploitation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, implying the attacker needs valid credentials to access the vulnerable functionality.
