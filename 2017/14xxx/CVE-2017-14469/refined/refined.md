The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLCs. It includes specifics related to CVE-2017-14469.

**CVE-2017-14469 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper access control in the user fault routine file. The vulnerability stems from the ability to write invalid values directly to this file using unauthenticated CIP encapsulated PCCC commands. Specifically, values 0x01 and 0x02 are considered invalid for the user fault routine.
*   **Weakness:** The PLC does not properly restrict write access to the user fault routine file. It allows unauthenticated users to write arbitrary data to it.
*  **Impact:** Setting an invalid value for the user fault routine causes a fault to be triggered when the device is moved into a run state, potentially disrupting the PLC's operation.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted packet with a write command (specifically function code 0xaa) to the PLC using CIP encapsulated PCCC commands over the network.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the PLC, but no authentication is required. The keyswitch must be in REMOTE or PROG mode.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability can not be exploited through the vendor software RSLogix.
* The provided exploit code in the report details how to trigger this fault.
