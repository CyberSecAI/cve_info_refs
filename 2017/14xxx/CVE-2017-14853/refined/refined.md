- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly restrict syntax from external input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper control of generation of code ('code injection').
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows unauthenticated users to execute specially crafted code on the target system, leading to potential compromise of integrity, and limited impact on confidentiality and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated user can send specially crafted code via network.
