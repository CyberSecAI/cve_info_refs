The content is related to CVE-2017-14968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the output buffer address (Irp->UserBuffer) is saved on the stack and later used without validation when used as an argument.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an arbitrary write vulnerability. The driver does not validate the user-supplied output buffer address before using it, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations in kernel space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary write in the kernel space, allowing for privilege escalation. This can lead to complete system compromise. The example given uses the arbitrary write to overwrite the \_SEP\_TOKEN\_PRIVILEGES structure to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted IOCTL request (0x830000c4) to the vulnerable device driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device driver. This would typically require local access to the system with some level of privileges that can open the device, or the ability to load a driver.
