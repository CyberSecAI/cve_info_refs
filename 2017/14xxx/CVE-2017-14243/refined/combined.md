* #### [How can you integrate authentication into zero-trust security?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-integrate-authentication-zero-trust-9baof)

  [1. Authentication and Authorization:
  \* In a zero-trust approach, every request for resource access is treated as if it originates from an untrusted network. Strict identity authentication is enforced throughout the network, not just at a trusted perimeter.
  \* Users and devices are continuously validated based on their identity, device health, and context. Access to applications and services is granted based on confidence in user and device identity, ensuring robust security.
  2. Mutual Authentication:
  \* Zero Trust advocates mutual authentication, checking both user and device integrity without regard to location. It combines user authentication with device health assessment.](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-integrate-authentication-zero-trust-9baof?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AarticleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7169403050795646977%2C7169403052506968064%29%2C7171918257770086402%29)

* #### [How can you remove all malware during the eradication phase of incident response?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-remove-all-malware-during-eradication-g390c)

  [1. Identify and Isolate: First, identify the affected systems and isolate them from the network to prevent further spread. Disconnect compromised devices or disable network interfaces.
  2. Malware Removal Techniques:
  \* Manual Cleanup: Manually remove malicious files, registry entries, and processes. Use reputable antivirus tools to scan and eliminate threats.
  \* Reimage or Reinstall: Consider reimaging or reinstalling the affected systems. This ensures a clean slate and removes hidden malware.
  \* Patch and Update: Apply security patches and update software to close vulnerabilities exploited by malware.
  \* Monitor and Verify: Continuously monitor for any signs of re-infection and verify the effectiveness of removal efforts.](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-remove-all-malware-during-eradication-g390c?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AarticleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7169034045991968768%2C7169034048756011008%29%2C7171916456710848512%29)

* #### [How does IPsec handle NAT traversal?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-does-ipsec-handle-nat-traversal-skills-network-security-dxvhc)

  [IPsec overcomes the challenges posed by NAT devices by using NAT Traversal (NAT-T). When IPsec packets encounter NAT devices, the source address mismatches due to encryption and encapsulation. NAT-T adds an unencrypted UDP header to encapsulate the IPsec ESP header. This allows NAT devices to modify packets without compromising authenticity or integrity. Enabling NAT-T ensures seamless IPsec communication across NAT boundaries.](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-does-ipsec-handle-nat-traversal-skills-network-security-dxvhc?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AarticleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7165757303785283584%2C7165757306234658816%29%2C7171915686301057025%29)

  SniperPhish is an advanced Web-Email spear-phishing toolkit developed in PHP to conduct professional phishing assessments. The abstract idea behind this toolkit is to simulate, combine, and centrally track all campaigns that involve email and phishing websites. SniperPhish avoids manual coding at each website and all later website customizations are not touching on the tracking codes placed on the website. The hits in the phishing website containing multiple pages are tracked sequentially with email campaigns. The advanced customization in the report generation module helps to export the selective columns in multiple output formats with no or minimal customization later.  In addition to the core campaign module, SniperPhish also supports hosting payloads, encrypt them, and converting them to FUD using methods such as reflective DLL/PE.

  #VaptWithAnmol
  Information has surfaced regarding a security vulnerability in Styra's Open Policy Agent (OPA) that has since been fixed and that, if properly exploited, would have resulted in the disclosure of New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes.
  Inadequate input validation is the root cause of the problem, which can allow unauthorised access by disclosing the Net-NTLMv2 hash of the user currently logged into the Windows device that is running the OPA application.
  The local user's NTLM hash is transmitted to the distant server throughout this operation. By using this technique, an attacker can obtain the credentials and use them to relay authentication or crack hashes offline.
  "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can relay the client's NTLM authentication details to the Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS), and request a user certificate to leverage for further authentication in the domain."

  Advanced Guide to Image Forensics for Legal Applications and Counter-Terrorism in India #PART7
  D. Object and Scene Recognition
  Detect and identify objects or scenes in an image for further forensic analysis.
  1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
  Extracts text from images, including handwritten or printed documents.
  Tools: Tesseract OCR (free), Google Vision API.
  Steps:
  Preprocess the image (binarize and crop text areas).
  Run it through OCR software to extract text.
  Validate extracted data against original content.
  Use Case: Recovering tampered license plate numbers or stolen vehicle details.
  2. Geolocation and Background Analysis
  Identifies locations or environments captured in an image.
  Tools: Pic2Map, Google Earth, Yandex Images.
  Steps:
  Analyze the image for landmarks, terrain, or weather patterns.
  Match these with databases to pinpoint locations.
  Cross-reference timestamps and metadata for confirmation.
  Use Case: Locating terrorist training camps based on leaked propaganda images.
  3. Reverse Image Search Techniques for Actionable Intelligence
  Reverse image search is a powerful forensic tool for tracing the origin, usage, and context of digital images. It helps professionals authenticate images, uncover manipulation, and generate actionable intelligence, especially in cases involving fake news, criminal investigations, and counter-terrorism. Below is a detailed guide to reverse image search techniques, tools, and practical workflows.
  A. Key Objectives of Reverse Image Search
  Trace Image Origin: Determine the first appearance of an image online or its original source.
  Verify Authenticity: Identify manipulated or misrepresented images.
  Understand Context: Analyze how and where the image has been used (e.g., social media, news websites).
  Generate Intelligence: Find related content, uncover networks, or link suspicious activities.
  B. Tools and Resources for Reverse Image Search
  1. Google Reverse Image Search
  Best For: Finding websites hosting the image, identifying similar images, and tracing origins.
  How to Use:
  Go to Google Images.
  Click on the camera icon and upload the image or paste the URL.
  Review search results to identify source sites, related images, and context.
  Pro Tip: Use advanced search operators to narrow down results, such as site:.in for Indian domains or filtering by date range.

  #VaptWithAnmol
  Since July 2024, an ongoing phishing campaign has been using copyright infringement themes to mislead victims into downloading a fresh version of the Rhadamanthys information stealer.
  Check Point, a cybersecurity firm, is following the large-scale effort under the name CopyRh(ight)adamantys. The target regions are the United States, Europe, East Asia, and South America.
  The attacks are remarkable for the use of version 0.7 of the Rhadamanthys stealer, which, as reported by Recorded Future's Insikt Group early last month, uses artificial intelligence (AI) for optical character recognition (OCR).
  The Israeli company stated that the behaviour corresponds with a campaign published by Cisco Talos last week that targeted Facebook business and advertising account users in Taiwan to deliver Lumma or Rhadamanthys stealer malware.
  The attack chains are distinguished by the use of spear-phishing tactics, which involve sending email messages claiming supposed copyright breaches while impersonating well-known firms.
  The RAR archive consists of three components: a legal executable that is vulnerable to DLL side-loading, a malicious DLL carrying the stealer payload, and a decoy document.

  UPDATE: ISO 27701 Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)
  The update for ISO 27701 has finally made it to Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) status. This document specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving a privacy information management system (PIMS). This document is intended for PII controllers and PII processors holding responsibility and accountability for PII processing.
  Of note, the new version of ISO 27701 will become a separate stand-alone management system, versus an extension to ISO 27001; however, you can create an integrated management system with other existing ISO management systems.
  https://lnkd.in/gf4EVF7B
  This means that the PIMS scope (4.3) is no longer required to be aligned with the ISO 27001 scope. A privacy policy (5.2) will have to exist, and privacy roles, responsibilities and authorities (5.3) will have to be determined. Privacy-specific risk management is required (6.1). PIMS objectives will have to be identified (6.2). KPIs consistent with 9.1 will have to be formulated.
  As it applies to privacy-specific risk management, see ISO 27557:2022 Application of ISO 31000:2018 for Organizational Privacy Risk Management or consider the NIST privacy approach.
  Expect ISO 27701:2025 to be published on or after March of the coming year, and you can assume there will be a 3-year transition period for re-certification to the new version. If you need help planning for the transition, or you are looking for an Internal Auditor please contact me directly.

## iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router, UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem Authentication Bypass

Tags : [authentication bypass](https://techipick.com/tag/authentication-bypass/)[iball](https://techipick.com/tag/iball/)[UTStar](https://techipick.com/tag/utstar/)

Category : [Linux](https://techipick.com/category/linux/) [Windows](https://techipick.com/category/windows/)

Hi, I hope you have already gone through my first router exploitation writing [Exploiting Router Authentication through Web Interface (CVE-2017-6558)](https://techipick.com/exploiting-router-authentication-through-web-interface). Once again researching in router exploitation, I found similar bug in two other products iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router & UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem that allowed me to bypass admin panel authentication. Both of these products are from two different vendors, but the vulnerability is same.

I was looking to find some methods to bypass authentication of commonly using routers in my country. First I came to open iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router admin page. The admin panel is protected by password authentication. I know some routers use CGI scripts like PayPal use in their websites. I tried to access common pages in the router by appending .cgi at the end of URL. Luckily I got the page info.cgi opened without asking authentication. I got few other pages also which can be accessed in the same way.

**Steps**

1. Suppose 192.168.1.1 is the router IP, then the password reset page is http://192.168.1.1/password.html by default
2. This page is a protected page which can be bypassed by changing URL extension as http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi

In the case of UTStar, the source code of password.cgi page contains the usernames and corresponding passwords in plain text. We can use this password to login admin panel!

Some pages we can directly access:

* http://192.168.1.1/info.cgi – Status and details
* http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi – Firmware Upgrade
* http://192.168.1.1/backupsettings.cgi – perform backup settings to PC
* http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi – PPPoE settings
* http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi – Router reset
* http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi – password settings

**Products Affected**

* UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem – Firmware Version: WA3002G4-0021.01
* iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router – Firmware version: FW\_iB-LR7011A\_1.0.2

# Vulnerable Product: UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem
# Firmware version: WA3002G4-0021.01
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.utstar.com/
# Reference: https://www.techipick.com/iball-baton-adsl2-home-router-utstar-wa3002g4-adsl-broadband-modem-authentication-bypass

Vulnerability Details
======================
The CGI version of the admin page of UTStar modem does not authenticate the user and hence any protected page in the modem can be directly accessed by replacing page extension with cgi. This could also allow anyone to perform operations such as reset modem, change passwords, backup configuration without any authentication. The modem also disclose passwords of each users (Admin, Support and User) in plain text behind the page source.

How to reproduce
===================
Suppose 192.168.1.1 is the device IP and one of the admin protected page in the modem is  http://192.168.1.1/abcd.html, then the page can be directly accessed as as http://192.168.1.1/abcd.cgi

Example URLs:
* http://192.168.1.1/info.cgi – Status and details
* http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi – Firmware Upgrade
* http://192.168.1.1/backupsettings.cgi – perform backup settings to PC
* http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi – PPPoE settings
* http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi – Router reset
* http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi – password settings

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
