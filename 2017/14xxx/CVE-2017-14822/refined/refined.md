  "CVE_data": [
    {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-14822",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the xOsiz member of SIZ markers. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
      "Root cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-Bounds Read",
        "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can disclose sensitive information from vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader.",
      "Attack vector": "Remote. The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image with a malicious SIZ marker.",
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution."
