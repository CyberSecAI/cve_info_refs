Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Uncontrolled Search Path Element** vulnerability, also known as DLL hijacking. The affected applications load DLL files without verifying if the DLL is legitimate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The applications are vulnerable to loading a malicious DLL if it is placed in a location where the application searches for DLLs and the malicious DLL is named in a way that the application would load it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code at the privilege level of the application loading the malicious DLL. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system where the application is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have some level of local access to the system to place a malicious DLL where the vulnerable application can find it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low skill level to exploit:** The advisory notes the vulnerability is low skill to exploit.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the system to place a malicious DLL.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on the user to launch the vulnerable application after the malicious DLL is placed. This is represented by the User Interaction (UI) component of the CVSS vector string, which is set to "R" (Required).

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory includes a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 with the vector string `AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`. This indicates that the attack requires local access, is of a high complexity, requires low privileges, user interaction is needed, the scope is unchanged, and impacts Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, all at a high level.
*   The advisory lists multiple AutomationDirect products affected.
*   The advisory provides links to updated versions of the software that address the vulnerability.
*   The advisory recommends general security practices, like minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and secure remote access methods, as well as caution against social engineering attacks.
