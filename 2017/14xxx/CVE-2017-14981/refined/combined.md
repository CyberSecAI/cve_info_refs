## Description

[![@ddddyyy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7259098?u=bd365cb2999f0dc295ab8bbb7e41c26cf9f8b85a&v=4&size=48)](/ddddyyy)[ddddyyy](https://github.com/ddddyyy)opened [on Sep 30, 2017](https://github.com/atutor/ATutor/issues/135#issue-261830554)

Product: ATutor

Download: <https://github.com/atutor/ATutor>

Vunlerable Version: 2.2.2 and probably prior

Tested Version: 2.2.2

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in“ATutor 2.2.2”, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JS code.

The parameter "url" in the file /ATutor/mods/\_standard/rss\_feeds/edit\_feed.php is unsafe, we can bypass the XSS filter.An attacker could execute arbitrary JS code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below use the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:

the poc is : =file%3A%2F%2F%2Fetc%2Fpasswd+%3C%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dxx+onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E
