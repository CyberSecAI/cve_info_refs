The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14432.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands. Specifically, the web server of Moxa EDR-810 device does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in HTTP POST requests. This allows an attacker to inject malicious operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The web interface is vulnerable to OS command injection via the `/goform/net_Web_get_value` URI. Multiple parameters within the POST request are vulnerable:
  - `openvpnServer0_tmp`
  - `remoteNetwork0`
  - `remoteNetmask0`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. This leads to a complete compromise of the device, allowing for privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/net_Web_get_value` URI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web interface and be able to send HTTP POST requests.
