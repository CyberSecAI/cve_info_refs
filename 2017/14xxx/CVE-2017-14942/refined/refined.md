{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authentication checks when accessing the configuration backup file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication Bypass vulnerability allows unauthorized access to download the device's configuration file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download the configuration file which may contain sensitive information like credentials, network settings, etc.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a web request to a specific URL (/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg) with a specific cookie.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required as the vulnerability bypasses the authentication check.",
    "Additional Information": "The exploit uses a specific cookie `admin:language=pt` to bypass the authentication check and download the config file."
