Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `_raw()` function in the `Horde_Image` library's "im" (ImageMagick) backend passes the `$index` parameter unsanitized to the shell.
- The `$index` parameter is exposed via the `getImageAtIndex($index)` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The unsanitized `$index` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the `convert` command executed by ImageMagick.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious commands through the `$index` parameter.

**Attack vectors:**

- Third-party applications using the `Horde_Image` library that expose the `getImageAtIndex()` function with a user-controlled `$index` parameter to the web.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the `$index` parameter passed to the `getImageAtIndex()` function in a vulnerable third-party application using `Horde_Image`.
- No core Horde application exposes this parameter directly, so exploitation is mainly a risk for third-party integrations.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found during manual code review after CVE-2017-9773.
- A fix was released in version 2.5.2 of the `Horde_Image` library.
- Debian addressed this vulnerability in `php-horde-image` package version `2.3.6-1+deb9u1` as part of DSA-4276-1.
