Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way SmarterStats version 11.3.6347 processes and renders the "Referer" field from HTTP log files. Specifically, it fails to sanitize or properly encode HTML tags present in the Referer field before displaying them in the "/Data/Reports/ReferringURLsWithQueries" report.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored DOM XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is a Stored DOM XSS. Malicious HTML and JavaScript code injected into the Referer field of a web server log file is stored and then executed within a user's browser when they view the referring URLs report in SmarterStats.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the Referer field from the HTTP log files before rendering the data in the report.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application fails to encode HTML characters before rendering the data in the web page, allowing the browser to interpret the injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the Referer field, which will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected report page within SmarterStats.
- **Session Hijacking:** Through XSS, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Client-Side Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The XSS vulnerability can be leveraged to perform CSRF attacks, tricking the user's browser into making unauthorized requests to the server.
- **Open Redirection:** An attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious websites by embedding a redirect within the Referer field.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify the content of the viewed page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Referer Field Injection:** The attacker must first inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the "Referer" field of an HTTP request which gets logged by the server.
- **Log File Processing:** Once the malicious log entry is created, the user must use SmarterStats to process the log file and generate the "ReferringURLsWithQueries" report.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must interact with SmarterStats, specifically by viewing the "ReferringURLsWithQueries" report, triggering the execution of the injected malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to generate HTTP requests that are logged by the web server:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server that is being logged by the affected SmarterStats installation. This could be from a compromised machine or a malicious website.
- **Knowledge of SmarterStats functionality:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL in SmarterStats (/Data/Reports/ReferringURLsWithQueries).
- **No direct authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by any user who can access the reports within SmarterStats, with no prior authentication required to inject the malicious request.
- **Victim Interaction:** The vulnerability requires that a user views the crafted report in order to trigger the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported to SmarterTools on September 19, 2017, and a fix was released in version 11.3.6480 on September 28, 2017.
- The provided content also highlights the importance of sanitizing user inputs, utilizing CORS headers, and always assuming that inputs are hostile.
