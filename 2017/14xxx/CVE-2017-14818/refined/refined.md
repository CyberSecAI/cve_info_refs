  "CVE-2017-14818": {
    "RELATED": true,
    "SUMMARY": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of JPEG2000 images embedded in PDF files in Foxit Reader. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.",
    "ROOT_CAUSE": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JPEG2000 images embedded within PDF files. Specifically, the application does not properly check the bounds of data being read, leading to out-of-bounds reads.",
    "WEAKNESSES": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Insufficient Data Validation"
    ],
    "IMPACT": "A remote attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information. This issue, in combination with other vulnerabilities, could be leveraged to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "ATTACK_VECTORS": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious PDF files that contain embedded JPEG2000 images. The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens such a PDF file in Foxit Reader.",
    "ATTACKER_CAPABILITIES": "Attackers require the ability to create malicious PDF files and must rely on user interaction (opening the malicious file) for the vulnerability to be exploited."
