Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue in the `xsd_datasource_schema_file` parameter when modifying a data source within the OpenText Document Sciences xPression application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the filename provided in the `xsd_datasource_schema_file` parameter, allowing an attacker to use relative paths (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to prevent an authenticated user from specifying an arbitrary file path, enabling the file read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file accessible to the application's user on the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, passwords, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/xAdmin/html/cm_datasource_group_xsd.jsp` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated `xsd_datasource_schema_file` Parameter:** Within the POST request, the attacker sets the `xsd_datasource_schema_file` parameter to a path using relative traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) to target files outside of the webroot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the xPression application to access the data source modification functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit code shows how to use a POST request to modify a data source and trigger the vulnerability.
* The `etc/passwd` file is used in the example to demonstrate the ability to read system files.
* The vulnerability was tested on OpenText Document Sciences xPression v4.5SP1 Patch 13 but older versions may also be affected.
* A fix is referenced with a link to an OpenText knowledge base article.
