Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14624:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `PostscriptDelegateMessage` function within ImageMagick.
*   The code attempts to allocate memory to store messages using `AcquireQuantumMemory` or resize existing memory with `ResizeQuantumMemory`.
*   The issue arises because `AcquireQuantumMemory` can return `NULL` if memory allocation fails, and the code does not check for this condition before dereferencing the pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. If `AcquireQuantumMemory` returns `NULL`, the code proceeds to access memory at `(*messages)[length+offset]`, which is an invalid memory access, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the ImageMagick application, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for other exploitation (unspecified):** The Ubuntu notice mentions "possibly execute code", which suggests that although the primary vulnerability leads to a crash due to null pointer dereference, there might be other scenarios due to memory handling which could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution. This is not specified in detail though.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted or malformed image file, particularly postscript images as the vulnerability is in the `PostscriptDelegateMessage` function. An attacker could craft an image that triggers the memory allocation failure leading to the null pointer dereference.
*   **User or automated system:** The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses ImageMagick to process a malicious image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable system with a malicious postscript image.
*  The attacker needs to have the ability to cause the system to use ImageMagick to process the crafted image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian and Ubuntu security notices confirm that this CVE is related to a memory handling issue in ImageMagick that could lead to a denial of service.
*   The GitHub issue #722 provides code snippets and further details about the vulnerability which confirms the root cause as a missing null check for returned value from memory allocation routines.
*   The Ubuntu notice mentions that an attacker could "possibly execute code" indicating that while this particular vulnerability causes a crash due to null pointer dereference, there might be related scenarios that could be exploited for remote code execution.
