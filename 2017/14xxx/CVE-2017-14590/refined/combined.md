## Bamboo - Various vulnerabilities - CVE-2017-14589, CVE-2017-14590

Note: As of September 2014 we are no longer issuing binary bug patches, instead we create new maintenance releases for the major versions we are backporting.

| Summary | CVE-2017-14589 -  Remote code execution through OGNL double evaluation, CVE-2017-14590 - Argument injection through Mercurial repository handling |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Release Date | 12 Dec 2017 10 AM PDT (Pacific Time, -8 hours) |
| Product | Bamboo |
| Affected Bamboo Versions | * version < 6.1.6 * 6.2.0 <= version < 6.2.5 |
| Fixed Bamboo Versions | * 6.1.6 * 6.2.5 |
| CVE ID(s) | * CVE-2017-14589 * CVE-2017-14590 |

**Summary of Vulnerability**

This advisory discloses **critical severity** security vulnerabilities which affects Bamboo.**All versions of Bamboo****before 6.1.6** (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by these vulnerabilities.

**Customers who have upgraded Bamboo to version 6.1.6 **or 6.2.5**** **are** **not affected****.**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Bamboo less than 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x)**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Bamboo >= 6.2.0 less than 6.2.5 (the fixed version for **6.2.x**)**

Please **upgrade your** Bamboo installations **immediately** to fix this vulnerability.

### **Remote code execution through OGNL d**ouble evaluation **(CVE-2017-14589)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in FreeMarker templates through Struts FreeMarker tags to occur. An attacker who has restricted administration rights to Bamboo or who hosts a website that a Bamboo administrator visits, is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo.

All versions of Bamboo before 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-18842>

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit**Sebastian Perez** for reporting this issue to us.

#### **Mitigation**

This issue cannot be mitigated.

### Argument injection in Mercurial repository handling (CVE-2017-14590)

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

Bamboo did not check that the name of a branch in a Mercurial repository contained argument parameters. An attacker who has permission to do one or more of the following:

* create a repository in Bamboo
* edit an existing plan in Bamboo that has a non-linked Mercurial repository
* create or edit a plan in Bamboo when there is at least one linked Mercurial repository that the attacker has permission to use
* commit to a Mercurial repository used by a Bamboo plan which has branch detection enabled

can execute code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo Server.

Versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:  <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-18843>

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit **Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant** for reporting this issue to us.

#### **Mitigation**

Disable the "Atlassian Bamboo Mercurial Repository Plugin" via the Addons menu in the Administration section.

### **Fix**

We have taken the following steps to address these issues:

1. Released Bambooversion 6.2.5 that contains a fix for these issues and can be downloaded from [https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download "Follow link").
2. Released Bambooversion 6.1.6 that contains a fix for these issues and can be downloaded from [https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download-archives](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download-archives "Follow link").

### ****What You Need to Do****
