Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-14590:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in Bamboo's handling of Mercurial repository branch names. Specifically, the system does not check if a branch name contains argument parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Argument Injection:**  Mercurial branch names are not validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the Mercurial commands executed by Bamboo.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious arguments into a Mercurial branch name, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Bamboo server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has permission to perform one or more of the following:
    - Create a repository in Bamboo.
    - Edit an existing Bamboo plan that uses a non-linked Mercurial repository.
    - Create or edit a plan in Bamboo when there is at least one linked Mercurial repository the attacker has permission to use.
    - Commit to a Mercurial repository used by a Bamboo plan which has branch detection enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have some level of access/permissions within the Bamboo environment or to repositories connected to Bamboo in order to create/edit repository or plan configurations or commit to a repository used by a bamboo plan.

**Affected Versions:**
- Bamboo versions from 2.7.0 up to (but not including) 6.1.6
- Bamboo versions from 6.2.0 up to (but not including) 6.2.5

**Mitigation:**
- Disable the "Atlassian Bamboo Mercurial Repository Plugin" via the Addons menu in the Administration section.
- Upgrade to Bamboo version 6.1.6 or 6.2.5 (or higher).

**Additional Notes:**
- The severity is rated as "critical".
- The vulnerability is tracked as BAM-18843 in Atlassian's JIRA.
- The issue was reported by Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant.
- The issue is related to CVE-2017-14589 (BAM-18842), which is a remote code execution vulnerability via OGNL double evaluation.
