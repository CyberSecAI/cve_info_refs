The provided content discusses a bug in the game Overwatch that causes players to lose significant Skill Rating (SR) and receive a season ban. This information is relevant to understanding a potential vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The bug is triggered when a player leaves a competitive match during the loading screen, causing the match to enter a 'waiting for players' state that fails to start and loops.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core issue lies in how the game handles a disconnect during the loading phase of a competitive match, leading to an incorrect assessment and punishment of players involved in such a situation. The system incorrectly attributes the problem to the players instead of the server/game malfunction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Players experience a massive loss of SR (hundreds of points).
*   Players are immediately hit with a season ban from competitive play.
*   The system is not working as intended and gives unjustified punishments.
*   Customer service is unable to revert or provide information about the problem.
*   The issue appears to affect all players in the match

**Attack Vectors:** A player leaving during the loading screen. It's not clear if this can be intentionally triggered by a malicious player or if it's accidental.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The "attacker" in this scenario is a player that disconnects or leaves at the wrong moment. The player doesn't need to have any special access, skills or intention to trigger it.
