# There's a bug out there that can instantly season-ban you and take hundreds of SR away

[News & Discussion](/r/Overwatch/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%20%26%20Discussion%22)

**EDIT: A happy ending!**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

<https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759216554?page=8#post-142>

Bans are being reverted and SR is being restored. I'll have my fiancee try out her account later. Thanks for everyone's help here bringing visibility to the problem. According to Jeff, less than 200 accounts were affected, which is a small percent of the OW population, so I really appreciate the fact that nearly everyone who was helping me signal boost did not have the problem but just wanted to help, thank you.

Justice was done, inner Reinhardt appeased.

Original post follows:

I've been posting about it for weeks now, here's my latest bug report post: <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759216554>

Basically, it seems to happen if someone leaves right as the competitive match is loading or something. The match goes into a 'waiting for players' state, odd for competitive. The match tries to start, fails, and returns to 'waiting for players' with the same players and repeats. Folks who have seen this bug lose HUNDREDS of SR, and, most importantly, get season banned immediately, even with no prior disconnects. Seems like it affects everyone in the match, but I can't confirm.

I've found claims of several people who have hit this bug. The only real hard evidence I have are the Overbuff stats of some folks: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/grju2y5ycw7hcvp/spicy_sr_drop.png?dl=0> or this <https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1u23iib1hca9um/redandblack_ow_record.PNG?dl=0>

Those stat changes should not be possible - even if you d/c, the incremental suspensions would prevent you from losing SR that fast.

Blizzard customer support says they can't fix it and asks you to post to the bug report forums to see if a dev will fix. But I've been posting every day for 3 weeks to no avail. My fiancee and I used to play together nearly every night since launch, and now we can't play comp, and that really blows (not really interested in QP). Really sucks that they're just beginning to implement a three-strikes-perma-ban system, so she's already starting with a strike.

Consider this a PSA, you may one day queue for a match that instantly bans you, and Blizzard will not help. Also consider it a plea, that if someone at Blizzard sees this, please unban the affected accounts, this is a really severe issue...

EDIT: Woo, front page of the subreddit and reddit gold, thanks all! Great visibility to get this PSA out and increase the odds that someone at Blizzard who actually has power to unban people will see it, I really appreciate it everyone. It's a rare issue so it's easy to sweep aside, but the increased visibility gives me a tiny bit more hope that someone will actually do something about it (long term: fix the bug! short term: unban the accounts!)

EDIT2: This info is in the forum post I link to, but here are the affected folks I've found. I wanted to clarify that I wasn't affected (so you won't find anything looking at my account), but my fiancee and these others were. I'm sure there are plenty of others (like [u/Lady\_of\_Malice](/user/Lady_of_Malice/) who posted here) whose reports I haven't found.

Spicyhappy (my fiancee) lost 600SR and was season-banned: <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758678565#post-1>

Axesor lost SR and got season-banned (same match as Spicyhappy): <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758678565#post-2>

Dave5Gun lost 400SR and was season-banned (lots of other folks in the topic experienced it too in the same match, unclear if they were all banned, but someone else in the match lost 350SR): <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758848061#post-1>

wowitsasquit lost 250SR and got a 20 hour ban: <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758867927#post-1>

redandblack lost 500SR and got season-banned: <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758996245#post-1>

Slowky lost 600SR and got season-banned: <https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759286659>

EDIT3: Just an illustration of the dead end that customer service is for this type of issue, this is from spicyhappy's CS ticket (after sever back-and-forth pleas for any information or escalation): "We unfortunately have no information on how or why you were suspended, and we can't even check your rating or how much you lost at the time. I understand you want more information about why it happened, but there isn't anything we can do to escalate this or provide any information"
