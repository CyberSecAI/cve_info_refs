                 CVE-2017-14767

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FFmpeg multimedia
framework, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed Real, MV, RL2, ASF, Apple HLS,
Phantom Cine, MXF, NSV, MOV or RTP H.264 files/streams are processed.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:3.2.8-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.

Package        : libav
Version        : 6:11.12-1~deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1872 CVE-2017-14058 CVE-2017-1000460 CVE-2018-6392
                 CVE-2018-1999012
Debian Bug     :

Several security issues have been corrected in multiple demuxers and
decoders of the libav multimedia library.

CVE-2015-1872

    The ff_mjpeg_decode_sof function in libavcodec/mjpegdec.c did not
    validate the number of components in a JPEG-LS Start Of Frame
    segment, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
    impact via crafted Motion JPEG data.

CVE-2017-14058

    The read_data function in libavformat/hls.c did not restrict reload
    attempts for an insufficient list, which allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (infinite loop).

CVE-2017-1000460

    In get_last_needed_nal() (libavformat/h264.c) the return value of
    init_get_bits was ignored and get_ue_golomb(&gb) was called on an
    uninitialized get_bits context, which caused a NULL deref exception.

CVE-2018-6392

    The filter_slice function in libavfilter/vf_transpose.c allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-array access)
    via a crafted MP4 file.

CVE-2018-1999012

    libav contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in pva format
    demuxer that could result in a vulnerability that allowed attackers to
    consume excessive amount of resources like CPU and RAM. This attack
    appeared to be exploitable via specially crafted PVA file had to be
    provided as input.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
6:11.12-1~deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.
