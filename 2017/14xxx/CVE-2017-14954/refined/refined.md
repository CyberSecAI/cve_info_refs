Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `waitid()` system call implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `rusage` structure was being copied to user space even when `kernel_waitid()` did not return a valid PID, leading to an information leak. The `rusage` structure would contain kernel memory addresses which could be used to bypass KASLR. The `compat` version of `waitid()` had a similar issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of kernel memory addresses to user space. This is due to the `rusage` structure being copied to the user space regardless of the `kernel_waitid` return value
*   **Incorrect conditional check:** The code was designed to copy the rusage structure when kernel\_waitid did not return an error, rather than only when it returned a PID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **KASLR Bypass:** The leaked kernel memory addresses can be used to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), a security feature designed to randomize the memory locations of kernel components.
*   **Increased Exploitability:** By bypassing KASLR, attackers can more easily construct and execute exploits targeting other kernel vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`waitid()` System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by making a `waitid()` system call with the `rusage` parameter set, and when kernel\_waitid does not return a valid PID.
*   **`compat_waitid()` System Call:** The 32-bit compat variant of the `waitid()` system call was also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Level Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code at the user level to make the vulnerable `waitid()` system call.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `SYSCALL_DEFINE5(waitid, ...)` and `COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE5(waitid, ...)` implementations in `kernel/exit.c`.
*   The fix involves checking the return value of `kernel_waitid()` and only copying the `rusage` structure when a valid PID is returned.
*   The `rusage` structure is filled with values by kernel, and in the case where a child process does not need to be waited on, it can contain kernel addresses that should not be leaked to user space.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided code snippet (`grsecurity.net_de607465_20250125_144704.html`) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a simple C program. It calls `waitid()` on a forked process and then scans the returned `rusage` structure for leaked kernel addresses.
* The fix was committed to the Linux kernel with commit ID `6c85501f2fabcfc4fc6ed976543d252c4eaf4be9`.
* The issue was reported and tested by Alexander Potapenko.
