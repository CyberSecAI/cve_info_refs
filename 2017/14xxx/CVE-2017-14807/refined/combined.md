| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065396#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2017-10-27 07:25:30 UTC  ``` in self.paginated_search sql query is build manually from untrusted input:       sql += " LOWER(event) LIKE LOWER('#{event.downcase}')" Event is controlled by the user.   Example:  <http://192.168.122.76/admin/diary?utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=qzFRENODQHjMqJNJ&diary_from=YYYY-MM-DD&diary_to=now&event=logged_in%27)%20or%20(%271%27=%271&commit=Apply+filter>  As far as I can see the diary is only accessible to the admin. I'm not sure if in the SUSE studio context 'studio admin' == 'server admin'. If not we should fix it if we do another update for studio. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1065396#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2020-01-27 08:52:57 UTC  ``` Studio EOL ``` |  |
