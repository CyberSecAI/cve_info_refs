{
  "CVE-2017-14201": {
    "description": "The shell DNS command can cause unpredictable results due to misuse of stack variables.",
    "root_cause": "The shell DNS command handler used a stack allocated structure to pass data to the DNS callback function. When the command handler returned, the stack memory was overwritten and the callback function would crash when trying to access the data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect stack memory management",
      "Use of stack variables passed to asynchronous callbacks"
     ],
    "impact": "Unpredictable behavior and crashes due to use-after-free on stack variables.",
    "attack_vectors": "Executing a shell DNS command.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute commands via the shell interface. No special privileges required."
  }
