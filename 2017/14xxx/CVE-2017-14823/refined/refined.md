      "CNA": "Foxit",
      "ID": "CVE-2017-14823",
      "Date": "2017-11-14",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the signer method of XFA's Signature objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."

    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition within the signer method of XFA's Signature objects.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Type Confusion",
        "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution under the context of the current process.",
      "Attack vector": "The attacker must craft a malicious PDF file or lure a victim to visit a malicious web page.",
      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted PDF file or host a malicious web page. The victim must then open the malicious file or navigate to the malicious website."
