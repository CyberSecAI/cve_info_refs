| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-09-14 22:24:30 UTC  ``` This init script for flower gives ownership of its PID file directory to the daemon's runtime user:    start_pre() {       checkpath -d -m 0755 -o "${user}":"${group}" "${pidfile%/*}"   }  That can be exploited by $user to kill root processes, since when the service is stopped, root will send a SIGTERM to the contents of the PID file (which are controlled by $user).  Fortunately, the PID file is already created as root:root, so the call to checkpath above is superfluous, and the issue can be fixed by setting,    pidfile="/run/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid"  and by deleting the start_pre() function entirely.  Some unrelated suggestions:    1. Change the deprecated $SVCNAME to $RC_SVCNAME   2. Use command_user instead of --user and --group in start_stop_daemon_args.   3. One of "need net" and "after net" is redundant.   4. The ebuild runs,         fowners ${PN}:${PN} /var/log/${PN}       but the init script gives you the ability to switch users. If the      user and group are ever switched, the ownership information on      /var/log/flower will be wrong. Unless there's a good reason for it,      I would settle on user=group=flower and leave it unconfigurable. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Zac Medico   gentoo-dev  2017-09-14 23:57:40 UTC  ``` Fixed in 0.9.1-r1:  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=54fcfe2d700b35705ce973ef2dab40212854b3b3>  There are no older versions to remove. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aleksandr Wagner (Kivak)    2017-09-15 01:50:12 UTC  ``` This bug will be kept open for CVE assignment, the CVE has been requested.
