- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The init script for flower gives ownership of the PID file directory to the daemon's runtime user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Privilege escalation via PID file manipulation.
  - The init script uses `checkpath` to set ownership of the PID file directory to the daemon's runtime user, which can be exploited by that user.
  - When the service is stopped, the root process sends a SIGTERM signal to the PID listed in the PID file, which is controlled by the user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can kill root processes by manipulating the contents of the PID file.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user who has control over the daemon's runtime user can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the PID file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must have control over the user the daemon runs as.
