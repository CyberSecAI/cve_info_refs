- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation. A local attacker can provide a malicious parameter to a script that is not validated by the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to retrieve any file on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to provide the malicious parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system to execute the script with the malicious parameter.
