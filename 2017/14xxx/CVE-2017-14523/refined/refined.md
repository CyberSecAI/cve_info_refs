Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `Host` header in HTTP requests by the WonderCMS application. Specifically, the application does not validate or sanitize the host header, which is used for redirecting users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Host Header Injection. The application doesn't validate the `Host` header, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary hostnames.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application's code allows arbitrary host headers to be defined, leading to potential redirection/user URL manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary User Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites by manipulating the Host header.
- **Cache Poisoning:** The vulnerability can lead to cache poisoning attacks.
- **User Tricking:** Attackers can trick users into visiting malicious sites via manipulated URLs.
- **Potential for Password Reset Attacks**: It's mentioned that this vulnerability can also lead to severe attacks such as password reset, which is not elaborated upon in the provided resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:**  The attack vector is via manipulation of the `Host` header in HTTP requests. An attacker uses an interception proxy (like Burp Suite) to modify the Host header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be done via a proxy tool or by being in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Knowledge of HTTP:**  The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP headers and how to manipulate them.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in WonderCMS version 2.3.1
- The application is a flat file CMS built with PHP, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
- The application does not have proper filtering mechanisms for the Host header.

**Mitigation:**
The provided content suggests the application code should be configured to:
-   Not allow user redirections to arbitrary hosts from the HTTP header.
-   Use pre-defined or sanitized requests, implying a whitelist of allowed hostnames is the correct way to resolve this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Exploit-DB entry provides a concise proof-of-concept, demonstrating the redirection.
- The blog post includes screenshots of the attack using a proxy tool, and gives the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- There is also mention in the blog post about other vulnerabilities found in the same CMS, namely CVE-2017-14521 (Arbitrary file upload and RCE) and CVE-2017-14522 (Stored XSS), indicating a pattern of insecure coding practices.
