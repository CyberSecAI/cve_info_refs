privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/nagios-core** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.4** |

### Background

## Description

[![@orlitzky](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432135?v=4&size=48)](/orlitzky)[orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky)opened [on Aug 30, 2017](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/424#issue-253980599)

This is still a work-in-progress; our Nagios installation is pretty simple so I'll have to do some testing to make sure none of my proposed solutions break things.

**Problem**

When Nagios is configured, the user and group under which it will run are chosen:

```
  --with-nagios-user=<user>
                          sets user name to run nagios
  --with-nagios-group=<grp>
                          sets group name to run nagios

```

Both default to "nagios" -- the following is from `configure.ac`:

```
AC_ARG_WITH(nagios_user,AC_HELP_STRING([--with-nagios-user=<user>],[sets user name to run nagios]),nagios_user=$withval,nagios_user=nagios)
AC_ARG_WITH(nagios_group,AC_HELP_STRING([--with-nagios-group=<grp>],[sets group name to run nagios]),nagios_grp=$withval,nagios_grp=nagios)

```

Immediately after those two lines, this appears:

```
INSTALL_OPTS="-o $nagios_user -g $nagios_grp"
AC_SUBST(INSTALL_OPTS)

```

Those `INSTALL_OPTS` are then used in every invocation of the `install` command during installation.

This can lead to a root exploit in at least two ways. The fundamental problem is that the nagios daemon is intended to be launched as root, but the daemon itself and some critical configuration files are writable (in an exploitable way) by the restricted nagios user.

1. The binary for the daemon itself, i.e. `/usr/sbin/nagios` is owned by the `$nagios_user`, but will be run as root. The `$nagios_user` can overwrite that binary with whatever he wants, and root will run it.
2. The configuration file `nagios.cfg` specifies the user and group that nagios will run as, but is owned by that same `$nagios_user`. He can edit `nagios.cfg` himself, and set `nagios_user=root`, `nagios_group=root`. The command definition file `objects/commands.cfg` is also owned by `$nagios_user`, and he can place whatever commands in there he likes. Considering that the daemon will run as root the next time it is launched, this will also let the `$nagios_user` gain root eventually.

**Resolution**

At the very least, `nagios.cfg` and the executables must not be writable by anyone other than root. To ensure that the executables aren't owned by the nagios user, it suffices to set `INSTALL_OPTS=""` in `base/Makefile.in` and `cgi/Makefile.in`.

For the configuration file, I'm not so sure: is there a reason for the other configs (besides `nagios.cfg`) to be owned by the `$nagios_user` and `$nagios_grp`?
