# CVE-2017-14340: Linux kernel: xfs: unprivileged user kernel oops

```

Summary
-------

XFS mishandles a user settable inode flag in kernels prior to
4.14-rc1 which can cause a local denial of service via a kernel
oops.

Description
-----------

Richard Wareing recently discovered that if the XFS kernel code is
compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y, the code mishandles
FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT and FS_XFLAG_REALTIME flags when the filesystem
does not have a realtime device configured. When an fsync/fdatasync
operation is run on an inode configured this way, we attempt to
flush the cache of the non-existent realtime device and the kernel
will oops.

While a user cannot set the FS_XFLAG_REALTIME directly on such a
filesystem, we fail to prevent them from setting the
FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT on directories.  Hence files can inherit the
problematic FS_XFLAG_REALTIME flag from their parent directory at
create time. Setting the FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT flag does not require
special privileges, so any user with permission to write to a
directory can set it.

Details of the oops signature and the trivial reproducer can be
found in the commit message for the fix below.

Scope of vulnerable filesystems
-------------------------------

This vulnerability was introduced in late 2005 by commit
f538d4da8d52 ("[XFS] write barrier support"). Hence XFS filesystems
on all kernels since 2.6.16 are vulnerable except for:

        * Kernels that are compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n are
          not vulnerable.

        * XFS filesystems with actual realtime devices are not
          not vulnerable.

How to recognise a vulnerable system
------------------------------------

1. Search the boot log for the XFS initialisation message. If this
message contains the world "realtime" then the kernel is vulnerable
to the issue:

CONFIG_XFS_RT=y (vulnerable):

# dmesg |grep "XFS with"
[    1.625711] SGI XFS with ACLs, security attributes, realtime, debug enabled

CONFIG_XFS_RT=n (not vulnerable):

# dmesg |grep "XFS with"
[    1.625711] SGI XFS with ACLs, security attributes, debug enabled

2. If you have a vulnerable kernel, check each XFS filesystems to
see if they use a realtime device.

This filesystem is not vulnerable as it has a realtime device
configured:

# xfs_info /mnt |grep ^realtime
realtime =/dev/ram0              extsz=4096   blocks=2048000, rtextents=2048000

This filesystem is vulnerable if the kernel is vulnerable as it does
not have a realtime device:

# xfs_info /mnt |grep ^realtime
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

Mitigation
----------

Fixed upstream in 4.14-rc1, commit below.

Backports to supported stable upstream kernels is already underway,
so fixes will roll out with the next stable kernel releases.

Recompile the kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n. This is recommended for
users who cannot wait for upstream or distro kernel updates, cannot
backport the fix themselves and do not use realtime devices.

Upstream commit
---------------

commit b31ff3cdf540110da4572e3e29bd172087af65cc
Author: Richard Wareing <rwareing () fb com>
Date:   Wed Sep 13 09:09:35 2017 +1000

    xfs: XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE() should be false if no rt device present

    If using a kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
    a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
    create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
    When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
    flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.

    This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
    xfs_blkdev_issue_flush():

      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
      IP: xfs_blkdev_issue_flush+0xd/0x20
      .....
      Call Trace:
        xfs_file_fsync+0x188/0x1c0
        vfs_fsync_range+0x3b/0xa0
        do_fsync+0x3d/0x70
        SyS_fsync+0x10/0x20
        do_syscall_64+0x4d/0xb0
        entry_SYSCALL64_slow_path+0x25/0x25

    Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any
    unprivileged user can cause this oops to occur.  To reproduce, confirm
    kernel is compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and run:

      # mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
      # mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
      # mkdir /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
      # xfs_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar

    Or just run xfstests with MKFS_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.

    Kernels built with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* Out-of-bounds kernel heap access vulnerability was found in xfrm, kernel's IP framework for transforming packets. An error dealing with netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-1000111, Important)
* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in ip\_ufo\_append\_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG\_MORE option. If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)
* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211\_CMD\_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)
* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP\_NET\_RAW) to open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)
* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet\_diag\_msg\_sctp{,l}addr\_fill() and sctp\_get\_sctp\_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)
* The mq\_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)
* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the \_\_tcp\_select\_window function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)
* A flaw was found where the XFS filesystem code mishandles a user-settable inode flag in the Linux kernel prior to 4.14-rc1. This can cause a local denial of service via a kernel panic. (CVE-2017-14340, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chaitin Security Research Lab for reporting CVE-2017-7184; Willem de Bruijn for reporting CVE-2017-1000111; and Andrey Konovalov for reporting CVE-2017-1000112. The CVE-2017-7558 issue was discovered by Stefano Brivio (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-14340 issue was discovered by Dave Chinner (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-693.5.2 source tree, which provides number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1489085)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

Debian Bug     : 866511 875881

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-7518

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug
    exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall
    instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this
    flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.

CVE-2017-7558 (stretch only)

    Stefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is
    prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read
    flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.

CVE-2017-10661 (jessie only)

    Dmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does
    not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file
    descriptor.  This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of
    service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-11600

    Bo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly
    validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial
    of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-12134 / #866511 / XSA-229

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running
    in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge
    block I/O requests.  A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this
    bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or
    potentially execution of arbitrary code.

    This issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying
    back-end block devices, e.g.:
        echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges

CVE-2017-12146 (stretch only)

    Adrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the
    "driver_override" attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If
    unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this
    might allow them to gain privileges.

CVE-2017-12153

    bo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not
    properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a
    wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-12154

    Jim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested
    hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a
    suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14106

    Andrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by
    zero in the tcp_disconnect() function could result in local denial
    of service.

CVE-2017-14140

    Otto Ebeling reported that the move_pages() system call performed
    insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target
    processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier
    for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed
    with the set-UID permission bit set.

CVE-2017-14156

    "sohu0106" reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.
    A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this
    driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-14340

    Richard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the
    creation of files with the "realtime" flag on a filesystem with no
    realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user
    with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime
    device can use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14489

    ChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not
    properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to
    memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI
    devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-14497 (stretch only)

    Benjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not
    properly handled within the tpacket_rcv() function in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000111

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to
    execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000112

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the
    UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this
    flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000251 / #875881

    Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not
    properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a
    stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities
    dubbed "Blueborne". A nearby attacker can use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a
    system with Bluetooth enabled.

CVE-2017-1000252 (stretch only)

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation
    for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt
    injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could
    use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-1000370

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or
    environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000371

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument
    orenvironment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit
    PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000380

    Alexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user
    with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain
    sensitive information.

Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then
CVE-2017-11600, CVE-2017-14497 and CVE-2017-1000111 can be exploited
by any local user.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

xfs: XFS\_IS\_REALTIME\_INODE() should be false if no rt device present
commit b31ff3cdf540110da4572e3e29bd172087af65cc upstream.
If using a kernel with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.
This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
xfs\_blkdev\_issue\_flush():
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
IP: xfs\_blkdev\_issue\_flush+0xd/0x20

Call Trace:

do\_syscall\_64+0x4d/0xb0

Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any
unprivileged user can cause this oops to occur. To reproduce, confirm
kernel is compiled with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=y and run:
# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
# mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
# mkdir /mnt/test/foo
# xfs\_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
# xfs\_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar
Or just run xfstests with MKFS\_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.
Kernels built with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.

NFSv4: Fix up mirror allocation
commit 14abcb0bf59a30cf65a74f6c6f53974cd7224bc6 upstream.
There are a number of callers of nfs\_pageio\_complete() that want to
continue using the nfs\_pageio\_descriptor without needing to call
nfs\_pageio\_init() again. Examples include nfs\_pageio\_resend() and
nfs\_pageio\_cond\_complete().
The problem is that nfs\_pageio\_complete() also calls
nfs\_pageio\_cleanup\_mirroring(), which frees up the array of mirrors.
This can lead to writeback errors, in the next call to
nfs\_pageio\_setup\_mirroring().
Fix by simply moving the allocation of the mirrors to
nfs\_pageio\_setup\_mirroring().

NFS: Sync the correct byte range during synchronous writes
commit e973b1a5999e57da677ab50da5f5479fdc0f0c31 upstream.
Since commit 18290650b1c8 ("NFS: Move buffered I/O locking into
nfs\_file\_write()") nfs\_file\_write() has not flushed the correct byte
range during synchronous writes. generic\_write\_sync() expects that
iocb->ki\_pos points to the right edge of the range rather than the
left edge.
To replicate the problem, open a file with O\_DSYNC, have the client
write at increasing offsets, and then print the successful offsets.
Block port 2049 partway through that sequence, and observe that the
client application indicates successful writes in advance of what the
server received.

ARM: 8692/1: mm: abort uaccess retries upon fatal signal
commit 746a272e44141af24a02f6c9b0f65f4c4598ed42 upstream.
When there's a fatal signal pending, arm's do\_page\_fault()
implementation returns 0. The intent is that we'll return to the
faulting userspace instruction, delivering the signal on the way.
However, if we take a fatal signal during fixing up a uaccess, this
results in a return to the faulting kernel instruction, which will be
instantly retried, resulting in the same fault being taken forever. As
the task never reaches userspace, the signal is not delivered, and the
task is left unkillable. While the task is stuck in this state, it can
inhibit the forward progress of the system.
To avoid this, we must ensure that when a fatal signal is pending, we
apply any necessary fixup for a faulting kernel instruction. Thus we
will return to an error path, and it is up to that code to make forward
progress towards delivering the fatal signal.

Revert "firmware: add sanity check on shutdown/suspend"
commit f007cad159e99fa2acd3b2e9364fbb32ad28b971 upstream.
This reverts commit 81f95076281fdd3bc382e004ba1bce8e82fccbce.
It causes random failures of firmware loading at resume time (well,
random for me, it seems to be more reliable for others) because the
firmware disabling is not actually synchronous with any particular
resume event, and at least the btusb driver that uses a workqueue to
load the firmware at resume seems to occasionally hit the "firmware
loading is disabled" logic because the firmware loader hasn't gotten the
resume event yet.
Some kind of sanity check for not trying to load firmware when it's not
possible might be a good thing, but this commit was not it.
Greg seems to have silently suffered the same issue, and pointed to the
likely culprit, and Gabriel C verified the revert fixed it for him too.

KVM: SVM: Limit PFERR\_NESTED\_GUEST\_PAGE error\_code check to L1 guest
commit 64531a3b70b17c8d3e77f2e49e5e1bb70f571266 upstream.
Commit 147277540bbc ("kvm: svm: Add support for additional SVM NPF error
codes", 2016-11-23) added a new error code to aid nested page fault
handling. The commit unprotects (kvm\_mmu\_unprotect\_page) the page when
we get a NPF due to guest page table walk where the page was marked RO.
However, if an L0->L2 shadow nested page table can also be marked read-only
when a page is read only in L1's nested page table. If such a page
is accessed by L2 while walking page tables it can cause a nested
page fault (page table walks are write accesses). However, after
kvm\_mmu\_unprotect\_page we may get another page fault, and again in an
endless stream.
To cover this use case, we qualify the new error\_code check with
vcpu->arch.mmu\_direct\_map so that the error\_code check would run on L1
guest, and not the L2 guest. This avoids hitting the above scenario.

Similarly, ida\_pre\_get() only needs to call preempt\_enable() in the

btrfs: resume qgroup rescan on rw remount
commit 6c6b5a39c4bf3dbd8cf629c9f5450e983c19dbb9 upstream.
Several distributions mount the "proper root" as ro during initrd and
then remount it as rw before pivot\_root(2). Thus, if a rescan had been
aborted by a previous shutdown, the rescan would never be resumed.
This issue would manifest itself as several btrfs ioctl(2)s causing the
entire machine to hang when btrfs\_qgroup\_wait\_for\_completion was hit
(due to the fs\_info->qgroup\_rescan\_running flag being set but the rescan
itself not being resumed). Notably, Docker's btrfs storage driver makes
regular use of BTRFS\_QUOTA\_CTL\_DISABLE and BTRFS\_IOC\_QUOTA\_RESCAN\_WAIT
(causing this problem to be manifested on boot for some machines).

mtd: nand: qcom: fix config error for BCH
commit 10777de570016471fd929869c7830a7772893e39 upstream.
The configuration for BCH is not correct in the current driver.
The ECC\_CFG\_ECC\_DISABLE bit defines whether to enable or disable the
BCH ECC in which
0x1 : BCH\_DISABLED
0x0 : BCH\_ENABLED
But currently host->bch\_enabled is being assigned to BCH\_DISABLED.

The NAND page read fails without complete boot chain since
NAND\_DEV\_CMD\_VLD value is not proper. The default power on reset

The READ\_START\_VALID should be enabled for sending PAGE\_READ

Commit a894cf6c5a82 ("mtd: nand: mxc: switch to mtd\_ooblayout\_ops")
introduced a bug in the OOB layout description. Even if the driver claims
that 3 ECC bytes are reserved to protect 512 bytes of data, it's actually
5 ECC bytes to protect 512+6 bytes of data (some OOB bytes are also
protected using extra ECC bytes).
Fix the mxc\_v1\_ooblayout\_{free,ecc}() functions to reflect this behavior.

mtd: nand: hynix: add support for 20nm NAND chips
commit fd213b5bae800dc00a2930dcd07f63ab9bbff3f9 upstream.
According to the datasheet of the H27UCG8T2BTR the NAND Technology field
(6th byte of the "Device Identifier Description", bits 0-2) the
following values are possible:
- 0x0 = 48nm
- 0x1 = 41nm
- 0x2 = 32nm
- 0x3 = 26nm
- 0x4 = 20nm
- (all others are reserved)
Fix this by extending the mask for this field to allow detecting value
0x4 (20nm) as valid NAND technology.
Without this the detection of the ECC requirements fails, because the
code assumes that the device is a 48nm device (0x4 & 0x3 = 0x0) and
aborts with "Invalid ECC requirements" because it cannot map the "ECC
Level". Extending the mask makes the ECC requirement detection code
recognize this chip as <= 26nm and sets up the ECC step size and ECC
strength correctly.

mtd: nand: make Samsung SLC NAND usable again
commit 69fc01296c92814b62dbfba1600fe7ed2ed304f5 upstream.
commit c51d0ac59f24 ("mtd: nand: Move Samsung specific init/detection
logic in nand\_samsung.c") introduced a regression for Samsung SLC NAND
chips. Prior to this commit chip->bits\_per\_cell was initialized by calling
nand\_get\_bits\_per\_cell() before using nand\_is\_slc().
With the offending commit this call is skipped, leaving
chip->bits\_per\_cell cleared to zero when the manufacturer specific
'.detect' function calls nand\_is\_slc() which in turn interprets
bits\_per\_cell != 1 as indication for an MLC chip.
The effect is that e.g. a K9F1G08U0F NAND chip is falsely detected as
MLC NAND with 4KiB page size rather than SLC with 2KiB page size.
Add a call to nand\_get\_bits\_per\_cell() before calling the .detect hook
function in nand\_manufacturer\_detect(), so that the nand\_is\_slc()
calls in the manufacturer specific code will return correct results.

xfs: XFS\_IS\_REALTIME\_INODE() should be false if no rt device presentIf using a kernel with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.
This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
xfs\_blkdev\_issue\_flush():
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
IP: xfs\_blkdev\_issue\_flush+0xd/0x20
.....
Call Trace:
xfs\_file\_fsync+0x188/0x1c0
vfs\_fsync\_range+0x3b/0xa0
do\_fsync+0x3d/0x70
SyS\_fsync+0x10/0x20
do\_syscall\_64+0x4d/0xb0
entry\_SYSCALL64\_slow\_path+0x25/0x25
Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any
unprivileged user can cause this oops to occur. To reproduce, confirm
kernel is compiled with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=y and run:
# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
# mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
# mkdir /mnt/test/foo
# xfs\_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
# xfs\_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar
Or just run xfstests with MKFS\_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.
Kernels built with CONFIG\_XFS\_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.

xfs: XFS\_IS\_REALTIME\_INODE() should be false if no rt device present

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/b31ff3cdf540110da4572e3e29bd172087af65cc)

```
If using a kernel with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and we set the RHINHERIT flag on
a directory in a filesystem that does not have a realtime device and
create a new file in that directory, it gets marked as a real time file.
When data is written and a fsync is issued, the filesystem attempts to
flush a non-existent rt device during the fsync process.

This results in a crash dereferencing a null buftarg pointer in
xfs_blkdev_issue_flush():

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000008
  IP: xfs_blkdev_issue_flush+0xd/0x20
  .....
  Call Trace:
    xfs_file_fsync+0x188/0x1c0
    vfs_fsync_range+0x3b/0xa0
    do_fsync+0x3d/0x70
    SyS_fsync+0x10/0x20
    do_syscall_64+0x4d/0xb0
    entry_SYSCALL64_slow_path+0x25/0x25

Setting RT inode flags does not require special privileges so any
unprivileged user can cause this oops to occur.  To reproduce, confirm
kernel is compiled with CONFIG_XFS_RT=y and run:

  # mkfs.xfs -f /dev/pmem0
  # mount /dev/pmem0 /mnt/test
  # mkdir /mnt/test/foo
  # xfs_io -c 'chattr +t' /mnt/test/foo
  # xfs_io -f -c 'pwrite 0 5m' -c fsync /mnt/test/foo/bar

Or just run xfstests with MKFS_OPTIONS="-d rtinherit=1" and wait.

Kernels built with CONFIG_XFS_RT=n are not exposed to this bug.
