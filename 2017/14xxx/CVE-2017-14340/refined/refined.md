{
  "CVE-2017-14340": {
    "Description": "The XFS filesystem code mishandles a user-settable inode flag in the Linux kernel prior to 4.14-rc1. This can cause a local denial of service via a kernel panic.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "XFS mishandles FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT and FS_XFLAG_REALTIME flags when the filesystem does not have a realtime device configured.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The kernel allows users to set the FS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT flag on directories, leading to files inheriting the FS_XFLAG_REALTIME flag when created in these directories.",
      "When an fsync/fdatasync operation is run on such an inode, the kernel attempts to flush the cache of the non-existent realtime device, causing a null pointer dereference and kernel panic."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local denial of service via a kernel oops (panic).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to a vulnerable XFS filesystem.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any unprivileged user with write permission to a directory on a vulnerable XFS filesystem, where CONFIG_XFS_RT=y."
  }
