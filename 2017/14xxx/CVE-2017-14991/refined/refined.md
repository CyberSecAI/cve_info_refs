Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-14991:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3754-1) explicitly mentions CVE-2017-14991, stating: "It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data returned to user space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory)."
   - This description aligns with the identified vulnerability in the provided kernel commit log and code diff.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in the `sg_ioctl` function within the generic SCSI driver (`drivers/scsi/sg.c`). Specifically, when handling the `SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE` ioctl, the driver was allocating memory for the request table using `kmalloc`, but not initializing it using `memset` before filling it with data. This resulted in uninitialized kernel memory being returned to user space.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information leak. The `SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE` ioctl is intended to return information about SCSI requests. However, due to the lack of initialization of allocated memory, it was returning uninitialized kernel memory.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - **Information Exposure:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary kernel memory by using the `SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE` ioctl, as the uninitialized memory could contain sensitive information.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   - **Local access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system. The attacker needs to be able to open a device and perform the `SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE` ioctl.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - **Local user:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the target system with the ability to interact with SCSI devices using ioctl commands.
   - No specific privileges are mentioned beyond the ability to interact with the SCSI device file.

**Technical Details:**

- The code diff shows the fix.  The `kmalloc` was replaced with `kzalloc`, which initializes the allocated memory with zeros. This ensures the memory being passed back to user space is not leaking kernel information.
- The vulnerability exists due to using `kmalloc` instead of `kzalloc`.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in CVE-2017-14991 is an information leak in the generic SCSI driver, where the `SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE` ioctl could expose uninitialized kernel memory to a local user. The fix replaces `kmalloc` with `kzalloc` to ensure the memory is initialized with zeros before being returned to user space, preventing the leak.
