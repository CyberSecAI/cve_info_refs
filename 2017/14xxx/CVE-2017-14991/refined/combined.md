iwlwifi: add workaround to disable wide channels in 5GHz
commit 01a9c948a09348950515bf2abb6113ed83e696d8 upstream.
The OTP in some SKUs have erroneously allowed 40MHz and 80MHz channels
in the 5.2GHz band. The firmware has been modified to not allow this
in those SKUs, so the driver needs to do the same otherwise the
firmware will assert when we try to use it.

sched/cpuset/pm: Fix cpuset vs. suspend-resume bugs
commit 50e76632339d4655859523a39249dd95ee5e93e7 upstream.
Cpusets vs. suspend-resume is \_completely\_ broken. And it got noticed
because it now resulted in non-cpuset usage breaking too.
On suspend cpuset\_cpu\_inactive() doesn't call into
cpuset\_update\_active\_cpus() because it doesn't want to move tasks about,
there is no need, all tasks are frozen and won't run again until after
we've resumed everything.
But this means that when we finally do call into
cpuset\_update\_active\_cpus() after resuming the last frozen cpu in
cpuset\_cpu\_active(), the top\_cpuset will not have any difference with
the cpu\_active\_mask and this it will not in fact do \_anything\_.
So the cpuset configuration will not be restored. This was largely
hidden because we would unconditionally create identity domains and
mobile users would not in fact use cpusets much. And servers what do use
cpusets tend to not suspend-resume much.
An addition problem is that we'd not in fact wait for the cpuset work to
finish before resuming the tasks, allowing spurious migrations outside
of the specified domains.
Fix the rebuild by introducing cpuset\_force\_rebuild() and fix the
ordering with cpuset\_wait\_for\_hotplug().

bcache: fix bch\_hprint crash and improve output
commit 9276717b9e297a62d1151a43d1cd286213f68eb7 upstream.
Most importantly, solve a crash where %llu was used to format signed
numbers. This would cause a buffer overflow when reading sysfs
writeback\_rate\_debug, as only 20 bytes were allocated for this and
%llu writes 20 characters plus a null.
Always use the units mechanism rather than having different output
paths for simplicity.
Also, correct problems with display output where 1.10 was a larger
number than 1.09, by multiplying by 10 and then dividing by 1024 instead
of dividing by 100. (Remainders of >= 1000 would print as .10).
Minor changes: Always display the decimal point instead of trying to
omit it based on number of digits shown. Decide what units to use
based on 1000 as a threshold, not 1024 (in other words, always print
at most 3 digits before the decimal point).

bcache: fix sequential large write IO bypass
commit c81ffa32a214c84b08900fbc9d432187bd948eba upstream.
Sequential write IOs were tested with bs=1M by FIO in writeback cache
mode, these IOs were expected to be bypassed, but actually they did not.
We debug the code, and find in check\_should\_bypass():
if (!congested &&
mode == CACHE\_MODE\_WRITEBACK &&
op\_is\_write(bio\_op(bio)) &&
(bio-ï¼žbi\_opf & REQ\_SYNC))
goto rescale
that means, If in writeback mode, a write IO with REQ\_SYNC flag will not
be bypassed though it is a sequential large IO, It's not a correct thing
to do actually, so this patch remove these codes.

If you encounter any errors in bch\_cached\_dev\_attach it will return
a negative error code. The variable 'v' which stores the result is
unsigned, thus user space sees a very large value returned for bytes
written which can cause incorrect user space behavior. Utilize 1
signed variable to use throughout the function to preserve error return
capability.

bcache: correct cache\_dirty\_target in \_\_update\_writeback\_rate()
commit a8394090a9129b40f9d90dcb7f4a49d60c727ca6 upstream.
\_\_update\_write\_rate() uses a Proportion-Differentiation Controller
algorithm to control writeback rate. A dirty target number is used in
this PD controller to control writeback rate. A larger target number
will make the writeback rate smaller, on the versus, a smaller target
number will make the writeback rate larger.
bcache uses the following steps to calculate the target number,
1) cache\_sectors = all-buckets-of-cache-set \* buckets-size
2) cache\_dirty\_target = cache\_sectors \* cached-device-writeback\_percent
3) target = cache\_dirty\_target \*
(sectors-of-cached-device/sectors-of-all-cached-devices-of-this-cache-set)
The calculation at step 1) for cache\_sectors is incorrect, which does
not consider dirty blocks occupied by flash only volume.
A flash only volume can be took as a bcache device without cached
device. All data sectors allocated for it are persistent on cache device
and marked dirty, they are not touched by bcache writeback and garbage
collection code. So data blocks of flash only volume should be ignore
when calculating cache\_sectors of cache set.
Current code does not subtract dirty sectors of flash only volume, which
results a larger target number from the above 3 steps. And in sequence
the cache device's writeback rate is smaller then a correct value,
writeback speed is slower on all cached devices.
This patch fixes the incorrect slower writeback rate by subtracting
dirty sectors of flash only volumes in \_\_update\_writeback\_rate().

bcache: initialize dirty stripes in flash\_dev\_run()
commit 175206cf9ab63161dec74d9cd7f9992e062491f5 upstream.
bcache uses a Proportion-Differentiation Controller algorithm to control
writeback rate to cached devices. In the PD controller algorithm, dirty
stripes of thin flash device should not be counted in, because flash only
volumes never write back dirty data.
Currently dirty stripe counter for thin flash device is not initialized
when the thin flash device starts. Which means the following calculation
in PD controller will reference an undefined dirty stripes number, and
all cached devices attached to the same cache set where the thin flash
device lies on may have an inaccurate writeback rate.
This patch calles bch\_sectors\_dirty\_init() in flash\_dev\_run(), to
correctly initialize dirty stripe counter when the thin flash device
starts to run. This patch also does following parameter data type change,
-void bch\_sectors\_dirty\_init(struct cached\_dev \*dc);
+void bch\_sectors\_dirty\_init(struct bcache\_device \*);
to call this function conveniently in flash\_dev\_run().

commit 9c7ba1d7634cef490b85bc64c4091ff004821bfd upstream.
Certain syscalls like recvmmsg support 64 bit timespec values for the
X32 ABI. The helper function compat\_put\_timespec converts a timespec
value to a 32 bit or 64 bit value depending on what ABI is used. The
v4l2 compat layer, however, is not designed to support 64 bit timespec
values and always uses 32 bit values. Hence, compat\_put\_timespec must
not be used.
Without this patch, user space will be provided with bad timestamp
values from the VIDIOC\_DQEVENT ioctl. Also, fields of the struct
v4l2\_event32 that come immediately after timestamp get overwritten,
namely the field named id.

s390/mm: fix race on mm->context.flush\_mm
commit 60f07c8ec5fae06c23e9fd7bab67dabce92b3414 upstream.
The order in \_\_tlb\_flush\_mm\_lazy is to flush TLB first and then clear
the mm->context.flush\_mm bit. This can lead to missed flushes as the
bit can be set anytime, the order needs to be the other way aronud.
But this leads to a different race, \_\_tlb\_flush\_mm\_lazy may be called
on two CPUs concurrently. If mm->context.flush\_mm is cleared first then
another CPU can bypass \_\_tlb\_flush\_mm\_lazy although the first CPU has
not done the flush yet. In a virtualized environment the time until the
flush is finally completed can be arbitrarily long.
Add a spinlock to serialize \_\_tlb\_flush\_mm\_lazy and use the function
in finish\_arch\_post\_lock\_switch as well.

s390/mm: fix local TLB flushing vs. detach of an mm address space
commit b3e5dc45fd1ec2aa1de6b80008f9295eb17e0659 upstream.
The local TLB flushing code keeps an additional mask in the mm.context,
the cpu\_attach\_mask. At the time a global flush of an address space is
done the cpu\_attach\_mask is copied to the mm\_cpumask in order to avoid
future global flushes in case the mm is used by a single CPU only after
the flush.
Trouble is that the reset of the mm\_cpumask is racy against the detach
of an mm address space by switch\_mm. The current order is first the
global TLB flush and then the copy of the cpu\_attach\_mask to the
mm\_cpumask. The order needs to be the other way around.

PCI: pciehp: Report power fault only once until we clear it
commit 7612b3b28c0b900dcbcdf5e9b9747cc20a1e2455 upstream.
When a power fault occurs, the power controller sets Power Fault Detected
in the Slot Status register, and pciehp\_isr() queues an INT\_POWER\_FAULT
event to handle it.
It also clears Power Fault Detected, but since nothing has yet changed to
correct the power fault, the power controller will likely set it again
immediately, which may cause an infinite loop when pcie\_isr() rechecks
Slot Status.
Fix that by masking off Power Fault Detected from new events if the driver
hasn't seen the power fault clear from the previous handling attempt.

ARC: Re-enable MMU upon Machine Check exception
commit 1ee55a8f7f6b7ca4c0c59e0b4b4e3584a085c2d3 upstream.
I recently came upon a scenario where I would get a double fault
machine check exception tiriggered by a kernel module.
However the ensuing crash stacktrace (ksym lookup) was not working
correctly.
Turns out that machine check auto-disables MMU while modules are allocated
in kernel vaddr spapce.
This patch re-enables the MMU before start printing the stacktrace
making stacktracing of modules work upon a fatal exception.

tracing: Apply trace\_clock changes to instance max buffer
commit 170b3b1050e28d1ba0700e262f0899ffa4fccc52 upstream.
Currently trace\_clock timestamps are applied to both regular and max
buffers only for global trace. For instance trace, trace\_clock
timestamps are applied only to regular buffer. But, regular and max
buffers can be swapped, for example, following a snapshot. So, for
instance trace, bad timestamps can be seen following a snapshot.
Let's apply trace\_clock timestamps to instance max buffer as well.

tracing: Add barrier to trace\_printk() buffer nesting modification
commit 3d9622c12c8873911f4cc0ccdabd0362c2fca06b upstream.
trace\_printk() uses 4 buffers, one for each context (normal, softirq, irq
and NMI), such that it does not need to worry about one context preempting
the other. There's a nesting counter that gets incremented to figure out
which buffer to use. If the context gets preempted by another context which
calls trace\_printk() it will increment the counter and use the next buffer,
and restore the counter when it is finished.
The problem is that gcc may optimize the modification of the buffer nesting
counter and it may not be incremented in memory before the buffer is used.
If this happens, and the context gets interrupted by another context, it
could pick the same buffer and corrupt the one that is being used.
Compiler barriers need to be added after the nesting variable is incremented
and before it is decremented to prevent usage of the context buffers by more
than one context at the same time.

ftrace: Fix memleak when unregistering dynamic ops when tracing disabled
commit edb096e00724f02db5f6ec7900f3bbd465c6c76f upstream.
If function tracing is disabled by the user via the function-trace option or
the proc sysctl file, and a ftrace\_ops that was allocated on the heap is
unregistered, then the shutdown code exits out without doing the proper
clean up. This was found via kmemleak and running the ftrace selftests, as
one of the tests unregisters with function tracing disabled.

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix an integer overflow in sysfs code
commit e6f77540c067b48dee10f1e33678415bfcc89017 upstream.
The value of "size" comes from the user. When we add "start + size" it
could lead to an integer overflow bug.
It means we vmalloc() a lot more memory than we had intended. I believe
that on 64 bit systems vmalloc() can succeed even if we ask it to
allocate huge 4GB buffers. So we would get memory corruption and likely
a crash when we call ha->isp\_ops->write\_optrom() and ->read\_optrom().
Only root can trigger this bug.

scsi: aacraid: Fix command send race condition
commit 1ae948fa4f00f3a2823e7cb19a3049ef27dd6947 upstream.
This fixes a potential race condition observed on Power systems.
Several places throughout the aacraid driver call aac\_fib\_send or
similar to send a command to the aacraid adapter, then check the return
code to determine if the command was actually sent to the adapter, then
update the phase field in the scsi command scratch pad area to track
that the firmware now owns this command. However, there is nothing that
ensures that by the time the aac\_fib\_send function returns and we go to
write to the scsi command, that the command hasn't already completed and
the scsi command has been freed. This was causing random crashes in the
TCP stack which was tracked down to be caused by memory that had been a
struct request + scsi\_cmnd being now used for an skbuff. Memory
poisoning was enabled in the kernel to debug this which showed that the
last owner of the memory that had been freed was aacraid and that it was
a struct request. The memory that was corrupted was the exact data
pattern of AAC\_OWNER\_FIRMWARE and it was at the same offset that aacraid
writes, which is scsicmd->SCp.phase. The patch below resolves this
issue.

scsi: zfcp: trace HBA FSF response by default on dismiss or timedout late response
commit fdb7cee3b9e3c561502e58137a837341f10cbf8b upstream.
At the default trace level, we only trace unsuccessful events including
FSF responses.
zfcp\_dbf\_hba\_fsf\_response() only used protocol status and FSF status to
decide on an unsuccessful response. However, this is only one of multiple
possible sources determining a failed struct zfcp\_fsf\_req.
An FSF request can also "fail" if its response runs into an ERP timeout
or if it gets dismissed because a higher level recovery was triggered
[trace tags "erscf\_1" or "erscf\_2" in zfcp\_erp\_strategy\_check\_fsfreq()].
FSF requests with ERP timeout are:
FSF\_QTCB\_EXCHANGE\_CONFIG\_DATA, FSF\_QTCB\_EXCHANGE\_PORT\_DATA,
FSF\_QTCB\_OPEN\_PORT\_WITH\_DID or FSF\_QTCB\_CLOSE\_PORT or
FSF\_QTCB\_CLOSE\_PHYSICAL\_PORT for target ports,
FSF\_QTCB\_OPEN\_LUN, FSF\_QTCB\_CLOSE\_LUN.
One example is slow queue processing which can cause follow-on errors,
e.g. FSF\_PORT\_ALREADY\_OPEN after FSF\_QTCB\_OPEN\_PORT\_WITH\_DID timed out.
In order to see the root cause, we need to see late responses even if the
channel presented them successfully with FSF\_PROT\_GOOD and FSF\_GOOD.

QTCB log length: ...
QTCB log info : ...
In case of problems detecting that new responses are waiting on the input
queue, we sooner or later trigger adapter recovery due to an FSF request
timeout (trace tag "fsrth\_1").
FSF requests with FSF request timeout are:
typically FSF\_QTCB\_ABORT\_FCP\_CMND; but theoretically also
FSF\_QTCB\_EXCHANGE\_CONFIG\_DATA or FSF\_QTCB\_EXCHANGE\_PORT\_DATA via sysfs,
FSF\_QTCB\_OPEN\_PORT\_WITH\_DID or FSF\_QTCB\_CLOSE\_PORT for WKA ports,
FSF\_QTCB\_FCP\_CMND for task management function (LUN / target reset).
One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF\_PROT\_GOOD and FSF\_GOOD
because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.
In a theroretical case, inject code can create an erroneous FSF request
on purpose. If data router is enabled, it uses deferred error reporting.
A READ SCSI command can succeed with FSF\_PROT\_GOOD, FSF\_GOOD, and
SAM\_STAT\_GOOD. But on writing the read data to host memory via DMA,
it can still fail, e.g. if an intentionally wrong scatter list does not
provide enough space. Rather than getting an unsuccessful response,
we get a QDIO activate check which in turn triggers adapter recovery.
One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF\_PROT\_GOOD and FSF\_GOOD
because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.

Only with luck in both above cases, we could see a follow-on trace record
of an unsuccesful event following a successful but late FSF response with
FSF\_PROT\_GOOD and FSF\_GOOD. Typically this was the case for I/O requests
resulting in a SCSI trace record "rsl\_err" with DID\_TRANSPORT\_DISRUPTED
[On ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_DISMISSED, zfcp\_fsf\_protstatus\_eval() sets
ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_ERROR seen by the request handler functions as failure].
However, the reason for this follow-on trace was invisible because the
corresponding HBA trace record was missing at the default trace level
(by default hidden records with tags "fs\_norm", "fs\_qtcb", or "fs\_open").
On adapter recovery, after we had shut down the QDIO queues, we perform
unsuccessful pseudo completions with flag ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_DISMISSED
for each pending FSF request in zfcp\_fsf\_req\_dismiss\_all().
In order to find the root cause, we need to see all pseudo responses even
if the channel presented them successfully with FSF\_PROT\_GOOD and FSF\_GOOD.
Therefore, check zfcp\_fsf\_req.status for ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_DISMISSED
or ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_ERROR and trace with a new tag "fs\_rerr".
It does not matter that there are numerous places which set
ZFCP\_STATUS\_FSFREQ\_ERROR after the location where we trace an FSF response
early. These cases are based on protocol status != FSF\_PROT\_GOOD or
== FSF\_PROT\_FSF\_STATUS\_PRESENTED and are thus already traced by default
as trace tag "fs\_perr" or "fs\_ferr" respectively.
NB: The trace record with tag "fssrh\_1" for status read buffers on dismiss
all remains. zfcp\_fsf\_req\_complete() handles this and returns early.
All other FSF request types are handled separately and as described above.

scsi: zfcp: fix payload with full FCP\_RSP IU in SCSI trace records
commit 12c3e5754c8022a4f2fd1e9f00d19e99ee0d3cc1 upstream.
If the FCP\_RSP UI has optional parts (FCP\_SNS\_INFO or FCP\_RSP\_INFO) and
thus does not fit into the fsp\_rsp field built into a SCSI trace record,
trace the full FCP\_RSP UI with all optional parts as payload record
instead of just FCP\_SNS\_INFO as payload and
a 1 byte RSP\_INFO\_CODE part of FCP\_RSP\_INFO built into the SCSI record.
That way we would also get the full FCP\_SNS\_INFO in case a
target would ever send more than
min(SCSI\_SENSE\_BUFFERSIZE==96, ZFCP\_DBF\_PAY\_MAX\_REC==256)==96.
The mandatory part of FCP\_RSP IU is only 24 bytes.
PAYload costs at least one full PAY record of 256 bytes anyway.
We cap to the hardware response size which is only FSF\_FCP\_RSP\_SIZE==128.
So we can just put the whole FCP\_RSP IU with any optional parts into
PAYload similarly as we do for SAN PAY since v4.9 commit aceeffbb59bb
("zfcp: trace full payload of all SAN records (req,resp,iels)").
This does not cause any additional trace records wasting memory.
Decoded trace records were confusing because they showed a hard-coded
sense data length of 96 even if the FCP\_RSP\_IU field FCP\_SNS\_LEN showed
actually less.
Since the same commit, we set pl\_len for SAN traces to the full length of a
request/response even if we cap the corresponding trace.
In contrast, here for SCSI traces we set pl\_len to the pre-computed
length of FCP\_RSP IU considering SNS\_LEN or RSP\_LEN if valid.
Nonetheless we trace a hardcoded payload of length FSF\_FCP\_RSP\_SIZE==128
if there were optional parts.
This makes it easier for the zfcpdbf tool to format only the relevant
part of the long FCP\_RSP UI buffer. And any trailing information is still
available in the payload trace record just in case.
Rename the payload record tag from "fcp\_sns" to "fcp\_riu" to make the new
content explicit to zfcpdbf which can then pick a suitable field name such
as "FCP rsp IU all:" instead of "Sense info :"
Also, the same zfcpdbf can still be backwards compatible with "fcp\_sns".

a trace record:

on fc\_block\_scsi\_eh() returning != 0 which is FAST\_IO\_FAIL,

scsi: zfcp: fix passing fsf\_req to SCSI trace on TMF to correlate with HBA
commit 9fe5d2b2fd30aa8c7827ec62cbbe6d30df4fe3e3 upstream.
Without this fix we get SCSI trace records on task management functions
which cannot be correlated to HBA trace records because all fields
related to the FSF request are empty (zero).
Also, the FCP\_RSP\_IU is missing as well as any sense data if available.
This was caused by v2.6.14 commit 8a36e4532ea1 ("[SCSI] zfcp: enhancement
of zfcp debug features") introducing trace records for TMFs but
hard coding NULL for a possibly existing TMF FSF request.
The scsi\_cmnd scribble is also zero or unrelated for the TMF request
so it also could not lookup a suitable FSF request from there.

There are some true cases where we really do not have an FSF request:
"rsl\_fai" from zfcp\_dbf\_scsi\_fail\_send() called for early
returns / completions in zfcp\_scsi\_queuecommand(),
"abrt\_or", "abrt\_bl", "abrt\_ru", "abrt\_ar" from
zfcp\_scsi\_eh\_abort\_handler() where we did not get as far,
"lr\_nres", "tr\_nres" from zfcp\_task\_mgmt\_function() where we're
successful and do not need to do anything because adapter stopped.
For these cases it's correct to pass NULL for fsf\_req to \_zfcp\_dbf\_scsi().

scsi: zfcp: fix capping of unsuccessful GPN\_FT SAN response trace records
commit 975171b4461be296a35e83ebd748946b81cf0635 upstream.
v4.9 commit aceeffbb59bb ("zfcp: trace full payload of all SAN records
(req,resp,iels)") fixed trace data loss of 2.6.38 commit 2c55b750a884
("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for SAN records.")
necessary for problem determination, e.g. to see the
currently active zone set during automatic port scan.
While it already saves space by not dumping any empty residual entries
of the large successful GPN\_FT response (4 pages), there are seldom cases
where the GPN\_FT response is unsuccessful and likely does not have
FC\_NS\_FID\_LAST set in fp\_flags so we did not cap the trace record.
We typically see such case for an initiator WWPN, which is not in any zone.
Cap unsuccessful responses to at least the actual basic CT\_IU response
plus whatever fits the SAN trace record built-in "payload" buffer
just in case there's trailing information
of which we would at least see the existence and its beginning.
In order not to erroneously cap successful responses, we need to swap
calling the trace function and setting the CT / ELS status to success (0).

scsi: zfcp: add handling for FCP\_RESID\_OVER to the fcp ingress path
commit a099b7b1fc1f0418ab8d79ecf98153e1e134656e upstream.
Up until now zfcp would just ignore the FCP\_RESID\_OVER flag in the FCP
response IU. When this flag is set, it is possible, in regards to the
FCP standard, that the storage-server processes the command normally, up
to the point where data is missing and simply ignores those.
In this case no CHECK CONDITION would be set, and because we ignored the
FCP\_RESID\_OVER flag we resulted in at least a data loss or even
-corruption as a follow-up error, depending on how the
applications/layers on top behave. To prevent this, we now set the
host-byte of the corresponding scsi\_cmnd to DID\_ERROR.
Other storage-behaviors, where the same condition results in a CHECK
CONDITION set in the answer, don't need to be changed as they are
handled in the mid-layer already.
Following is an example trace record decoded with zfcpdbf from the
s390-tools package. We forcefully injected a fc\_dl which is one byte too
small:

As of now, we don't actively handle to possibility that a response IU
has both flags - FCP\_RESID\_OVER and FCP\_RESID\_UNDER - set at once.

scsi: zfcp: fix queuecommand for scsi\_eh commands when DIX enabled
commit 71b8e45da51a7b64a23378221c0a5868bd79da4f upstream.
Since commit db007fc5e20c ("[SCSI] Command protection operation"),
scsi\_eh\_prep\_cmnd() saves scmd->prot\_op and temporarily resets it to
SCSI\_PROT\_NORMAL.
Other FCP LLDDs such as qla2xxx and lpfc shield their queuecommand()
to only access any of scsi\_prot\_sg...() if
(scsi\_get\_prot\_op(cmd) != SCSI\_PROT\_NORMAL).
Do the same thing for zfcp, which introduced DIX support with
commit ef3eb71d8ba4 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Introduce experimental support for
DIF/DIX").
Otherwise, TUR SCSI commands as part of scsi\_eh likely fail in zfcp,
because the regular SCSI command with DIX protection data, that scsi\_eh
re-uses in scsi\_send\_eh\_cmnd(), of course still has
(scsi\_prot\_sg\_count() != 0) and so zfcp sends down bogus requests to the
FCP channel hardware.
This causes scsi\_eh\_test\_devices() to have (finish\_cmds == 0)
[not SCSI device is online or not scsi\_eh\_tur() failed]
so regular SCSI commands, that caused / were affected by scsi\_eh,
are moved to work\_q and scsi\_eh\_test\_devices() itself returns false.
In turn, it unnecessarily escalates in our case in scsi\_eh\_ready\_devs()
beyond host reset to finally scsi\_eh\_offline\_sdevs()
which sets affected SCSI devices offline with the following kernel message:
"kernel: sd H:0:T:L: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery"

md/bitmap: disable bitmap\_resize for file-backed bitmaps.
commit e8a27f836f165c26f867ece7f31eb5c811692319 upstream.
bitmap\_resize() does not work for file-backed bitmaps.
The buffer\_heads are allocated and initialized when
the bitmap is read from the file, but resize doesn't
read from the file, it loads from the internal bitmap.
When it comes time to write the new bitmap, the bh is
non-existent and we crash.
The common case when growing an array involves making the array larger,
and that normally means making the bitmap larger. Doing
that inside the kernel is possible, but would need more code.
It is probably easier to require people who use file-backed
bitmaps to remove them and re-add after a reshape.
So this patch disables the resizing of arrays which have
file-backed bitmaps. This is better than crashing.

md/bitmap: copy correct data for bitmap super
commit 8031c3ddc70ab93099e7d1814382dba39f57b43e upstream.
raid5 cache could write bitmap superblock before bitmap superblock is
initialized. The bitmap superblock is less than 512B. The current code will
only copy the superblock to a new page and write the whole 512B, which will
zero the the data after the superblock. Unfortunately the data could include
bitmap, which we should preserve. The patch will make superblock read do 4k
chunk and we always copy the 4k data to new page, so the superblock write will
old data to disk and we don't change the bitmap.

block: directly insert blk-mq request from blk\_insert\_cloned\_request()
commit 157f377beb710e84bd8bc7a3c4475c0674ebebd7 upstream.
A NULL pointer crash was reported for the case of having the BFQ IO
scheduler attached to the underlying blk-mq paths of a DM multipath
device. The crash occured in blk\_mq\_sched\_insert\_request()'s call to
e->type->ops.mq.insert\_requests().
Paolo Valente correctly summarized why the crash occured with:
"the call chain (dm\_mq\_queue\_rq -> map\_request -> setup\_clone ->
blk\_rq\_prep\_clone) creates a cloned request without invoking
e->type->ops.mq.prepare\_request for the target elevator e. The cloned
request is therefore not initialized for the scheduler, but it is
however inserted into the scheduler by blk\_mq\_sched\_insert\_request."
All said, a request-based DM multipath device's IO scheduler should be
the only one used -- when the original requests are issued to the
underlying paths as cloned requests they are inserted directly in the
underlying dispatch queue(s) rather than through an additional elevator.
But commit bd166ef18 ("blk-mq-sched: add framework for MQ capable IO
schedulers") switched blk\_insert\_cloned\_request() from using
blk\_mq\_insert\_request() to blk\_mq\_sched\_insert\_request(). Which
incorrectly added elevator machinery into a call chain that isn't
supposed to have any.
To fix this introduce a blk-mq private blk\_mq\_request\_bypass\_insert()
that blk\_insert\_cloned\_request() calls to insert the request without
involving any elevator that may be attached to the cloned request's
request\_queue.

powerpc: Fix DAR reporting when alignment handler faults
commit f9effe925039cf54489b5c04e0d40073bb3a123d upstream.
Anton noticed that if we fault part way through emulating an unaligned
instruction, we don't update the DAR to reflect that.
The DAR value is eventually reported back to userspace as the address
in the SEGV signal, and if userspace is using that value to demand
fault then it can be confused by us not setting the value correctly.
This patch is ugly as hell, but is intended to be the minimal fix and
back ports easily.

cxl: Fix driver use count
commit 197267d0356004a31c4d6b6336598f5dff3301e1 upstream.
cxl keeps a driver use count, which is used with the hash memory model
on p8 to know when to upgrade local TLBIs to global and to trigger
callbacks to manage the MMU for PSL8.
If a process opens a context and closes without attaching or fails the
attachment, the driver use count is never decremented. As a
consequence, TLB invalidations remain global, even if there are no
active cxl contexts.
We should increment the driver use count when the process is attaching
to the cxl adapter, and not on open. It's not needed before the
adapter starts using the context and the use count is decremented on
the detach path, so it makes more sense.
It affects only the user api. The kernel api is already doing The
Right Thing.

In order to ensure that the "sta" remains alive (and consistent) for the
duration of bss\_info\_changed() mutual exclusion has to be ensured with
sta\_remove().
This is done by introducing a mutex to cover firmware configuration
changes, which is made to also ensure mutual exclusion between other
operations changing the state or configuration of the firmware. With
this we can drop the rcu read lock.

The original patch from Tony uses standby mode bit inverted, which is

crypto: AF\_ALG - remove SGL terminator indicator when chaining
Fixed differently upstream as commit 2d97591ef43d ("crypto: af\_alg - consolidation of duplicate code")
The SGL is MAX\_SGL\_ENTS + 1 in size. The last SG entry is used for the
chaining and is properly updated with the sg\_chain invocation. During
the filling-in of the initial SG entries, sg\_mark\_end is called for each
SG entry. This is appropriate as long as no additional SGL is chained
with the current SGL. However, when a new SGL is chained and the last
SG entry is updated with sg\_chain, the last but one entry still contains
the end marker from the sg\_mark\_end. This end marker must be removed as
otherwise a walk of the chained SGLs will cause a NULL pointer
dereference at the last but one SG entry, because sg\_next will return
NULL.
The patch only applies to all kernels up to and including 4.13. The
patch 2d97591ef43d0587be22ad1b0d758d6df4999a0b added to 4.14-rc1
introduced a complete new code base which addresses this bug in
a different way. Yet, that patch is too invasive for stable kernels
and was therefore not marked for stable.

MIPS: math-emu: .: Fix NaN propagation
commit e840be6e7057757befc3581e1699e30fe7f0dd51 upstream.
Fix the cases of . when any of three inputs is any
NaN. Correct behavior of . fd, fs, ft is following:
- if any of inputs is sNaN, return a sNaN using following rules: if
only one input is sNaN, return that one; if more than one input is
sNaN, order of precedence for return value is fd, fs, ft
- if no input is sNaN, but at least one of inputs is qNaN, return a
qNaN using following rules: if only one input is qNaN, return that
one; if more than one input is qNaN, order of precedence for
return value is fd, fs, ft
The previous code contained correct handling of some above cases, but
not all. Also, such handling was scattered into various cases of
"switch (CLPAIR(xc, yc))" statement, and elsewhere. With this patch,
this logic is placed in one place, and "switch (CLPAIR(xc, yc))" is
significantly simplified.
A relevant example:
MADDF.S fd,fs,ft:
If fs contains qNaN1, ft contains qNaN2, and fd contains qNaN3, fd
is going to contain qNaN3 (without this patch, it used to contain
qNaN1).

MIPS: math-emu: .: Fix quiet NaN propagation
commit e78bf0dc4789bdea1453595ae89e8db65918e22e upstream.
Fix the value returned by . fd,fs,ft, if both
inputs are quiet NaNs. The . specifications
state that the returned value in such cases should be the quiet NaN
contained in register fs.
A relevant example:
MAX.S fd,fs,ft:
If fs contains qNaN1, and ft contains qNaN2, fd is going to contain
qNaN1 (without this patch, it used to contain qNaN2).

pinctrl/amd: save pin registers over suspend/resume
commit 79d2c8bede2c93f9432d7da0bc2f76a195c90fc0 upstream.
The touchpad in the Asus laptop models X505BA/BP and X542BA/BP is
unresponsive after suspend/resume. The following error appears during
resume:
i2c\_hid i2c-ELAN1300:00: failed to reset device.
The problem here is that i2c\_hid does not notice the interrupt being
generated at this point, because the GPIO is no longer configured
for interrupts.
Fix this by saving pinctrl-amd pin registers during suspend and
restoring them at resume time.
Based on code from pinctrl-intel.

pinctrl: samsung: Fix NULL pointer exception on external interrupts on S3C24xx
commit cee7413d84044a0c1919a7c70a2d761ae24390de upstream.
After commit 8b1bd11c1f8f ("pinctrl: samsung: Add the support the
multiple IORESOURCE\_MEM for one pin-bank"), the S3C24xx (and probably
S3C64xx as well) fails:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000a8
...
(s3c24xx\_demux\_eint4\_7) from [] (\_\_handle\_domain\_irq+0x6c/0xcc)
(\_\_handle\_domain\_irq) from [] (s3c24xx\_handle\_irq+0x6c/0x12c)
(s3c24xx\_handle\_irq) from [] (\_\_irq\_svc+0x5c/0x78)
Mentioned commit moved the pointer to controller's base IO memory address
from each controller's driver data (samsung\_pinctrl\_drv\_data) to per-bank
structure (samsung\_pin\_bank). The external interrupt demux
handlers (s3c24xx\_demux\_eint()) tried to get this base address from opaque
pointer stored under irq\_chip data:
struct irq\_data \*irqd = irq\_desc\_get\_irq\_data(desc);
struct samsung\_pin\_bank \*bank = irq\_data\_get\_irq\_chip\_data(irqd);
...
pend = readl(bank->eint\_base + EINTPEND\_REG);
which is wrong because this is hardware irq and it bank was never set
for this irq\_chip.
For S3C24xx and S3C64xx, this partially reverts mentioned commit by
bringing back the virt\_base stored under each controller's driver data
(samsung\_pinctrl\_drv\_data). This virt\_base address will be now
duplicated:
- samsung\_pinctrl\_drv\_data->virt\_base: used on S3C24xx and S3C64xx,
- samsung\_pin\_bank->pctl\_base: used on Exynos.

pinctrl: samsung: Fix invalid register offset used for Exynos5433 external interrupts
commit af0b0baa89953aed07034725023371b2fa50a1e6 upstream.
When setting the pin function for external interrupts, the driver used
wrong IO memory address base. The pin function register is always under
pctl\_base, not the eint\_base.
By updating wrong register, the external interrupts for chosen GPIO
would not work at all and some other GPIO might be configured to wrong
value. For example on Exynos5433-based boards, the external interrupts
for gpf{1-5}-X GPIOs should not work at all (driver toggled reserved
registers from ALIVE bank instead).
Platforms other than Exynos5433 should not be affected as eint\_base
equals pctl\_base in such case.

tty: fix \_\_tty\_insert\_flip\_char regression

Sergey noticed a small but fatal mistake in \_\_tty\_insert\_flip\_char,
leading to an oops in an interrupt handler when using any serial
port.
The problem is that I accidentally took the tty\_buffer pointer
before calling \_\_tty\_buffer\_request\_room(), which replaces the
buffer. This moves the pointer lookup to the right place after

tty: improve tty\_insert\_flip\_char() slow path
commit 065ea0a7afd64d6cf3464bdd1d8cd227527e2045 upstream.
While working on improving the fast path of tty\_insert\_flip\_char(),
I noticed that by calling tty\_buffer\_request\_room(), we needlessly
move to the separate flag buffer mode for the tty, even when all
characters use TTY\_NORMAL as the flag.
This changes the code to call \_\_tty\_buffer\_request\_room() with the
correct flag, which will then allocate a regular buffer when it rounds
out of space but no special flags have been used. I'm guessing that
this is the behavior that Peter Hurley intended when he introduced
the compacted flip buffers.

tty: improve tty\_insert\_flip\_char() fast path
commit 979990c6284814617d8f2179d197f72ff62b5d85 upstream.
kernelci.org reports a crazy stack usage for the VT code when CONFIG\_KASAN
is enabled:
drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c: In function 'kbd\_keycode':
drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c:1452:1: error: the frame size of 2240 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
The problem is that tty\_insert\_flip\_char() gets inlined many times into
kbd\_keycode(), and also into other functions, and each copy requires 128
bytes for stack redzone to check for a possible out-of-bounds access on
the 'ch' and 'flags' arguments that are passed into
tty\_insert\_flip\_string\_flags as a variable-length string.
This introduces a new \_\_tty\_insert\_flip\_char() function for the slow
path, which receives the two arguments by value. This completely avoids
the problem and the stack usage goes back down to around 100 bytes.
Without KASAN, this is also slightly better, as we don't have to
spill the arguments to the stack but can simply pass 'ch' and 'flag'
in registers, saving a few bytes in .text for each call site.
This should be backported to linux-4.0 or later, which first introduced
the stack sanitizer in the kernel.

smp/hotplug: Handle removal correctly in cpuhp\_store\_callbacks()
commit 0c96b27305faf06c068b45e07d28336c80dac286 upstream.
If cpuhp\_store\_callbacks() is called for CPUHP\_AP\_ONLINE\_DYN or
CPUHP\_BP\_PREPARE\_DYN, which are the indicators for dynamically allocated
states, then cpuhp\_store\_callbacks() allocates a new dynamic state. The
first allocation in each range returns CPUHP\_AP\_ONLINE\_DYN or
CPUHP\_BP\_PREPARE\_DYN.
If cpuhp\_remove\_state() is invoked for one of these states, then there is
no protection against the allocation mechanism. So the removal, which
should clear the callbacks and the name, gets a new state assigned and
clears that one.
As a consequence the state which should be cleared stays initialized. A
consecutive CPU hotplug operation dereferences the state callbacks and
accesses either freed or reused memory, resulting in crashes.
Add a protection against this by checking the name argument for NULL. If
it's NULL it's a removal. If not, it's an allocation.

srcu: Provide ordering for CPU not involved in grace period
commit 35732cf9dd38b1efb0f2f22c91c61b51337d1ac3 upstream.
Tree RCU guarantees that every online CPU has a memory barrier between
any given grace period and any of that CPU's RCU read-side sections that
must be ordered against that grace period. Since RCU doesn't always
know where read-side critical sections are, the actual implementation
guarantees order against prior and subsequent non-idle non-offline code,
whether in an RCU read-side critical section or not. As a result, there
does not need to be a memory barrier at the end of synchronize\_rcu()
and friends because the ordering internal to the grace period has
ordered every CPU's post-grace-period execution against each CPU's
pre-grace-period execution, again for all non-idle online CPUs.
In contrast, SRCU can have non-idle online CPUs that are completely
uninvolved in a given SRCU grace period, for example, a CPU that
never runs any SRCU read-side critical sections and took no part in
the grace-period processing. It is in theory possible for a given
synchronize\_srcu()'s wakeup to be delivered to a CPU that was completely
uninvolved in the prior SRCU grace period, which could mean that the
code following that synchronize\_srcu() would end up being unordered with
respect to both the grace period and any pre-existing SRCU read-side
critical sections.
This commit therefore adds an smp\_mb() to the end of \_\_synchronize\_srcu(),
which prevents this scenario from occurring.

IB/{qib, hfi1}: Avoid flow control testing for RDMA write operation
commit 5b0ef650bd0f820e922fcc42f1985d4621ae19cf upstream.
Section 9.7.7.2.5 of the 1.3 IBTA spec clearly says that receive
credits should never apply to RDMA write.
qib and hfi1 were doing that. The following situation will result
in a QP hang:
- A prior SEND or RDMA\_WRITE with immmediate consumed the last
credit for a QP using RC receive buffer credits
- The prior op is acked so there are no more acks
- The peer ULP fails to post receive for some reason
- An RDMA write sees that the credits are exhausted and waits
- The peer ULP posts receive buffers
- The ULP posts a send or RDMA write that will be hung
The fix is to avoid the credit test for the RDMA write operation.

orangefs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
commit b5accbb0dfae36d8d36cd882096943c98d5ede15 upstream.
When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
Fix the problem by creating \_\_orangefs\_set\_acl() function that does not
call posix\_acl\_update\_mode() and use it when inheriting ACLs. That
prevents SGID bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by
posix\_acl\_create() anyway.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

scsi: sg: fixup infoleak when using SG\_GET\_REQUEST\_TABLE

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/3e0097499839e0fe3af380410eababe5a47c4cf9)

```
When calling SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE ioctl only a half-filled table is
returned; the remaining part will then contain stale kernel memory
information.  This patch zeroes out the entire table to avoid this
issue.
