| * EXOS versions 16.x / 21.x / 22.x |
| --- |

### Impact Details

| **CVE-2017-14327** **Impact**: Information disclosure **Attack Vector**: local **Affected Platforms**: EXOS 16.x / 21.x / 22.x **CVS base score**: 4.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N **Description**: An authenticated user with admin privileges can get read access to any file on the filesystem. **Detail**: By obtaining an interactive shell with admin privileges as defined in CVE-2017-14331 (below), it is possible to access system files owned by root and without world read-access.   **CVE-2017-14329** **Impact**: Privilege Escalation (root interactive shell) **Attack Vector**: local **Affected Platforms**: EXOS 16.x / 21.x / 22.x **CVS base score**: 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) **Description**: An authenticated user with admin privileges can get an interactive root shell on the platform.  **Detail**: By compounding on CVE-2017-1427 and CVE-2017-14331, one can escalate to root by spawning a new exsh shell in debug mode and invoking an interactive shell with root privileges. **CVE-2017-14330** **Impact**: Privilege Escalation (root interactive shell) **Attack Vector**: local **Affected Platforms**: EXOS 16.x / 21.x / 22.x **CVS base score**: 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) **Description**: An authenticated user with admin privileges can get an interactive root shell on the platform. **Detail**: It is possible to get an interactive root shell on the platform by creating a process that will run with elevated privileges.  **CVE-2017-14331** **Impact**: Escape from exsh restricted shell **Attack Vector**: local **Affected Platforms**: EXOS 16.x / 21.x / 22.x **CVS base score**: 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  **Description**: An authenticated user with admin privileges can spawn an interactive shell on the system. **Detail**: A user with admin privileges on the switch can invoke an interactive shell with access to the underlying operating system. |

### Repair Recommendations

| Each of the CVEs described in this Vulnerability Notice rely upon the ability of an authenticated user with admin privileges to execute scripts to initiate the specific actions defined. As such, mitigation of these issues will be achieved by disallowing scripting when the OS is used in FIPS mode in an upcoming release.The following EXOS releases are expected to include this change to FIPS mode behavior:  * EXOS 16.2.4.5 (Available now) * EXOS 21.1.4.4-patch1-3 (Available now) * EXOS 22.3.1.4-patch1-4 (Available now) * EXOS 22.4.1 (Available now)  The fix is documented under CR xos0069140. |
