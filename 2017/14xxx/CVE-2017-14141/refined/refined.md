Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the usage of the `unserialize()` function on user-controlled data without proper sanitization or validation within the Kaltura platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via `unserialize()` (Cookie Data):**
    *   A hardcoded cookie secret `y3tAno3therS$cr3T` allows attackers to forge valid 'userzone' cookies.
    *   The cookie's serialized data is then passed to `unserialize()`, which can execute arbitrary PHP code through a crafted payload.
    *   This exploit can be triggered by calling the `getAllEntriesAction` with a valid entry ID.

2.  **Authenticated Remote Code Execution via `unserialize()` (Admin Panel):**
    *   The admin panel's 'wiki\_decode' function in 'Developer System Helper' passes user-provided input to `unserialize()` after a basic encoding.
    *   This allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code using a maliciously crafted serialized object.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present due to the insufficient use of PHP's `strip_tags()` to sanitize user input.
    *   Vulnerable locations include API paths where user-controlled parameters are passed without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated RCE:** Attackers can forge 'userzone' cookies and send malicious payloads to the server without authentication.
*   **Authenticated RCE:** Attackers must be authenticated to the admin panel to use the 'wiki\_decode' function.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript via vulnerable parameters in HTTP GET requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated RCE:** No prior authentication is needed; an attacker only needs to craft a malicious cookie payload and identify a public video entry ID.
*  **Authenticated RCE:** Requires valid administrator credentials
*   **XSS:** An attacker needs to identify vulnerable parameters to inject malicious scripts via HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities were fixed in Kaltura 13.2.0.
*   The provided GitHub commit shows the removal of the vulnerable `unserialize` calls.
*   The hardcoded cookie secret is a major weakness.

In summary, CVE-2017-14141 describes critical vulnerabilities in Kaltura that allow for unauthenticated and authenticated RCE, along with multiple XSS vulnerabilities due to unsafe use of `unserialize()` and insufficient input sanitization.
