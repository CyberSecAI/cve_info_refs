  "CVE-2017-14140": {
    "description": "The `move_pages()` system call in `mm/migrate.c` in the Linux kernel before 4.12.9 doesn't check the effective uid of the target process, enabling a local attacker to learn the memory layout of a setuid executable despite ASLR.",
    "root_cause": "The `move_pages()` system call did not adequately check the effective UID of the target process before moving pages, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass ASLR.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission check",
      "Insufficient validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could learn the memory layout of a setuid executable, effectively mitigating Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the vulnerable system",
      "Use of the `move_pages()` system call"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access and the ability to invoke system calls.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability existed because `move_pages()` used the same permission checks as for sending a signal, except it used `CAP_SYS_NICE` instead of `CAP_SYS_KILL`. While the system call moves physical pages and requires specific capabilities, the return value could be used to learn virtual address choices, breaking ASLR for binaries that share the same UID. The fix changes the permission checks to `ptrace_may_access()`, tightening the access checks for UIDs and effectively changing the capability check from `CAP_SYS_NICE` to `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`."

   "CVE-2017-9725": {
    "description": "A flaw was found where the kernel truncated the value used to indicate the size of a buffer which it would later become zero using an untruncated value. This can corrupt memory outside of the original allocation.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect type conversion during DMA memory allocation leading to a size truncation when allocating memory, while the clearing operation used the original, non-truncated, value.",
     "weaknesses":[
       "Incorrect casting",
       "Type conversion vulnerability",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption, potentially allowing for privilege escalation due to memory being cleared outside of the allocated buffer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the vulnerable system",
         "DMA memory allocation"
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires local access to trigger DMA memory allocation.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when a memory buffer is allocated and then cleared. Due to an incorrect type conversion, the size parameter used in the allocation is truncated. However, the clearing operation uses the original, non-truncated, size which leads to memory being cleared beyond the boundaries of the intended buffer. It is noted that the size parameter was not directly controllable, meaning that this vulnerability was only indirectly exploitable by manipulating other factors which influenced memory allocation."
