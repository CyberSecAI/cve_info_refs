Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-14494:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an information leak vulnerability in the DHCPv6 relay code of dnsmasq. A crafted DHCPv6 packet can cause dnsmasq to forward memory from outside the packet buffer when acting as a relay.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of sensitive memory content from the dnsmasq process. Specifically, data outside the intended packet buffer can be leaked to a DHCPv6 server when dnsmasq acts as a relay.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information residing in the memory space of the dnsmasq process. This could include data related to other processes, configurations, or potentially even other users' data, depending on the context and specific memory content being leaked. It could also potentially be used to aid in bypassing mitigations like ASLR.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the network by sending crafted DHCPv6 packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the local network and be able to send crafted DHCPv6 packets to a vulnerable dnsmasq instance.
*   The attacker must be able to trigger the DHCPv6 relay functionality of dnsmasq.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in dnsmasq versions prior to 2.78.
*   The flaw is located in the DHCPv6 relay code, implying that dnsmasq needs to be configured as a relay for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana, Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes from the Google Security Team.
*   Patches have been released to address this vulnerability with version 2.78 of dnsmasq.
*   Some distributions and products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, SUSE and Ubuntu were affected and provided fixes for this vulnerability.
