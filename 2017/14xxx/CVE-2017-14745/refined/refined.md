The content is related to CVE-2017-14745.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an integer overflow in `elf64-x86-64.c` within the `elf_x86_64_get_synthetic_symtab` function.
- The `bfd_canonicalize_dynamic_reloc` function can return -1 on error.
- This return value was not properly checked, and the negative value is assigned to `dynrelcount`.
- The `dynrelcount` variable which is signed is then used as the number of elements to sort in `qsort`. Since `qsort` expects a unsigned integer, this resulted in `qsort` using a huge number, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow due to the lack of error checking of the return value from `bfd_canonicalize_dynamic_reloc` and type mismatch when passing parameters to `qsort`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault and crash of `objdump` when processing a crafted ELF file.
- Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a maliciously crafted ELF file with `objdump`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify an ELF file.
- Ability to use `objdump` to process the crafted ELF file.
