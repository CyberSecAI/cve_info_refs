Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-14098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `pjsip_message_ip_updater` function in the `res_pjsip` channel driver of Asterisk.
- The function incorrectly assumes that URIs in the From, To, and Contact headers are always SIP URIs. It attempts to cast these headers' URIs to `pjsip_sip_uri *uri`.
- When a "tel" URI is present instead of a SIP URI, this type casting leads to a crash because the `other_param` member has different offsets in `pjsip_tel_uri` compared to `pjsip_sip_uri`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:**  The code doesn't properly handle different URI schemes (SIP vs tel) and attempts to access data at incorrect memory offsets.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation to verify the URI scheme before casting it to a specific type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted tel URI in a From, To, or Contact header causes Asterisk to crash. This makes the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted SIP message with a tel URI in a From, To, or Contact header.
- **Remote Unauthenticated Sessions:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to an Asterisk instance that has the vulnerable `res_pjsip` channel driver enabled.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed to trigger the crash.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Asterisk version 13.15.0.
- It affects Asterisk versions 13.x before 13.17.1 and 14.x before 14.6.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed by patching `pjsip_message_ip_updater` to properly handle "tel" URIs and ignore them if necessary.
- The issue is tracked as `ASTERISK-27152` in the Asterisk issue tracker.
