- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `sub_9d053904` function when parsing the "al" element of a JSON response from the PubNub service. Specifically, the `strcpy` function at [18] copies the value of "al" into the `insteon_pubnub.channel_al` buffer without checking the size, leading to a buffer overflow if the provided string is longer than the buffer's capacity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite parts of the `insteon_pubnub` structure by providing an overly long “al” parameter. This allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to impersonate the PubNub server and send a specially crafted JSON response with an overly long "al" value when the Insteon Hub makes an HTTPS GET request to retrieve channels and a key after a factory reset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and respond to the Insteon Hub's HTTPS GET request to the PubNub server, essentially performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
