Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-14956:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The AlienVault USM appliance's export functionality for compliance reports, specifically the `/ossim/report/wizard_email.php` endpoint, lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of the HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger the generation and sending of various compliance reports, potentially exposing sensitive internal data (including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO compliance information, as well as internal asset and alarm reports).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive compliance information, security events, logs, and asset inventories through crafted requests.
*   **Potential Compliance Violations:** Disclosure of such sensitive data may lead to violations of compliance regulations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can create a malicious web page or email containing a crafted form that submits a request to the vulnerable `wizard_email.php` endpoint. If an authenticated user visits this page or opens the email, their browser will automatically send a request to the server, triggering the export of the specified report to an email address controlled by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send a crafted email that the victim user would interact with.
*   **Victim Capabilities:** The victim must have an active, authenticated session with the AlienVault USM application and rights to access compliance reports.
*   **No direct access to the USM appliance required:** The attacker does not need to have direct access to the vulnerable system to launch the attack, as long as the victim can access it from their browser.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in AlienVault USM versions 5.4.2 and below.
*   The exploit uses a simple HTML form to submit a GET request with the parameters needed to trigger the export functionality.
*   The report name is passed as a base64 encoded parameter.
*   The attacker can request any of the 240+ pre-defined reports shipped with the product.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed after the vendor failed to respond to multiple contact attempts.
*   A fix was scheduled for version 5.4.3.
