Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-14055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing End-of-File (EOF) check within the `mv_read_header()` function in the `libavformat/mvdec.c` file of FFmpeg.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of EOF Check:** The core issue is the absence of a check for the end of the input file within a loop that processes frame data. This loop is based on a `nb_frames` field read from the file header.
- **Unbounded Loop:** If a crafted MV file declares a large `nb_frames` value but doesn't provide sufficient data, the loop will continue trying to read data from the file, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads and excessive resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service attack. The missing EOF check can lead to:
    - **High CPU consumption:** The loop will continue to execute, consuming CPU cycles unnecessarily.
    - **High memory consumption:** If data is being read from the input source, even if that is from empty data, this could still increase memory usage by the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted MV File:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MV file that exploits the missing EOF check. This file would typically contain a large `nb_frames` value in the header while having less actual data.
- **File Processing:** The attack is triggered when FFmpeg attempts to process this malicious MV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted MV file as input to a vulnerable version of FFmpeg. This could be through any mechanism where FFmpeg is used to decode the file.
