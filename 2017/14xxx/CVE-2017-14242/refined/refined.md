Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `don/list.php` file, specifically within the `statut` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`statut` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker might gain unauthorized access or control over the system.
- **Denial of Service:**  Malicious SQL queries could be injected to disrupt the application's operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `statut` parameter in the URL is the primary attack vector.
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL with SQL injection in the statut parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of Application Structure:** A basic understanding of the application's structure and how it handles URL parameters would be helpful to craft the SQL injection payload.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The commit message "FIX SQL injection on don/list.php parameter statut" clearly indicates the nature and location of the vulnerability.
- The comment "Discovered by ADLab of Venustech" suggests the vulnerability was found externally.
- The code changes in `htdocs/don/list.php` show a fix where the code now uses `IN` clause, which should prevent this SQL injection vulnerability by handling multiple values correctly in a safe way.

**Summary**
The provided content shows a SQL injection vulnerability in the `statut` parameter of the `don/list.php` file, which has been patched by the commit.
