- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free vulnerability in the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. Specifically, when a PDF document closes through javascript `this.closeDoc()`, some objects are freed. However, javascript execution continues, and subsequent calls to methods such as `this.search.query()` which hold stale references to freed memory result in the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain control of the instruction pointer (EIP), leading to the execution of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -   A specially crafted PDF document that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability.
    -   Visiting a malicious website if the browser plugin extension for Foxit Reader is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious site with the browser plugin enabled. The attacker also needs to have some knowledge of heap manipulation to achieve full control of the EIP.
