# Details

Word Press Product Bugs Report

Bug Name: XSS & CSRF in Crony Cronjob Manager Version 0.4.4

Software: Crony Cronjob Manager Version 0.4.4 (Wordpress - Plugin)

Version: 0.4.4

Last Updated: 17-03-2015

Homepage: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/crony/>

Compatible Up to Wordpress 4.3.0 Version (Requires: 3.6 or higher)

Severity High

# Proof of concept: (POC)

Visit the following page on a site with this plugin installed. <http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=crony&action=manage&do=create> and modify the value of **name** variable with `<script>alert(‘Vulnerable2CSRF&XSS’)</script>` payload and send the request to the server after generating CSRF request to the victim

Now, the added XSS payload will be executed on the victim machine and victim machine can be compromised.

**Note:** XSS payload has been tried with the application once after implementing Unfiltered Html Settings as defined to wp-config.php file.

***define( 'DISALLOW\_UNFILTERED\_HTML', true );***

**Issue 1:**

The POST Request of the variable **name** in the URL <http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=crony&action=manage&do=create> is vulnerable to XSS and the plugin is also exploitable using CSRF vulnerability. Whereas, explained in details with screenshots below.

[![before csrf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754108/8767a772-7cbb-11e5-9489-95970c8c990e.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754108/8767a772-7cbb-11e5-9489-95970c8c990e.png)

**Figure 1:** Cronjobs list before CSRF code & XSS Payload gets executed.

**Figure 3:** Capturing the HTTP request in intercept proxy

**Figure 4:** Created a crafted HTML page with XSS input and CSRF Request

**Note:** After creating the CSRFT HTML page the user logout and then again login in and then the HTML page is executed. In this case we have executed it from local machine.

[![csrf-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754117/94462db0-7cbb-11e5-8f62-565e3c0881c7.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754117/94462db0-7cbb-11e5-8f62-565e3c0881c7.png)

**Figure 5:** XSS Payload gets executed in the browser once the link sent by the attacker has been clicked.

[![csrf-4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754143/d30842cc-7cbb-11e5-84a7-d6e2f30ab358.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/10754143/d30842cc-7cbb-11e5-84a7-d6e2f30ab358.png)

**Figure 6:** XSS payload gets executed and a new cronjob is created.

---

**Reproducing Steps**

1. Logon into any wordpress application (attacker)
2. Click to “Add new cronjob” in Crony Cronjob Manager Version 0.4.4 Plugin and capture the request in intercepting proxy.
3. Now, Generate a CSRF Request with attacker logged in account.
4. Modify the request with the code you required to get executed in victim’s browser.
5. Enter the value for the **name** variable with “XSS&CSRF” and add any scripts, malicious code or payload.
6. Here, its `<script>alert(‘Vulnerable2CSRF&XSS’)</script>` which an attacker wants to get executed in victim’s browser and sends the link to victim.
7. Now, once the victim opens the link in the user logged in browser. Then, immediately the added XSS payload will be executed whenever we review it.

#### CVE

##### CVE-2017-14530

#### Securin ID

#### Status

#### Date

##### August 28, 2015

### Description

A cross-site request forgery vulnerability was identified on the WordPress plugin crony cronjob manager before 0.4.4.Â  The specific flaw exists via the name parameter in an action=manage&do=create operation requests because of failure to validate a CSRF token before handling a POST request.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

Visit the following page on a site with this plugin installed.

<http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wpadmin/admin.php?page=crony&action=manage&do=create> and modify the value of the name variable with<script>alert(âVulnerable2CSRF&XSSâ) </script> payload and send the request to the server after generating CSRF request to the victim. Now, the added XSS payload is executed on the victimâs system, which can be compromised.

Note: XSS payload tried with the application once after implementing unfiltered Html Settings as defined to the wp-config.php file.

define( ‘DISALLOW\_UNFILTERED\_HTML’, true );

Issue 1: The POST Request of the variable name in the URL <http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wpadmin/admin.php?page=crony&action=manage&do=create> is vulnerable to XSS, and the plugin is also exploitable using CSRF vulnerability.

**Note:** After creating the CSRFT HTML page, the user logs out, then again log in, and now, the HTML page is executed. In this case, we executed it from the local machine.

### Impact

An attacker can exploit this by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link, to allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.

### Remediations

Download the latest updated version from vendor advisory and update.

### Timeline

**Aug 28, 2015:** Discovered in Crony Cronjob Manager Version 0.4.4.
