The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14257. It describes multiple issues found in Bento4, including an exploitable write access violation and a non-exploitable memory violation.

**Exploitable Write Access Violation:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in `Ap4StscAtom.cpp`, specifically on line 95, when assigning a value to `m_Entries[i].m_SamplesPerChunk`. The issue is triggered by a malformed MP4 file that leads to incorrect array indexing within the `m_Entries` array. This is related to how the `SetItemCount` function in `AP4_Array<AP4_StscTableEntry>` works in conjunction with parsing an MP4 file. Specifically, the `m_Entries` array's size might be smaller than the `i` variable used to access an element, causing a write out of the boundary.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted MP4 file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.

**Non-Exploitable Memory Violation:**

*   **Root Cause:** The non-exploitable memory violation occurs in `Ap4StszAtom.cpp` on line 84. During an iteration in a loop using an index variable i, it is possible for a read to occur outside of the allocated memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of service, program crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted MP4 file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.
