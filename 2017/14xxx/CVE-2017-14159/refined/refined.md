    "info": "The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14159. Specifically, the OpenLDAP bug report 8703 which was assigned CVE-2017-14159, discusses the issue.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: \nThe slapd daemon creates its PID file after dropping privileges, resulting in the PID file being owned by an unprivileged user.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n\n- The PID file is writable by a non-root user.\n- Init scripts that are run as root may blindly trust the contents of the PID file.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n\n- A non-root user can replace the contents of the PID file with the PID of a root process.\n- Attempts to signal the PID in the file will signal a root process chosen by the non-root user.\n- This could lead to a denial-of-service if an init script kills an incorrect process by using the tampered PID file. The provided example is an attacker writing '1' into the pid file which would cause init to send signals to init.\n\nAttack vectors:\n\n- Compromise of the slapd daemon which runs as a non-root user, allows writing to the PID file. Then, an administrator runs a stop command on the service, causing the init script to kill another process.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n\n- The attacker must have the ability to write to the PID file which, in this case, would involve compromising the slapd daemon to have an open network shell running as the non-root user that owns the PID file.\n- The attacker must have the ability to cause the init script to try and stop the process using the PID file."
