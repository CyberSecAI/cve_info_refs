Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14425:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions "Local - revA and revB - Weak files permission and credentials stored in cleartext - CVE-2017-14424, CVE-2017-14425, CVE-2017-14426, CVE-2017-14427, CVE-2017-14428" which confirms it is related to this CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is weak file permissions and storing sensitive information in cleartext on the file system of the D-Link DIR-850L router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cleartext Passwords:** The following files store credentials in cleartext:
    *   `/var/passwd`: Contains the admin user credentials.
    *   `/var/etc/hnapasswd`: Contains the admin user credentials.
    *  `/var/run/storage_account_root`: Contains storage account credentials.
    *   `/var/run/hostapd*`: Contains the wireless passphrase.
2.  **Weak File Permissions:** The following files have world-readable or world-writable permissions:
    *   `/var/passwd` (666): World-writable.
    *   `/var/etc/hnapasswd` (666): World-writable.
    *   `/var/run/storage_account_root` (666): World-writable.
    *   `/var/run/hostapd*` (666): World-writable
    *   `/etc/shadow` is a symlink to `/var/etc/passwd`, which is world readable.
    *   `/var/etc/shadow` is world-readable, containing a DES hash of the admin user's password

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker with local access to the router can:

*   Obtain the administrator's password in cleartext, allowing full control over the device through the web interface.
*   Retrieve wireless passphrases, allowing access to the wireless networks.
*   Potentially gain access to storage accounts based on the credentials found in `/var/run/storage_account_root`.
*   Retrieve the DES hash of the admin password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access to the router's file system. This could be achieved by:
    *   Gaining shell access via other vulnerabilities, such as the backdoor access (CVE-2017-14421) or the Pre-Auth RCE (CVE-2017-14429).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have some form of local access to the router's filesystem or a shell.
* No special privileges are needed after achieving access to the router's file system, due to the weak file permissions.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**
*   The document lists specific files, their exact permissions, and the type of information stored in them.
* It provides the specific passwords being stored for one of the files, as an example
*   It clarifies that the `/etc/shadow` file contains a DES hash and not a cleartext password, but the file it symlinks to, `/var/etc/shadow` is world-readable.
*   The document details that even the wireless passphrases are stored in world-readable files within the `/var/run/` directory
