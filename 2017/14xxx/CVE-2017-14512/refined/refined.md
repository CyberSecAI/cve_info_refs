- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unfiltered user input in the `$_POST['sort']` parameter within the `forummanage.php` file. Specifically, the `sort` parameter is directly included in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization before constructing the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `sort` parameter, allowing them to perform actions such as retrieving database information, potentially modifying or deleting data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `forummanage.php` with the `action` parameter set to `editforum` and a crafted `sort` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application, which is usually accessible over the network.
