# CVE-2017-14100

| **Name** | CVE-2017-14100 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command execution is possible. The app\_minivm module has an "externnotify" program configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection. |

| Description: | the commit https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/80b8c2349c427a94a428670f1183bdc693936813 has made asterisk vulnerable again for RTP/RTCP scanning/stealing/injection attacks (when NAT support is enabled). Version 11.0.4 was the first release to include this, all following versions have this issue (last tested against 14.4.0).   How to reproduce:  - set up a SIP friend with NAT support enabled  - make a call with that SIP peer (i use a minimalistic Playback extension)  - use rtpnatscan from a remote system (https://github.com/kapejod/rtpnatscan) to scan Asterisk's RTP port range (rtpnatscan will report received RTP packets "received X bytes from target port Y, seq Z")   Impact:  - denial of service (with minimal bandwidth requirements)  - information leakage   This is what Sandro Gauci has been talking about in his presentation at Kamailio World 2017. | | |

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2017-005

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Media takeover in RTP stack |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Unauthorized data disclosure |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Critical |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | May 17, 2017 |
| **Reported By** | Klaus-Peter Junghanns |
| **Posted On** | August 31, 2017 |
| **Last Updated On** | August 31, 2017 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2017-14099 |

| **Description** | The âstrictrtpâ option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above.    The ânatâ and ârtp\_symmetricâ options for chan\_sip and chan\_pjsip respectively enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by default but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT.    A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected the new code allowed a new source address to be learned at all times.    If a flood of RTP traffic was received the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media and with symmetric RTP enabled outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker continued to send traffic they would continue to receive traffic as well. |

| **Resolution** | The RTP stack will now only learn a new source address if it has been told to expect the address to change. The RTCP support has now also been updated to drop RTCP reports that are not regarding the RTP session currently in progress. The strict RTP learning progress has also been improved to guard against a flood of RTP packets attempting to take over the media stream. |

         CVE Name

    Description  The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the
                 RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a
                 session and drops any packets that do not originate from
                 the expected address. This option is enabled by default in
                 Asterisk 11 and above.

                 The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric" options for chan_sip and
                 chan_pjsip respectively enable symmetric RTP support in the
                 RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media
                 as the target address of any sent media. This option is not
                 enabled by default but is commonly enabled to handle
                 devices behind NAT.

                 A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP
                 stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs.
                 When combined with the symmetric RTP support this
                 introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead
                 of only learning a new address when expected the new code
                 allowed a new source address to be learned at all times.

                 If a flood of RTP traffic was received the strict RTP
                 support would allow the new address to provide media and
                 with symmetric RTP enabled outgoing traffic would be sent
                 to this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked.
                 Provided the attacker continued to send traffic they would
                 continue to receive traffic as well.

    Resolution  The RTP stack will now only learn a new source address if it
                has been told to expect the address to change. The RTCP

# The RTP bleed Bug

The RTP bleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in a number of RTP proxies. This weakness allows malicious users to inject and receive RTP streams of ongoing calls **without** needing to be positioned as man-in-the-middle. This may lead to eavesdropping of audio calls, impersonation and possibly cause toll fraud by redirecting ongoing calls.

![](sipvicious-rtpbleed.png)
## How does the vulnerability work?

RTP proxies try to address NAT limitations affecting RTC systems by proxying RTP streams between two or more parties. When NAT is in place, the RTP proxy software often cannot rely on the RTP IP and port information retrieved through signalling (e.g. SIP). Therefore, a number of RTP proxies have implemented a mechanism where such IP and port tuplet is learned automatically. This is often done by by inspecting incoming RTP traffic and marking the source IP and port for any incoming RTP traffic as the one that should be responded to. This mechanism, which may be called "learning mode", does not make use of any sort of authentication. Therefore attackers may send RTP traffic to the RTP proxy and receive the proxied RTP traffic meant to be for the caller or callee of an ongoing RTP stream. We call this vulnerability RTP Bleed because it allows attackers to receive RTP media streams meant to be sent to legitimate users.

Another interesting behaviour of RTP proxies and RTP stacks is that sometimes, even if not vulnerable to RTP Bleed, they will accept, forward and/or process RTP packets from any source. Therefore attackers can send RTP packets which may allow them to inject their media instead of the legitimate one. We call this attack RTP injection because it allows injection of illegitimate RTP packets into existent RTP streams. This vulnerability may be found in both RTP proxies and endpoints.

Both attacks require sending of RTP packets to a port allocated by the RTP proxy for legitimate RTP sessions. In the case of RTP Bleed, however, this leads to the attacker receiving the RTP packets that are being proxied. This can therefore lead to leakage of confidential media, insertion of wrong media and denial of service. On successful exploitation, the attacker can convert the RTP stream into its media equivalent and, for example, listen in on an ongoing phone call or save the audio to disk.

## What leaks in practice?

We have seen RTP proxies leak RTP packets containing unencrypted audio and allow audio injection of ongoing calls. We have also seen encrypted RTP (i.e. SRTP) packets being leaked out, which has different security implications to when RTP is not encrypted. We assume that any RTP traffic passing through a vulnerable RTP proxy may be sent to an attacker who has network access to the system.

## Q&A

### Why it is called the RTP bleed Bug?

The naming convention follows a number of other security vulnerabilities, first being Heartbleed, suffixed with the keyword *bleed*. Also, our imagination when naming this vulnerability, was rather limited.

When this vulnerability is exploited it leads to the leakage of RTP packets which are sent to the attacker instead of the legitimate caller or callee.

### Is this a design flaw in RTP protocol specification?

Sort of, a bit. There is no authentication of RTP packets in unencrypted RTP session. Even when NAT is not involved the source of the packets cannot be known (except if symmetric RTP (RFC4961) is used by both endpoints).

However, poorly designed RTP proxies make exploiting this flaw easier than necessary when trying to cater for endpoints behind NAT.

### Is this like Heartbleed but for RTP?

No. While Heartbleed leaked memory due to a bug in OpenSSL, RTP Bleed leaks RTP packets due to a design issue in vulnerable systems.

### How is this different to sniffing unencrypted RTP traffic?

To sniff unencrypted RTP traffic, an attacker usually needs to be strategically positioned within the target network. Examples of strategically positioned attackers include those that can successfully mount an ARP cache poisoning attack, abuse compromised routers or perform BGP hijacking.

RTP Bleed **does not** require the attacker to be strategically positioned within the target network. All that is required is for the attacker to send RTP packets to the vulnerable system.

### What is being leaked?

RTP packets which usually contain audio or video payloads. The implication is that phone call audio may be leaked or hijacked by an attacker.

### Am I affected by the bug?

You may be affected either directly (e.g. if you are a RTC vendor or service provider) or indirectly. The RTP protocol and media gateways are used in various telephony systems, including PBX systems, "landline phones" connected to customer premises equipment, smart phone apps and so on.

### How widespread is this?

The most notable software vulnerable to this bug is Asterisk and RTP Proxy. We do expect a number of commercial as well as custom RTP proxies to be vulnerable to this bug.

### What software is known to be affected?

The following software was tested and found to be vulnerable:

* Asterisk 14.4.0
* RTPproxy (tested 1.2.1-2ubuntu1 and RTPproxy 2.2.alpha.20160822 (git))

### Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?

Exploitation of this bug often does leave clear traces including phone calls going mute and choppy audio.

### Can IDS/IPS detect or block this attack?

It is likely that UDP port scan detection can be used to detect and mitigate attack. This does not, however, address the vulnerability itself and should only be seen as temporary mitigation.

### Has this been abused in the wild?

We don't know but during our testing, we did find vulnerable systems on the Internet.

### How does this vulnerability lead to Denial of Service?

Normally, the vulnerable RTP proxy will proxy the same RTP stream to only one IP and port tuple. This means that when the attacker starts receiving the RTP stream, the original legitimate caller stops receiving the RTP stream.

An attacker who simply floods an RTP proxy with RTP packets can cause all RTP streams to be sent to the attacker. Therefore legitimate users are denied service and will be unable to get their calls through the system.

### Does this vulnerability always lead to Denial of Service?

No, in our experience, we have seen vulnerable systems that will send some of the packets to the attacker and some to the legitimate user. When this happens, the audio quality may appear to be *choppy* but the call may carry on.

This happens when the vulnerable system sends RTP to the IP address and port that last sent valid RTP. Therefore this leads to a constant race condition between the victim and the attacker.

### Does SRTP mitigate this?

If incoming SRTP is validated by the proxy, then SRTP would mitigate the security issue. We have seen dumb RTP proxies that simply forward SRTP and in this case SRTP could be leaked.

### What are the security implications of leaking SRTP?

If a vulnerable system is leaking SRTP, the confidentiality or integrity of the SRTP packets is not compromised. However this may lead to denial of service which is still a major security issue for real-time communications systems.

### What is the recommended solution?

It is recommended to make use of SRTP to avoid the confidentiality and integrity impact of this vulnerability. SRTP should ideally be between two endpoints without any proxy in the middle. Authenticated STUN could help introduce some form of authentication to RTP.

### What about having a learning mode or probation period?

Learning mode or probation period is when the choice of IP and port to relay RTP to is limited to a certain amount of time or packets. RTP proxies that we have tested did implement this feature to try to prevent attackers from the attack that we describe. However, what this feature does in terms of security is to limit the exposure to this attack to a short period of time. In practice, we think that this is an insufficient solution because attacker may continuously *spray* the vulnerable server with RTP packets. This allows the attacker to send RTP within those first few packets and still exploit this vulnerability.

### Any other solutions or mitigation?

RTP proxies could match the IP of incoming RTP packets to those hinted through signalling during an initial learning phase. If multiple IPs are seen during this phase, priority should be given to the previously hinted IPs. This behaviour may be repeated whenever the call gets transferred, put on hold or resumed.

Valid IPs could be hinted within SIP as well as by looking at the IP header of the signalling network traffic.

This mitigation does not address all cases where the signalling and media are using separate systems. It can, however, be combined with other solutions (such as using static IPs, supporting ICE and STUN authentication etc), to reduce the exposure to this attack.

### Is there a bright side to all this?

Service providers who may be affected may take this as a good opportunity to test their systems and take a hard look at their RTP proxies that are often forgotten from a security standpoint.

### What can be done to prevent this from happening in future?

The security, VoIP and RTC, community, we included, must learn to find these inevitable human mistakes sooner. Please support the development effort of software you trust your privacy to.

WebRTC avoids this particular security bug, and various others, by mandating the usage of SRTP, making use of authenticated STUN and supporting TURN whenever proxying is needed.

### So is WebRTC also vulnerable?

Usually not.

### Who found the RTP bleed Bug?

This bug was independently discovered by Klaus-Peter Junghanns and Sandro Gauci of Enable Security. Klaus-Peter found this vulnerability while implementing his own RTP stack while Sandro Gauci came across it while security testing media gateways for Enable Security's clients.

# CVE-2017-14099

| **Name** | CVE-2017-14099 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In res/res\_rtp\_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized data disclosure (media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and "rtp\_symmetric" options (for chan\_sip and chan\_pjsip, respectively) enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support, this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a new source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received, the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media, and (with symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked.
