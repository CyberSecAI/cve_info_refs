Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way Asterisk's RTP stack handles source address learning when the `strictrtp`, `nat`, and `rtp_symmetric` options are enabled. A change to improve tolerance for late media during reinvites introduced a flaw: the system would learn a new source address for RTP traffic at any time, instead of only when an address change was expected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Source Address Learning:** The `strictrtp` option, designed to drop packets from unexpected sources, could be bypassed. The RTP stack would learn a new source address even when it shouldn't.
-   **Symmetric RTP Misuse:** When combined with symmetric RTP options (`nat` and `rtp_symmetric`), the system would send outgoing media to the attacker-controlled address after a new source is learned. This behavior allows an attacker to hijack media streams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Data Disclosure (Media Hijacking):** Attackers can intercept and receive the RTP media stream intended for legitimate users, resulting in eavesdropping on audio and potentially video calls.
-   **Denial of Service:** By flooding the system with RTP packets, an attacker could cause all RTP streams to be redirected to their address, denying service to legitimate users.
-  **Media Injection:** An attacker can inject their own media into the call, impersonating a party.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote Attack:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the Asterisk server.
-   **RTP Packet Injection:** The attacker needs to send RTP traffic to a port allocated by Asterisk for a legitimate RTP session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send UDP packets to the Asterisk server's RTP port range.
-   **Timing:** Successful exploitation requires sending a sufficient flood of RTP traffic to trigger the learning of the attacker's address.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is referred to as "RTP bleed" because it allows an attacker to receive RTP media streams meant for legitimate users.
- The vulnerability can lead to toll fraud by redirecting ongoing calls.
- The vulnerability affects Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1, and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5.
- This issue is not a design flaw in RTP but a flaw in how specific RTP proxies handle the protocol.
- SRTP, if properly validated by the proxy, would mitigate this issue.
- WebRTC is not vulnerable due to mandated use of SRTP and authenticated STUN.
