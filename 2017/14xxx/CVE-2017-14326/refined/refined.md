{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in the `ReadMATImage` function within the `coders/mat.c` file of the ImageMagick library. Specifically, when processing malformed MAT files (MATLAB files), the function allocates memory for image data and other structures but fails to free it in certain error handling paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak",
      "Improper error handling",
      "Lack of resource cleanup"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by repeatedly submitting a malicious MAT file that triggers the memory leak. This could lead to the exhaustion of available memory, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. It's also possible that this could be a prerequisite for code execution in certain contexts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious file upload",
       "Processing of crafted image files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted `.mat` file to be processed by ImageMagick."
  },
  "additional_details": {
   "affected_versions": "ImageMagick 7.0.7-1 Q16 x86_64 and potentially earlier versions.",
   "attack_scenario": "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `convert` command of ImageMagick with a crafted `.mat` file as input.",
   "leaked_memory_details": "The report shows direct and indirect memory leaks totalling 13239 bytes. The leaks occur during the processing of a malformed MAT file at `coders/mat.c:962`"
  }
