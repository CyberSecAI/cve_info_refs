The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14966.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the inputted output buffer address (Irp->UserBuffer) being saved on the stack and later used without being validated when using as an argument.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary Write vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary write capabilities, leading to potential privilege escalation or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted IOCTL request (0x830000c0) to the vulnerable driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the output buffer address (Irp->UserBuffer).
