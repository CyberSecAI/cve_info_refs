| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2016-12-22 01:31:45 UTC  ``` The init script for gimps calls "chown -R" on /var/lib/gimps every time you start it:    checkconfig() {       ...       /bin/chown -R ${USER}:${GROUP} ${GIMPS_DIR}  The GIMPS user can place a hard link in that directory to any path he chooses (on the same filesystem), and trick root into giving ownership of that file to him. For example, on my machine, GIMPS is running as nobody:nobody. If I replace /var/lib/gimps/local.txt with a hardlink to /var/lib/portage/world and then start gimps, the "nobody" user gains control of it:    $ sudo su nobody -c 'ln /var/lib/portage/world /var/lib/gimps/local.txt'   $ sudo /etc/init.d/gimps start    * Starting GIMPS ...   $ ls /var/lib/portage/world   -rw-r--r-- 2 nobody nobody 3.7K 2016-12-21 16:10 /var/lib/portage/world  Our gentoo-sources have a patch that prevents this, but vanilla-sources do not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Kahle (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-12-22 05:56:45 UTC  ``` I'm adding Paolo Pedroni as I'm sort of a proxy maintainer here.

I've always thought it was there to allow the user under which we choose to run the program to view and edit files in the folder. If there's a better way, please go ahead and fix it. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-12-22 10:15:39 UTC  ``` Adding [bug 540006](show_bug.cgi?id=540006 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Auditing] sys-apps/openrc: checkpath: {hard,symbolic} link as possible attack vector to gain privilege escalation") to see-also as it is referenced in report re attack mitigation (It was here the protect in gentoo-sources was added) as well as changes done to checkpath to mitigate this.

So while this line,    checkpath -f -o ${USER}:${GROUP} ${GIMPS_DIR}/*  is probably safe, I have to wonder if it's necessary. Once the GIMPS user/group owns $GIMPS_DIR, the only people who can create files in it are root and the GIMPS user. If root creates a file in there, then you don't want to change its ownership, and if the GIMPS user does, it will already have the correct ownership.  I think we could get away with the single call to "checkpath -d"... now all we need is someone who actually runs GIMPS on OpenRC to try it =) ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2016-12-22 13:09:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Orlitzky from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=603408#c7)) >  > So while this line, >  >   checkpath -f -o ${USER}:${GROUP} ${GIMPS_DIR}/* >  > is probably safe,  Since that wildcard will catch directories, too, the init script may spit out some errors complaining that you're calling "checkpath -f" on a directory.

Since tomka is apparently on devaway, will you accept a patch (or a github PR) with all other proposed changes from me? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2016-12-22 13:23:15 UTC  ``` Yeah, sure.

To check: 1) emerge the modified package (doh!) 2) Before starting the service run (so it will create some files in /var/lib/gimps, among which /var/lib/gimps/local.txt, whose existance is checked in the init script):    # /opt/gimps/mprime -m -w/var/lib/gimps 3) Answer 'N' to the "Join Gimps?" question 4) Press enter a few times to accept default values until the stress test starts 5) Stop the stress test with ^C 6) Exit the client, pressing '5' 7) The files in /var/lib/gimps now have the uid and gid of the user under which you run the stress test. Chown them to nobody:nobody or change /etc/conf.d/gimps accordingly (see why the init script happily 'chown'ed the folder and all its contents?) 8) Try to run the init script ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2016-12-23 14:26:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paolo Pedroni from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=603408#c11)) > Created [attachment 457286](attachment.cgi?id=457286 "0001-sci-mathematics-gimps-Fix-potential-privilege-escala.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=457286&action=edit "0001-sci-mathematics-gimps-Fix-potential-privilege-escala.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=457286&action=diff "0001-sci-mathematics-gimps-Fix-potential-privilege-escala.patch")] [details, diff] > 0001-sci-mathematics-gimps-Fix-potential-privilege-escala.patch >  > This is a patch with the intended fix. >   Thanks! Can you also do a revision bump of the 28.10 version?  The way this usually goes is that the security team will fast-track the stabilization of your new (fixed) revision, and then we can remove v28.9 from the tree. The new stable revision will force everyone to upgrade, ensuring that they pull down the fixed init script.  (We're not supposed to modify stable ebuilds, but it's kind of a moot point if we're going to get rid of it ASAP.) ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Paolo Pedroni    2016-12-23 15:05:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 457290](attachment.cgi?id=457290 "0002-sci-mathematics-gimps-revbump-for-new-version.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=457290&action=edit "0002-sci-mathematics-gimps-revbump-for-new-version.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=457290&action=diff "0002-sci-mathematics-gimps-revbump-for-new-version.patch")] 0002-sci-mathematics-gimps-revbump-for-new-version.patch  Revbump for new version. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2016-12-23 16:11:52 UTC  ``` Thanks again, I just pushed those two commits so that we can get the stabilization process rolling.  I don't like adding another step (the chown) to the manual configuration, but some of it seems unavoidable. Am I correct that users have to run mprime at least once to generate their local.txt?  If so, it might make sense to document all of that in a special gentoo README file (a la readme.gentoo-r1.eclass) or on the wiki (which could be mentioned in an einfo message).  Here's my totally untested idea.  1. Always run the daemon as a new user, "gimps". That's safer than reusing "nobody", and changing $USER/$GROUP in the conf.d file doesn't work anyway, because the file ownership is wrong after you do it.  2. Create /var/lib/gimps as gimps:gimps in the ebuild.  3. After installation, instruct users what to do, if they want to run the daemon:      3a. Give the "gimps" user a shell temporarily.     3b. Run "/opt/gimps/mprime -m -w/var/lib/gimps" once **as the gimps user**        to generate local.txt, and use Ctrl-C to kill it.     3c. Make /sbin/nologin the shell for "gimps" again, and lock the        account with "passwd -l".  4. You can remove the call to checkpath in the init script, and use "gimps" instead of $USER/$GROUP. I guess $GIMPS_DIR should be fixed at /var/lib/gimps, too.  That way you never have to run mprime as root, and root never tries to change ownership or permissions on anything. Users still have to do some manual steps, but everything except the shell juggling and account locking is already necessary. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Paolo Pedroni    2017-01-04 12:26:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Orlitzky from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=603408#c14)) > Thanks again, I just pushed those two commits so that we can get the > stabilization process rolling.

I'd rather not remove the option of changing user:group for gimps, there are use cases for which it may be necessary. I especially don't like to remove the option of changing $GIMPS_DIR: dual boot users need to change that to put gimps file in a folder readable by Windows.  Of course the final decision lies with tomka as the official mantainer. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Thomas Kahle (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-01-04 14:05:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paolo Pedroni from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=603408#c15)) > I will work on it (if tomka does not beat me to it).

Thanks.  > @Security: This is done, we can proceed with stabilization on amd64 and x86, > target =sci-mathematics/gimps-28.10-r1.  =sci-mathematics/gimps-28.10-r1 is stable on all archs (see [bug #612926](show_bug.cgi?id=612926 "RESOLVED FIXED - sci-mathematics/gimps-28.10-r1 stabilization")).  Old versions should be removed. Can someone in sci-mathematics@g.o do it, please?

As issue is fixed in stable I'm removing the group restriction for this issue.  We need to request a CVE and produce a GLSA containing said CVE.  @maintainer: In which version was the affected init script added. I take it this is a Gentoo-specific issue and the init script is not included upstream? ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Paolo Pedroni    2017-08-18 13:57:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kristian Fiskerstrand from [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=603408#c24)) > @maintainer: In which version was the affected init script added.

You are correct this is a Gentoo-specific issue. ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2017-09-10 06:40:34 UTC  ``` New GLSA Request filed. ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2017-09-15 01:40:00 UTC  ``` CVE requested.
