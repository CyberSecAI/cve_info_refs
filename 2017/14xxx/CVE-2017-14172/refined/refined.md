{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ReadPSImage()` function within `coders/ps.c`, specifically around how Photoshop profiles within PS files are processed. A crafted PS image file can declare a large `length` for a profile without providing enough backing data. The code then enters a loop based on the declared `length` without checking for EOF, which results in excessive CPU and memory consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient data validation leading to uncontrolled loop execution",
        "Lack of EOF check during profile data processing",
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU and memory consumption. This can lead to the process becoming unresponsive and potentially crashing the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By processing a crafted PS image file with a declared large profile length but insufficient backing data"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user or automated system to process the malicious PS file. The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position and no code execution is mentioned in the provided context."
