{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper access control in the data, program, and function file permissions of Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLCs allows unauthenticated users to perform read/write operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The PLC firmware does not properly restrict access to various files containing sensitive information and configuration settings. This lack of authentication allows an attacker to read and write to these files using CIP encapsulated PCCC commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger the PLC to load its program from EEPROM on error, which is part of a larger exploit to flash custom firmware. This also allows for the modification of ladder logic, modification of network settings, and triggering of device faults.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted, unauthenticated packets containing CIP encapsulated PCCC commands to the PLC. The commands can target specific files to read or write data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the PLC and must be able to send specially crafted packets using the CIP protocol. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
