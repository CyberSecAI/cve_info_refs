Vulnerability Details:
=====================
When logging into the subscriber account the "TransitMaster" application makes a HTTP POST request with
the subscriber's unique ID (In this case is a four digit number) to the backend database and retrieves the
account information - email / encrypted password. Manipulating this HTTP POST request's subscriber ID number
by an individual number will retrieve account details for other subscribers of the service. This
request can be performed unauthenticated - only requiring knowledge of the specific HTTP request.
