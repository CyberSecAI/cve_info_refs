- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization of the file name. Specifically, the `getClientOriginalName()` method is used to save the file with its original name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious scripts (e.g., PHP), to the server. This could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can upload a file through the "profile change" and "cover change" functionalities by sending a POST request with a crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user (Job Seeker or Employer) to access the profile change or cover change functionalities.
