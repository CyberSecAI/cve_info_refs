Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and encoding of plugin and template names when displayed in the admin area of WordPress. Specifically, the issue arises from missing URL encoding in several places where plugin and template file paths are used in URLs. Additionally, there's a lack of HTML escaping in template names displayed in dropdowns.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of template and plugin names. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the admin interface.
*   **Missing URL encoding**: The lack of URL encoding of plugin and template file names in URLs allows for the injection of special characters that can break the URL or lead to other unexpected behaviors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of an administrator's browser session.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take control of an administrator's account.
*   **Data Modification/Theft:** An attacker may be able to modify or steal data visible within the admin interface.
*   **Redirection**: By exploiting the open redirect issue in conjunction with the missing sanitization, attackers may be able to redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugin/Theme Names:** An attacker could craft a plugin or theme with a malicious name containing XSS payloads.
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially craft malicious URLs containing special characters or XSS payloads, targeting the affected admin pages and parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access (Indirect):**  While the attacker may not need direct admin access initially, they would likely need to have a plugin or theme with a malicious name installed on the WordPress site by another admin user. Alternatively, they would need knowledge of a valid admin URL and the ability to craft malicious URLs for that site.
*   **Social Engineering (Potentially):** Social engineering may be required to trick an administrator into installing a malicious plugin or theme.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves adding `urlencode()` to the plugin file names when constructing URLs, and using `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` to escape template names before displaying them in admin areas.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in WordPress version 4.8.2.
*   The changesets indicate that the vulnerability exists in the `class-wp-plugins-list-table.php`, `template.php`, `plugin-editor.php`, `plugins.php`, and `theme-editor.php` files.

In summary, CVE-2017-14720 is an XSS vulnerability in WordPress arising from a lack of proper input validation, encoding and sanitization of plugin and template names, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the administrator's session. The fix involves adding URL encoding and proper escaping of these names in the admin interface, preventing the XSS attack.
