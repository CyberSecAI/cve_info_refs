Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2017-14534:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `location.php` file of NexusPHP 1.5, specifically on line 20. The code constructs a URL with user-controlled input through `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` without proper sanitization, which can lead to code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Unsanitized Input:** The `$SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable is used directly in the construction of a URL without proper encoding or sanitization.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The unsanitized input enables an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the generated URL that is displayed on the page.
* **Path Info Vulnerability (requires cgi.fix_pathinfo):** The exploit uses path info injection (e.g `/location.php/'%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(1)%3E`). When `cgi.fix_pathinfo` is enabled in php.ini, PHP attempts to execute code based on the path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Administrator Identity Theft:** The primary goal stated is to "get the administrator's identity". Although not explicitly stated, the XSS allows an attacker to potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other actions in the context of the administrator's session, allowing for identity theft or further attacks.
*   **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, perform actions on the victim's behalf, or redirect the user to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the XSS payload injected via `%20%24_SERVER%5B%27PHP_SELF%27%5D%20.`, the vulnerability requires a specially crafted url to exploit.
* **User Interaction:** The user needs to click the crafted URL.
*   **Configuration Requirement:** The attack is reliant on the server having `cgi.fix_pathinfo=On` within php.ini

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted link to the administrator or other user.
*   The targeted server needs to be running NexusPHP 1.5 with the `cgi.fix_pathinfo` setting enabled in its PHP configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit demonstrates a simple XSS payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`. A real attacker could use a more sophisticated payload to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.
* The code snippet mentions "location.php:20" which implies the vulnerable code is located on line 20 of the `location.php` file.
