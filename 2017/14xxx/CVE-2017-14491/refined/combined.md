SSA-689071: DNSMasq Vulnerabilities in SCALANCE W1750D,
SCALANCE M-800 / S615 and RUGGEDCOM RM1224

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.1

V1.3

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SCALANCE W1750D, SCALANCE M-800 / S615 and
RUGGEDCOM RM1224 devices. The highest scored vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to crash
the DNS service or execute arbitrary code. The attacker must be able to craft malicious DNS responses
and inject them into the network in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Siemens has released updates for the affected devices, recommends to update, and provides speciﬁc
countermeasures for unpatched devices.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• SCALANCE M-800 / S615 and RUGGEDCOM RM1224: Disable DNS proxy in the device conﬁgu-
ration (System - DNS - DNS Proxy - Disable Checkbox „Enable DNS Proxy“), and conﬁgure the
connected devices in the internal network to use a different DNS server

• SCALANCE W1750D: If “OpenDNS”, “Captive Portal” or “URL redirection” functionality is not used,

deploy ﬁrewall rules in the device conﬁguration to block incoming access to port 53/UDP

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE W1750D controller-based Direct Access Points support radio transmission according to
the latest IWLAN standard IEEE 802.11ac Wave 2.

The SCALANCE M-800 / S615 industrial routers are used for secure remote access to plants via mobile
networks, e.g. GPRS or UMTS with the integrated security functions of a ﬁrewall for protection against
unauthorized access and VPN to protect data transmission.

RUGGEDCOM RM1224 is a 4G ROUTER for wireless IP-communication from Ethernet based devices
via LTE(4G)- mobile radio, optimized for use in North America.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of several vulnerabilities affecting dnsmasq.  Three of these vulnerabilities ([CVE-2017-14491](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14491), [CVE-2017-14492](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14492), and [CVE-2017-14493](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14493)) have been rated as [Critical](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/), while the remaining four ([CVE-2017-14494](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14494), [CVE-2017-14495](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14495), [CVE-2017-14496](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14496), and [CVE-2017-13704](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13704)) have been rated as [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).  These issues were publicly disclosed on Monday, October 2nd, 2017.

## Background Information

dnsmasq is a popular lightweight DNS and DHCP server, often used in home networks and cloud environments as a caching DNS stub resolver and to manage DHCP leases.  It is provided in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it is used directly by applications including libvirt, and in a number of layered products.  Many vendors prefer dnsmasq for its low resource consumption, simple configuration and flexibility.  While it is not recommended for large-scale deployments or as an authoritative name server, it is commonly used as a local caching resolver and for small-scale LAN and cloud environments.

## Vulnerability Details

Six of these vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed under embargo by Google, and the seventh (CVE-2017-13704) was already public and fixed in the dnsmasq git repository.  Some of these affected DHCP functionality while others affected DNS, with impacts ranging from a crash, unbounded resource consumption up to potential code execution.  All seven could be triggered by malicious users on the network.

| **CVE** | **Severity** | **Introduced** | **Exposure** | **Nature of Flaw** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2017-14491 | Critical | All Versions | DNS | Heap buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14492 | Critical | 2.60 - 2.66 | IPv6 RA | Heap buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14493 | Critical | 2.60 - 2.66 | DHCPv6 | Stack buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14494 | Important | 2.60 - 2.66 | DHCPv6 | Information leak |
| CVE-2017-14495 | Important | 2.76 | EDNS0 | Memory exhaustion |
| CVE-2017-14496 | Important | 2.76 | EDNS0 | Segmentation fault |
| CVE-2017-13704 | Important | 2.77 | DNS | Segmentation fault |

Some of these vulnerabilities require particular options to be enabled to render dnsmasq vulnerable.  These options can appear on the command line or in a configuration file:

| **CVE** | **Configuration options that render dnsmasq vulnerable** |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2017-14492 | enable-ra slaac ra-only ra-names ra-advrouter ra-stateless |
| CVE-2017-14495 | add-mac add-cpe-id add-subnet |
| CVE-2017-14496 | add-mac add-cpe-id add-subnet |

**CVE-2017-14491: Critical**

This is the worst vulnerability, and the only one that affected all versions of dnsmasq in supported Red Hat products.  To trigger this flaw, an attacker would need to control a malicious domain (eg, *evil.com*) and send DNS requests to dnsmasq that would cause it to cache replies from that domain.  By carefully constructing DNS requests and responses, dnsmasq could be made to overflow an internal buffer on the heap, using content influenced by the attacker.  This could potentially be used to achieve code execution.

**CVE-2017-14492 and CVE-2017-14493: Critical**

These two vulnerabilities exist in IPv6/DHCPv6 functionality, and are also both buffer overflows (heap and stack, respectively).  Either could potentially be used to achieve code execution, although the use of gcc's Stack Smashing Protector (enabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7) should effectively reduce the impact of CVE-2017-14493 to only a crash.

A dnsmasq instance would only be vulnerable to these if DHCP was enabled and it was bound to an IPv6 interface.  Further, the attacker would need to be in a position to send crafted DHCPv6 or IPv6 Router Advertisement messages to the server - usually requiring administrator (root) privileges on a host on the local network.

Since DHCPv6 and IPv6 Router Advertisement support were only introduced after dnsmasq 2.60, versions earlier than this are not affected by this flaw.  We have not determined what exact release introduced the vulnerable code, other than that it was prior to dnsmasq version 2.66 (shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 and 7.3).

**CVE-2017-14494: Important**

This vulnerability also only exists in DHCPv6, and allows an attacker to cause dnsmasq to read out of bounds, revealing portions of the contents of its own memory in the DHCPv6 response packet.  While it did not seem possible to crash or gain control of dnsmasq, the information revealed could be used in conjunction with another flaw to bypass mitigations or, potentially, be sensitive in its own right.

Like the previous two vulnerabilities, this was first introduced in a version between 2.60 and 2.66 inclusive, and fixed in 2.78.  Versions prior to 2.59, as provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 5, are not affected.

**CVE-2017-14495: Important**

This vulnerability was in EDNS0 functionality (RFC-2671).  It manifested as a memory leak: when constructing EDNS0 portions of replies under certain conditions, dnsmasq would allocate an intermediate data structure and then fail to free it.  By sending a carefully selected sequence of DNS requests, an attacker could cause dnsmasq to allocate several kilobytes for each subsequent request, eventually consuming all available memory and crashing.

The affected code was introduced in dnsmasq version 2.76; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 was affected, but earlier major and minor versions were not.

**CVE-2017-14496: Important**

Also in EDNS0 code, this vulnerability is a sign-confusion flaw which would lead to memcpy() being called with a negative *size* argument.  memcpy() would interpret this as a very large positive integer and try to copy a larger region than was mapped, leading to a crash.  By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could deny service to all other processes or hosts reliant on dnsmasq as a resolver.

This flaw was also introduced in dnsmasq version 2.76; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 was affected, but earlier major and minor versions were not.

**CVE-2017-13704: Important**

Similar to CVE-2017-14496, the flaw was sign confusion, this time in the *size* argument given to memset(), and would lead to a crash.  The vulnerable memset() calls were introduced in dnsmasq 2.77 as a hardening measure, to zero buffers where response packets would be constructed, such that information leaks similar to CVE-2017-14494 would be avoided.  These calls to memset() were strictly a defensive measure as no such information leaks were previously known.  Following the discovery that these could go wrong, appropriate checks on the arguments to memset() were introduced.

This flaw was introduced in version 2.77 and fixed prior to 2.78.  No Red Hat products were affected.

## Impacted Products

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of [Critical](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

## Attack Description and Impact

Attackers with network access to an instance of dnsmasq could potentially carry out these attacks. This includes client machines or nodes on a LAN or WAN where dnsmasq is used as a caching resolver (as is optional on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host**) as well as users of virtual machines (such as those hosted by libvirt, **Red Hat OpenStack Platform** and **Red Hat OpenShift,** which use dnsmasq as part of network provisioning).

CVE-2017-14491 potentially impacts all uses of dnsmasq, while the other vulnerabilities require special conditions such as IPv6, DHCP being enabled or special options in the case of CVE-2017-11491, CVE-2017-14495, and CVE-2017-14496 (see table in the Overview tab).

Privileges of the running dnsmasq are futher restricted by SELinux policy, when SELinux is enabled, which reduces the impact of compromise and helps avoid full guest to host escapes. However, taking over dnsmasq's DNS and DHCP functionality is a significant impact even if full host compromise is not possible, as it could potentially affect other guests (virtual machines or containers) hosted in the same environment.

## Security Advisory 0030 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/3577-security-advisory-30?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** October 2nd, 2017

**Version:** 1.0

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | October 2nd, 2017 | Public release |
| 1.1 | October 3rd, 2017 | Updates to clarify impact and add mitigation |
| 1.2 | October 6th, 2017 | Updates to the affected software release table |
| 1.3 | October 11th, 2017 | Hotfix v1.1 has been updated |

A list of 6 CVEs affecting DNS and DHCP were publicly released on October 2nd, 2017 by the Google Security Research team. From internal investigations it has been confirmed that Arista Network's software products - EOS and Cloud Vision Portal (CVP) are not exploitable to the following DNS and DHCP vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-14495: DNS - Lack of free () - OOM/DoS

CVE-2017-14496: DNS - Invalid boundary checks and integer underflow - DoS

CVE-2017-14492: DHCP - Heap based overflow - RCE

CVE-2017-14493: DHCP - Stack based overflow - RCE

CVE-2017-14494: DHCP - Information leak

**This advisory documents the impact of CVE-2017-14491: DNS - 2 byte heap based overflow - RCE that affects some Arista Products**.

CVSS v2 Score 10
 CVSS v3 Score 9.8

This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary code, create a denial of service or an out of memory situation.

* EOS - Affected versions of EOS (documented in Table-1) are vulnerable to CVE-2017-14491 when configured to use a DNS server using the command ‘ip name-server’ in the default as well as non-default VRFs.
* CloudVision Portal is not affected by CVE-2017-14491

**Note:** There have been no external reports of an exploit, as of the date of this notice. Proof of concepts to evaluate if you are affected have been made available by the [Google security research](https://security.googleblog.com) team that discovered the vulnerabilities.

**Recommended Action:** For switches running any affected EOS version with the ‘ip name-server’ configuration, the immediate recommendation is to install a non-disruptive patch or to upgrade to a remediated version of EOS. Either step will prevent any exploit. Removing the ‘ip name-server’ command from default and non-default VRFs will serve as mitigation against this vulnerability.

A single patch for this issue is available for EOS versions 4.13.0 and all later versions up to 4.19.0 via the URL below. This patch can be installed non-disruptively. Applying this patch serves as a permanent resolution to this issue. Instructions to install the patch are available on page 3 of this advisory.

**Affected software releases:** All EOS releases shipped prior to the date of this release are affected. The following table only lists the affected EOS versions from the supported release trains.

**Note:**

* The patch is applicable only to EOS versions starting at 4.13.0 and later
* Installing the patch is **non-disruptive** to switch operation or traffic flowing through the switch
* A reload of the switch is **not required** for the patch to take effect

**Instructions to install the patch:**

1. Download the patch file and copy the file to the extension partition of the switch using one of the supported file transfer protocols:
   ```
   switch#copy scp://10.10.0.1/SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix extension:
   switch#verify /sha512 flash:SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix
   verify /sha512 (flash:securityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix) = 90329906ff83272bb90907d14c7a72b107e3971b15b6263244ee8d49757277505d637ee794b4a98a6b73d6b85b653a4ee36182690b00ee29b07adf91182e76bd

   ```
   Verify that the checksum value returned by the above command matches the provided SHA512 checksum for the file. On modular systems with dual supervisors, download the file to the extension partition of the active supervisor and copy it to the standby supervisor using the following two commands:
   ```
   switch(s1)(config)#copy extension:SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix supervisor-peer:/mnt/flash
   switch(s2-standby)#copy flash:SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix extension:

   ```
2. Install the patch using the extension command. The patch takes effect immediately at the time of installation.
   ```
   switch#extension SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix

   ```
   On modular systems with dual supervisors, the patch has to be installed on the active and standby supervisors:
   ```
   switch(s1)#extension SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix
   switch(s2-standby)#extension SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix

   ```
3. Verify that the patch is installed using the following commands.
   ```
    switch#show extension
   Name                                       Version/Release           Status extension
   ------------------------------------------ ------------------------- ------ ----
   SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix      2.77/6375386.erahndnsmasq A, I      1
   A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F: forced

   switch#show version detail | grep SecurityAdvisory0030
   dnsmasq-SecurityAdvisory0030 2.77            6375386.erahndnsmasqUpstreamFixesHotfix0.5
   dnsmasq-SecurityAdvisory0030 2.77            5968836.erahndnsmasqUpstreamFixesHotfix0.59

   ```
4. Verify that the following message is displayed in /var/log/messages
   ```
   Sep  29 19:22:55  SecurityAdvisory0030: Patch installed successfully
   Sep  29 19:22:55  python: %EXTENSION-6-INSTALLED: Extension SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix  has been installed.

   ```
5. Make the patch persistent across reloads. This ensures that the patch is installed as part of the boot-sequence. The patch will not install on EOS versions with the security fix.
   ```
   switch#copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
   switch#show boot-extensions
   SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix

   ```
   For dual supervisor systems run the above copy command on both active and standby supervisors:
   ```
   switch(s1)#copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
   switch(s2-standby)#copy installed-extensions to boot-extensions

   ```

**Note:**
 This patch (SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix) will automatically restart the dnsmasq service.
 With hotfix v1.0 (SecurityAdvisory0030-Hotfix.swix) that was released with the initial version of this security advisory, it is required to manually restart the dnsmasq service for switches running EOS versions 4.17.0 or later. If the switch was restarted after installing the hotfix v1.0, the switch is already protected and there is no need to restart the dnsmasq.
 To manually restart the dnsmasq service the following bash commands can be used.

```
switch#bash
 Arista Networks EOS shell
 [admin@switch ~]$ ps aux | grep dnsmasq
 root 3923 0.0 0.0 4424 1832 ? S Oct06 0:01 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq
 arastra 15669 0.0 0.0 4760 1516 pts/5 S+ 12:48 0:00 grep --color=auto dnsmasq
 [admin@switch ~]$ sudo killall dnsmasq
 [admin@switch ~]$ sudo service dnsmasq start
 Starting dnsmasq: [OK]
 [admin@switch ~]$ ps aux | grep dnsmasq
 root 16770 0.0 0.0 4424 1832 ? S Oct06 0:01 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq
 arastra 16793 0.0 0.0 4760 1516 pts/5 S+ 12:48 0:00 grep --color=auto dnsmasq
```

 The “ps aux | grep dnsmasq” commands are not required to restart dnsmasq, but are used to verify the restart by checking that dnsmasq has a new PID.

**Instructions to uninstall the patch:**

1. Uninstall the patch using the following command:
   ```
   switch#no extension securityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix
   ```
   On modular systems with dual supervisors, the patch has to be uninstalled on the active and standby supervisors:
   ```
   switch(s1)#no extension securityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix
   switch(s2-standby)#no extension securityAdvisory0030-Hotfix-v1.1.swix

   ```
   The output of ‘show extensions’ will reflect the status of the patch as ‘NI: Not installed’
   ```
   switch#show extension
   Name                                Version/Release            Status extension
   ----------------------------------- -------                    ------ ---------

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c0)  Fabio Olive Leite    2017-09-26 01:42:21 UTC  ``` Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of a heap-based buffer overflow affecting the DNS implementation of dnsmasq.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c3)  Doran Moppert    2017-09-26 05:10:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), Ron Bowes (Google Security Team)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2017-09-26 08:46:50 UTC  ``` Further details from the 2.78 pre-release CHANGELOG:      Fix heap overflow in DNS code. This is a potentially serious     security hole. It allows an attacker who can make DNS     requests to dnsmasq, and who controls the contents of     a domain, which is thereby queried, to overflow     (by 2 bytes) a heap buffer and either crash, or     even take control of, dnsmasq.     [CVE-2017-14491](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14491) applies.     Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana     and Kevin Hamacher of the Google Security Team for     finding this.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2017-09-26 10:46:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1330989](attachment.cgi?id=1330989&action=diff "Upstream commit") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1330989&action=edit "Upstream commit") Upstream commit   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2017-09-26 22:24:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1331241](attachment.cgi?id=1331241&action=diff "Follow-up patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1331241&action=edit "Follow-up patch from upstream") Follow-up patch from upstream  This corrects issues in the original patch as noted in [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c8).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c18)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-02 13:08:49 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/3199382> <https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c19)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-02 13:19:36 UTC  ``` Created dnsmasq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1497691](show_bug.cgi?id=1497691 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-14491 CVE-2017-14492 CVE-2017-14493 CVE-2017-14494 CVE-2017-14495 CVE-2017-14496 dnsmasq: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2017-10-02 13:41:34 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  <http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=commitdiff;h=0549c73b7ea6b22a3c49beb4d432f185a81efcbc> <http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=commitdiff;h=62cb936cb7ad5f219715515ae7d32dd281a5aa1f>  Google Security Team's repository with test cases:  <https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/vulnerabilities/dnsmasq>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 15:20:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2017:2840 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2840](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2840)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 15:54:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life  Via RHSA-2017:2841 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2841](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2841)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 16:23:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:2837 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2837](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2837)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 16:24:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:2838 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2838](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2838)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 17:09:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Telco Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:2839 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2839](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2839)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-02 17:20:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:2836 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2836](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2836)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1495409#c28)  Garth Mollett    2017-10-02 21:43:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform includes the dnsmasq-utils RPM which does not contain this flaw's affected code-paths; Red Hat OpenStack Platform is therefore listed as not affected.  However, because all versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all Red Hat OpenStack Platform users should absolutely upgrade the dnsmasq RPM from Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a matter of urgency using standard update mechanisms (such as 'yum update' or 'openstack overcloud update').   ``` |  |

Package        : dnsmasq
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-14491 CVE-2017-14492 CVE-2017-14493 CVE-2017-14494
                 CVE-2017-14495 CVE-2017-14496

Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana, Kevin Hamacher, Ron
Bowes and Gynvael Coldwind of the Google Security Team discovered
several vulnerabilities in dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and
DHCP/TFTP server, which may result in denial of service, information
leak or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.72-3+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.76-5+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2837)

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)
* A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (CVE-2017-14492)
* A stack buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)
* An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code. An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory, potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)

Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting these issues.

Summary

Dnsmasq is a widely used piece of open-source softwarea designed to provide DNS, DHCP, Dnsmasq 2.77 and before version contains 7 security vulnerabilities.

There is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in dnsmasq in the code responsible when building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-10139)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-14491.

There is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-10140)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-14492.

There is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2017-10141)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2017-14493.

# Security Research

This project hosts security advisories and their accompanying
proof-of-concepts related to research conducted at Google which impact
non-Google owned code.

We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. Vendors,
as well as researchers, must act responsibly. This is why Google adheres
to a 90-day disclosure deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities
immediately, with details shared in public with the defensive community
after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix.

You can read up on our full policy at:
<https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/>.

## Advisories

The disclosure of vulnerabilities are all in the form of security
advisories, which can be browsed in the [Security
Advisories](https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories?state=published)
page.

## Proof of Concepts

Accompanying proof-of-concept code will be used to demonstrate the
security vulnerabilities.

The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet

## [Behind the Masq: Yet more DNS, and DHCP, vulnerabilities](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html "Behind the Masq: Yet more DNS, and DHCP, vulnerabilities")

October 2, 2017

Posted by Fermin J. Serna, Staff Software Engineer, Matt Linton, Senior Security Engineer and Kevin Stadmeyer, Technical Program Manager

Our team has previously posted about [DNS vulnerabilities and exploits](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html). Lately, we’ve been busy reviewing the security of another DNS software package: [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html). We are writing this to disclose the issues we found and to publicize the patches in an effort to increase their uptake.

Dnsmasq provides functionality for serving DNS, DHCP, router advertisements and network boot. This software is commonly installed in systems as varied as desktop Linux distributions (like Ubuntu), home routers, and IoT devices. Dnsmasq is widely used both on the open [internet](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=dnsmasq) and internally in private networks.

We discovered seven distinct issues (listed below) over the course of our regular internal security assessments. Once we determined the severity of these issues, we worked to investigate their impact and exploitability and then produced internal proofs of concept for each of them. We also worked with the maintainer of Dnsmasq, Simon Kelley, to produce appropriate patches and mitigate the issue.

These patches have been upstreamed and are now committed to the [project’s git repository](http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=summary). In addition to these patches we have also submitted another patch which will run Dnsmasq under [seccomp-bpf](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt) to allow for additional sandboxing. This patch has been submitted to the DNSmasq project for review and we have also made it available [here](https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/blob/master/vulnerabilities/dnsmasq/sandbox/dnsmasq-sandbox.patch) for those who wish to integrate it into an existing install (after testing, of course!). We believe the adoption of this patch will increase the security of DNSMasq installations.

We would like to thank Simon Kelley for his help in patching these bugs in the core Dnsmasq codebase. Users who have deployed the [latest version](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/) of Dnsmasq (2.78) will be protected from the attacks discovered here. Android partners have received this patch as well and it will be included in Android's monthly security update for October. Kubernetes versions 1.5.8, 1.6.11, 1.7.7, and 1.8.0 have been released with a patched DNS pod. Other affected Google services have been updated.

During our review, the team found three potential remote code executions, one information leak, and three denial of service vulnerabilities affecting the latest version at the project git server as of September 5th 2017.

It is worth expanding on some of these:

* CVE-2017-14491 is a DNS-based vulnerability that affects both directly exposed and internal network setups. Although the latest git version only allows a 2-byte overflow, this could be exploited based on previous research. Before version 2.76 and this commit the overflow is unrestricted.

==1159==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62200001dd0b at pc 0x0000005105e7 bp 0x7fff6165b9b0 sp0x7fff6165b9a8

  #6 0x41cbe9 in \_start (/test/dnsmasq/src/dnsmasq+0x41cbe9)

* CVE-2017-14493 is a trivial-to-exploit DHCP-based, stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. In combination with CVE-2017-14494 acting as an info leak, an attacker could bypass ASLR and gain remote code execution.

dnsmasq[15714]: segfault at 1337deadbeef ip **00001337deadbeef** sp 00007fff1b66fd10 error 14 in libnss\_files-2.24.so[7f7cfbacb000+a000]

* Android is affected by CVE-2017-14496 when the attacker is local or tethered directly to the device—the service itself is sandboxed so the risk is reduced. Android partners received patches on 5 September 2017 and devices with a [2017-10-01 security patch level](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-10-01) or later address this issue.

Proofs of concept are provided so you can check if you are affected by these issues, and verify any mitigations you may deploy.

We would like to thank the following people for discovering, investigating impact/exploitability and developing PoCs: Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana, Kevin Hamacher, Ron Bowes and Gynvael Coldwind of the Google Security Team.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2836)

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)
* A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (CVE-2017-14492)
* A stack buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)
* An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code. An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory, potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)
* A memory exhaustion flaw was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets which would trigger memory allocations which would never be freed, leading to unbounded memory consumption and eventually a crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14495)
* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14496)

Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting these issues.

However, because all versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all Red Hat OpenStack Platform users should absolutely upgrade the dnsmasq RPM from Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a matter of urgency using standard update mechanisms (such as 'yum update' or 'openstack overcloud update').   ``` |  |

## Binary packages built by this source

[dnsmasq](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/dnsmasq):
Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server

Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP

 server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a

 small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are

 not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS

 server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses

 to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or

 in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic

 DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

[dnsmasq-base](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/dnsmasq-base):
Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server

This package contains the dnsmasq executable and documentation, but

 not the infrastructure required to run it as a system daemon. For

 that, install the dnsmasq package.

[dnsmasq-utils](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/dnsmasq-utils):
Utilities for manipulating DHCP leases

Small utilities to query a DHCP server's lease database and

 remove leases from it. These programs are distributed with dnsmasq

 and may not work correctly with other DHCP servers.

https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html

1) Build the docker and open three terminals

docker build -t dnsmasq .
docker run --rm -t -i --name dnsmasq_test dnsmasq bash
docker cp poc.py dnsmasq_test:/poc.py
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash

2) On one terminal let’s launch attacker controlled DNS server:

# python poc.py  127.0.0.2 53
Listening at 127.0.0.2:53

3) On another terminal let’s launch dnsmasq forwarding queries to attacker controlled DNS:

# /testing/dnsmasq/src/dnsmasq -p 53535 --no-daemon --log-queries -S 127.0.0.2 --no-hosts --no-resolv
dnsmasq: started, version 2.78test2-8-ga3303e1 cachesize 150
dnsmasq: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt no-DBus no-i18n no-IDN DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP no-conntrack ipset auth no-DNSSEC loop-detect inotify
dnsmasq: using nameserver 127.0.0.2#53
dnsmasq: cleared cache

4) Let’s fake a client making a request twice (or more) so we hit the dnsmasq cache:

# dig @localhost -p 53535 -x 8.8.8.125 > /dev/null
# dig @localhost -p 53535 -x 8.8.8.125 > /dev/null

5)  The crash might not be triggered on the first try due to the non-deterministic order of the dnsmasq cache. Restarting dnsmasq and retrying should be sufficient to trigger a crash.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

docker build -t dnsmasq .docker run --rm -t -i --name dnsmasq\_test dnsmasq bashdocker cp poc.py dnsmasq\_test:/poc.pydocker exec -it <container\_id> bashdocker exec -it <container\_id> bash
2) On one terminal let’s launch attacker controlled DNS server:
# python poc.py 127.0.0.2 53Listening at 127.0.0.2:53
3) On another terminal let’s launch dnsmasq forwarding queries to attacker controlled DNS:
# /testing/dnsmasq/src/dnsmasq -p 53535 --no-daemon --log-queries -S 127.0.0.2 --no-hosts --no-resolvdnsmasq: started, version 2.78test2-8-ga3303e1 cachesize 150dnsmasq: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt no-DBus no-i18n no-IDN DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP no-conntrack ipset auth no-DNSSEC loop-detect inotifydnsmasq: using nameserver 127.0.0.2#53dnsmasq: cleared cache
4) Let’s fake a client making a request twice (or more) so we hit the dnsmasq cache:
# dig @localhost -p 53535 -x 8.8.8.125 > /dev/null# dig @localhost -p 53535 -x 8.8.8.125 > /dev/null
5) The crash might not be triggered on the first try due to the non-deterministic order of the dnsmasq cache. Restarting dnsmasq and retrying should be sufficient to trigger a crash.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Synopsis

Critical: dnsmasq security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2839)

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Telco Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)

Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting this issue.

[Simon Kelley](/search?l=dnsmasq-discuss@lists.thekelleys.org.uk&q=from:%22Simon+Kelley%22)
[Mon, 02 Oct 2017 07:22:49 -0700](/search?l=dnsmasq-discuss@lists.thekelleys.org.uk&q=date:20171002)

```
I've just released dnsmasq-2.78, which addresses a series of serious
security vulnerabilities which have been found in dnsmasq by the Google
security team. Some of these, including the most serious, have been in
dnsmasq since prehistoric times, and have remained undetected through
multiple previous security audits.
```
```

Google's release about this can be found at:

<https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html>

Information on these bugs has been made available in advance through the
usual channels and updates to distribution packages, firmware images and
Android should be available now or very soon.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the people at Google who've
been working with me on this. Releasing information of vulnerabilities
like this in a responsible and organised manner is a fairly daunting
prospect for the uninitiated, and they've been very helpful in helping
to work through the processes. Especial thanks go to Matt Linton and
Kevin Stadmeyer.

Cheers,

Simon.

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2017-24f067299e
2017-10-06 13:44:21.530944
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 26
Version : 2.76
Release : 5.fc26
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2017-7106a157f5
2017-10-24 05:24:57.485581
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 27
Version : 2.77
Release : 9.fc27
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

  In dnsmasq before 2.78, if the DNS packet size does not match the expected size, the size parameter in a memset call gets a negative value. As it is an unsigned value, memset ends up writing up to 0xffffffff zero's (0xffffffffffffffff in 64 bit platforms), making dnsmasq crash.

**Mitigation**

For an immediate workaround, please contact us at security@synology.com.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2017-515264ae24
2017-10-23 16:38:52.585287
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 25
Version : 2.76
Release : 4.fc25
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [dnsmasq](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.59-4ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.59-4ubuntu0.4)
* [dnsmasq-utils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.59-4ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.59-4ubuntu0.4)
* [dnsmasq-base](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.59-4ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.59-4ubuntu0.4)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

```
I've just released a new stable version of dnsmasq 2.78

Download is available at
```
```

<http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-2.78.tar.gz>

This is a bugfix release, and, amongst other things, addresses a set of
serious security vulnerabilities. Update should be mandatory.

CHANGELOG is attached below.

version 2.78
        Fix logic of appending ".<layer>" to PXE basename. Thanks to
        Chris Novakovic for the patch.

        Revert ping-check of address in DHCPDISCOVER if there
        already exists a lease for the address. Under some
        circumstances, and netbooted windows installation can reply
        to pings before if has a DHCP lease and block allocation
        of the address it already used during netboot. Thanks to
        Jan Psota for spotting this.

        Fix DHCP relaying, broken in 2.76 and 2.77 by commit
        ff325644c7afae2588583f935f4ea9b9694eb52e. Thanks to
        John Fitzgibbon for the diagnosis and patch.

        Try other servers if first returns REFUSED when
        --strict-order active. Thanks to Hans Dedecker
        for the patch

        Fix regression in 2.77, ironically added as a security
        improvement, which resulted in a crash when a DNS
        query exceeded 512 bytes (or the EDNS0 packet size,
        if different.) Thanks to Christian Kujau, Arne Woerner
        Juan Manuel Fernandez and Kevin Darbyshire-Bryant for
        chasing this one down.  CVE-2017-13704 applies.

        Fix heap overflow in DNS code. This is a potentially serious
        security hole. It allows an attacker who can make DNS
        requests to dnsmasq, and who controls the contents of
        a domain, which is thereby queried, to overflow
        (by 2 bytes) a heap buffer and either crash, or
        even take control of, dnsmasq.
        CVE-2017-14491 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.
        Fix heap overflow in IPv6 router advertisement code.
        This is a potentially serious security hole, as a
        crafted RA request can overflow a buffer and crash or
        control dnsmasq. Attacker must be on the local network.
        CVE-2017-14492 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        and Kevin Hamacher of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix stack overflow in DHCPv6 code. An attacker who can send
        a DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq can overflow the stack frame and
        crash or control dnsmasq.
        CVE-2017-14493 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix information leak in DHCPv6. A crafted DHCPv6 packet can
        cause dnsmasq to forward memory from outside the packet
        buffer to a DHCPv6 server when acting as a relay.
        CVE-2017-14494 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix DoS in DNS. Invalid boundary checks in the
        add_pseudoheader function allows a memcpy call with negative
        size An attacker which can send malicious DNS queries
        to dnsmasq can trigger a DoS remotely.
        dnsmasq is vulnerable only if one of the following option is
        specified: --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet.
        CVE-2017-14496 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix out-of-memory Dos vulnerability. An attacker which can
        send malicious DNS queries to dnsmasq can trigger memory
        allocations in the add_pseudoheader function
        The allocated memory is never freed which leads to a DoS
        through memory exhaustion. dnsmasq is vulnerable only
        if one of the following option is specified:
        --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet.
        CVE-2017-14495 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.
