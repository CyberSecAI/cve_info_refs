CVE ID         : CVE-2016-10209 CVE-2016-10349   CVE-2016-10350
                 CVE-2017-14166 CVE-2017-14501   CVE-2017-14502
		 CVE-2017-14503 CVE-2018-1000877 CVE-2018-1000878
		 CVE-2018-1000880

Multiple security issues were found in libarchive, a multi-format archive
and compression library: Processing malformed RAR archives could result
in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code and malformed
WARC, LHarc, ISO, Xar or CAB archives could result in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.

For the detailed security status of libarchive please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libarchive>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Package        : libarchive

CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8915 CVE-2016-8687 CVE-2016-8688
                 CVE-2016-8689 CVE-2016-10209 CVE-2016-10349
                 CVE-2016-10350 CVE-2017-5601 CVE-2017-14166
                 CVE-2017-14501 CVE-2017-14502 CVE-2017-14503
Debian Bug     : 853278 875960 875974 875966 874539 840934
                 840935 861609 859456 861609 784213

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in libarchive, a
multi-format archive and compression library. Heap-based buffer
over-reads, NULL pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds reads allow
remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash) via
specially crafted archive files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.1.2-11+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
