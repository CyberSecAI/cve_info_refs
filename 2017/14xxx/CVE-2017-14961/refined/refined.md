      "source": "www.greyhathacker.net_929bca0e_20250126_040849.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the inputted output buffer address (Irp->UserBuffer) being saved on the stack which is later used without being validated when using as an argument.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary Write"
       ],
       "impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite the _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure, specifically the “Present” and “Enabled” fields, leading to privilege escalation.",
       "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific IOCTL (0x8300000c) to the vulnerable driver, without input buffer, providing output buffer address.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to open a handle to the vulnerable driver and send IOCTL requests.  Low privileged user can trigger the vulnerability."
