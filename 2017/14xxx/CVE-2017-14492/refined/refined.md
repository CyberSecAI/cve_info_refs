    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attack via crafted IPv6 router advertisement request"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the local network segment and able to send crafted RAs to the vulnerable dnsmasq instance.  Vulnerable configurations use one of the options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless."
