```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a map and unmap mismatch within the gralloc module. When mapping a buffer, the mapped address plus an offset is saved. However, during unmapping, the saved address is directly used for unmapping without considering the offset, leading to a use-after-unmap condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-unmap"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to unmap arbitrary pages in the system_server process from a sandboxed Chrome render process. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the privileged system_server process, allowing the attacker to gain elevated privileges and control the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the Android system's binder mechanism, specifically when the system_server handles a specially crafted GraphicBuffer object. This object can be sent to system_server by a malicious Chrome render process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to run code within a Chrome's sandboxed render process. From there, the attacker can manipulate graphic buffer objects, triggering the vulnerability in the system_server process. This requires a successful RCE exploit inside the chrome sandbox first to then reach the system service and exploit the UAF."
