- Root cause of vulnerability: A memory leak vulnerability exists in the `ReadXCFImage` function of ImageMagick. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted XCF image file, leading to memory leaks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory leak.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering excessive memory consumption through crafted XCF files.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted XCF image file using ImageMagick.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted XCF file to a user or system using ImageMagick for processing.
