{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ReadXBMImage` function in `coders/xbm.c`. Specifically, when processing XBM images with version 10, a loop iterates based on `image->rows` and `bytes_per_line` without proper checks for the end of the input data. A crafted XBM file with large `image->rows` and `image->columns` values but insufficient data can lead to an infinite loop, causing excessive CPU and memory consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing EOF Check: The loop in the `ReadXBMImage` function that processes the XBM data does not check for the end-of-file condition, leading to an infinite loop if the provided data is insufficient.",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization: The code does not properly validate the declared size of the image against the actual data, allowing an attacker to claim a large image size while providing minimal image data."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS): By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause the ImageMagick process to consume excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to a denial of service. This impact was confirmed in tests with 100% CPU usage and up to 4GB memory consumption for more than 7 minutes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted XBM Image File: An attacker can create a malicious XBM image file with manipulated image dimensions that trigger the vulnerability when processed by ImageMagick."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to craft XBM image files.",
      "Ability to provide the crafted XBM to a system processing it with ImageMagick."
