- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Korenix JetNet devices use hard-coded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can gain remote access to the device and potentially run arbitrary code. This could also lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. A low skill level is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
