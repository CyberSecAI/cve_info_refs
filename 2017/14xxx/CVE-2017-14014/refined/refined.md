Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key to encrypt Personal Health Information (PHI) before transferring it to removable media.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The device uses a hard-coded cryptographic key for encryption, making it easily discoverable and exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive patient health information (PHI).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the affected device (Boston Scientific ZOOM LATITUDE PRM - Model 3120).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the device.
- The attacker requires a low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory also mentions a separate vulnerability (CVE-2017-14012) related to the missing encryption of sensitive data at rest.
- Boston Scientific will not issue a product update to address these vulnerabilities, they recommend implementing compensating controls such as: controlling access to the device, maintaining the device in a locked location, and removing PHI prior to retiring or removing the device.
