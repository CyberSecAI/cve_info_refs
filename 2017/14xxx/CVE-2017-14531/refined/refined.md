{
  "CVE-2017-14531": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in memory allocation",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `sun_info.length` variable, read from the image file, is a 32-bit value that can be as large as 0xffffffff (4GB). This value is used in `AcquireQuantumMemory` to allocate memory, without proper validation.",
      "The `AcquireQuantumMemory` function attempts to allocate the requested memory, which can lead to a large allocation based on the provided length potentially leading to denial of service by exhausting available RAM."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service. If an attacker provides a malicious image file with a large size for `sun_info.length`, it can cause ImageMagick to attempt to allocate a large amount of RAM potentially leading to an out of memory condition.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file, where an attacker can control the `sun_info.length` value which determines the amount of memory to be allocated."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed SUN image file to a user or system running ImageMagick."
    ],
        "Additional details": "The issue is specifically in the `ReadSUNImage` function, where `sun_info.length` is read and used for memory allocation. The maximum allocatable memory by `AcquireQuantumMemory` is mentioned as 4GB, which aligns with the potential overflow scenario. An attacker can control `sun_info.length` via the image file. This can be used to trigger a large memory allocation by passing a large value to `sun_info.length` resulting in an out-of-memory condition and crash of the application. "
