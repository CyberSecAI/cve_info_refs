Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how EMC Isilon OneFS handles default NFS export settings. When changes are made to the default security flavor (authentication method) for NFS exports, these changes are not consistently propagated to all new and existing exports that are configured to use the default settings.
*   Specifically, if an administrator changes the default security flavor to a stronger one, NFS exports configured to use the default settings and mounted *after* this change might still use the original, weaker security flavor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Configuration Propagation:** Changes to default NFS security settings are not reliably applied to all relevant exports.
*   **Fallback to Weaker Authentication:** Exports can fall back to using a less secure authentication method (default flavor) than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers might gain access to NFS exports by exploiting the fallback to a weaker authentication method.
*   **Data Exposure and Manipulation:** If successful, attackers could potentially access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data on the affected exports.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack would be carried out over the network, targeting the NFS service.
*   **NFS Client:** Attackers would need to be able to mount the vulnerable NFS exports using an NFS client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the NFS service on the vulnerable EMC Isilon OneFS system.
*   **NFS Client Capabilities:** The attacker must have an NFS client that can mount the vulnerable exports.
*   **Understanding of Default Security Flavors:** An attacker would need to be aware that the system might allow mounting with a weaker authentication method than expected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N). This indicates a network-based attack with high complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, and a potential impact of low confidentiality and low integrity with no impact to availability.
*   The provided advisory includes workarounds involving manually refreshing NFS exports after creation or modification using the `isi nfs exports reload` or `/usr/likewise/bin/lwsm refresh nfs` commands.
*   EMC recommends upgrading to the specified patched versions to resolve this vulnerability.
