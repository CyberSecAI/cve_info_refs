ESA-2017-161: EMC Isilon OneFS NFS Export Security Setting Fallback Vulnerability

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-161

CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-14387

Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 4.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Affected products:
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.1.0.0
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.1.0 -- 8.0.1.1
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.0.0 - 8.0.0.4

Summary:
EMC Isilon OneFS requires a security update to address an issue that may potentially allow NFS clients to access
certain NFS exports using a weaker authentication flavor when default NFS export settings are modified.

Details:
OneFS NFS service maintains default NFS export settings (including NFS export security flavor for authentication) that
can be leveraged by current and future NFS exports. OneFS NFS service contained a flaw that did not properly propagate
changes made to the default security flavor to all new and existing NFS exports that are configured to use default NFS
export settings and that are mounted after those changes are made. This flaw may potentially allow NFS clients to
access affected NFS exports using the default and potentially weaker security flavor even if a more secure one was
selected to be used by the OneFS administrator.

Resolution:
The following versions of EMC Isilon OneFS resolve this vulnerability:
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.1.0.1
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.1.2
*       EMC Isilon OneFS 8.0.0.5
EMC recommends that all customers upgrade to a version containing the resolution at the earliest opportunity.

If you cannot upgrade at this time, you can perform the workaround below.

Workaround:
After you create or modify an export, and before you mount that export, manually refresh the exports by running either
of the following commands:

isi nfs exports reload

or

/usr/likewise/bin/lwsm refresh nfs
