- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the DCOM interface of Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation, specifically, the system does not properly handle specially-crafted messages sent to its DCOM interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where services on the affected devices crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is launched remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a member of the administrators group. They also need to have network access to the affected system.
