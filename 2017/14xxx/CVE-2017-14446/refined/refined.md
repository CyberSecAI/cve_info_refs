- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `HTTPExecuteGet` function in the Insteon Hub firmware doesn't properly check the number of GET parameters extracted from the query string. It uses a local array on the stack to store pointers to these parameters. The function `sub_9d043e0c` populates this array without verifying if the number of extracted parameters exceeds the size of the array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `sub_9d043e0c` function due to unchecked size when copying parameter pointers into a fixed-size buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the saved return address (`$ra`) and other saved registers on the stack within the context of the `insteon_HTTPExecuteGet` function, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The provided PoC only crashes the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the Insteon Hub's web server that includes more than 4 parameters in the query string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Insteon Hub. They must also be able to provide valid basic authentication credentials in order to trigger the vulnerable `HTTPExecuteGet` function.
