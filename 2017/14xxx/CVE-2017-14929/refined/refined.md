Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14929:

**CVE Description:** The provided content does not contain the official CVE description. However, it states "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the poppler PDF rendering library, which could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is processed."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The primary cause is an infinite loop within the `Gfx::displaySlice()` function, triggered by a series of nested calls involving `Gfx::display`, `Gfx::go`, `Gfx::execOp`, `Gfx::opFill`, `Gfx::doPatternFill`, `Gfx::doTilingPatternFill`, and `Gfx::drawForm`. This infinite loop eventually leads to memory corruption in `Object::dictLookup()`, and crashes within Lexer::getObj, causing a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop in the graphics rendering logic of Poppler, specifically within the `Gfx::displaySlice()` function
- **Memory Corruption:** The infinite loop leads to memory corruption in `Object::dictLookup()`, eventually resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop and subsequent crash can cause the application or service using the Poppler library to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not directly stated in the provided information the CVE description notes the possibility of arbitrary code execution. The memory corruption could be further exploited to achieve this impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector involves processing a specially crafted, malicious PDF file. The structure of this file causes the vulnerable code paths to be triggered, resulting in the infinite loop and memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide a Malicious PDF File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to an application or service using the vulnerable version of Poppler. This could be through any method that the application accepts PDF input (e.g., file upload, email attachment, etc.).

**Additional Details:**
- **Specific Code Path:** The provided call stack clearly shows the series of nested function calls that lead to the infinite loop and crash, highlighting the specific area of the code vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Proof of Concept:** A Proof-of-Concept (POC) PDF file is available, further validating the vulnerability and allowing for easier reproduction and analysis.
- **Fix:** The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4097-1 indicates that the issues are fixed in poppler version 0.26.5-2+deb8u3 (jessie) and 0.48.0-2+deb9u2 (stretch).
