Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14129:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap out-of-bounds read in the `parse_comp_unit()` function of the binutils library. Specifically, it occurs within the DWARF processing logic when handling string sections. The root cause is that DWARF sections containing strings are not always null-terminated and the code assumes that they are.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read. The `parse_comp_unit` function reads beyond the allocated buffer when processing a DWARF string section that lacks a null terminator. This is triggered during the disassembly of a compiled object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The heap out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the `objdump` utility when processing a crafted object file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted object file is processed by the `objdump` utility. 
- The attacker can entice a user to process a malicious file, which would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted object file to a user, who would then run the `objdump` utility with it as an argument.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified through fuzz testing.
- The fix involves ensuring DWARF sections containing strings are null-terminated before processing.
- There are two fixes: The first adds a null byte and the second allocates a buffer with an extra byte so a null byte can be added when reading the section contents using `bfd_simple_get_relocated_section_contents`.
- The vulnerable code is present in `dwarf2.c` file within the `bfd` library.
- The vulnerability is present in `binutils` version 2.29 and fixed in version 2.29.1.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the `objdump` command with specific options.
