{
  "CVE-2017-14489": {
    "Description": "The iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect length validation in the `iscsi_if_rx` function when parsing netlink messages.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds write."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Local user with permission to manage iSCSI devices."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to send crafted netlink messages to the iSCSI subsystem.",
    "Additional details": [
        "The vulnerability occurs when `skb->len` equals `nlh->nlmsg_len` and both are equal to `sizeof(*nlh)`. In this case, `ev = nlmsg_data(nlh)` will point to `skb_shinfo(SKB)` instead of the intended data, leading to overwriting `skb_shinfo(SKB)->nr_frags` with `ev->type`.",
      "A commit (7f564528a480084e2318cd48caba7aef4a54a77f) reordered struct skb_shared_info's fields which prevented the immediate crash, however, the underlying out of bounds write vulnerability was not fixed until a later patch",
      "The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions v2.6.24-rc1 through 4.13.2."
