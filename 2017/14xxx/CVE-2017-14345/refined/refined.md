Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2017-14345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `view.php` file. Specifically, the `$id` parameter, obtained from the GET request, is directly used in a SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the attacker can control the `$id` parameter and inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided exploit demonstrates that an attacker can use SQL injection to extract database information, such as the database version and the database name.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on the database permissions and the application's design, a successful SQL injection could lead to more severe consequences, such as data modification, data deletion, or even remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `view.php` file. The attacker modifies the `id` parameter to include SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `view.php` file. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- Vulnerable File: `view.php`
- Vulnerable Line: `Line 6`
- Vulnerable Code:
```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$query = "select * from `arts` where `id`='$id' limit 1";
$result = mysql_query($query);
$row = mysql_fetch_array($result);
```
- Exploit Example:
```
GET /view.php?id=-1' union select 1,version(),3,database(),5,6# HTTP/1.1
```

This request injects the following SQL payload into the `$id` variable: `-1' union select 1,version(),3,database(),5,6#`. This bypasses the intended query and returns results from the attacker's injected query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses `mysql_query`, which is deprecated, indicating the use of an older MySQL extension.
- The response confirms the successful injection by displaying the database version in the page title.
