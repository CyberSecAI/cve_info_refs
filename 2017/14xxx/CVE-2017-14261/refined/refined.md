Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to incorrect handling of data within the Bento4 library, specifically while processing MP4 files. The identified issue mentions an "Exploitable Write Access Violation" and a "Non Exploitable Memory Violation", both stemming from issues in how array access and memory operations are performed. The main points of concern seem to be:
*   Incorrect calculations or lack of bounds checking when reading/writing to arrays (as seen in `Ap4StscAtom.cpp`, `Ap4StssAtom.cpp`, `Ap4StszAtom.cpp`)
*   Improper handling of sizes and counts, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Exploitable Write Access Violation:**
    *   Occurs in `Ap4StscAtom.cpp:95`, `Ap4StssAtom.cpp:87` and related to `AP4_Array<AP4_StscTableEntry>::SetItemCount` .
    *   The code attempts to write data to memory locations that might not be allocated or are outside the intended buffer.
    *   This write violation is considered exploitable.

2.  **Non Exploitable Memory Violation:**
    *   Occurs in `Ap4StszAtom.cpp:84`
    *   Memory is accessed incorrectly, but in a manner that does not lead to immediate exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The "Exploitable Write Access Violation" can lead to crashes or, more seriously, arbitrary code execution by overwriting parts of the memory that affect the behavior of the application.
*   The "Non Exploitable Memory Violation" could cause application crashes and may be a source for further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted MP4 file.
*   By providing a malicious MP4 file, an attacker can trigger the memory corruption vulnerabilities within the Bento4 library during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to an application using the vulnerable Bento4 library.
*   No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to cause the vulnerable application to process the malformed MP4.

**Summary:**

The provided issue report details multiple memory-related vulnerabilities in the Bento4 library.  An exploitable write access violation is caused by improper array manipulation when processing MP4 files. This could lead to arbitrary code execution. A separate memory violation, while not immediately exploitable, indicates further potential issues. The attack vector relies on a malicious MP4 file, and the attacker needs to have a vulnerable application parse the crafted file to trigger the exploit.

This issue appears to be relevant to CVE-2017-14261 due to the memory corruption issues that are known to exist.
