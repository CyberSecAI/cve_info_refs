Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The `git-cvsserver` subcommand in Git uses the Perl backtick operator unsafely, leading to a shell command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- **Shell command injection:** The use of backticks in Perl allows for arbitrary shell commands to be executed if user-controlled input is not properly sanitized or escaped.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server where `git-cvsserver` is running. This can lead to complete system compromise depending on the permissions of the git process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `git-cvsserver` subcommand is reachable through the `git-shell` subcommand. 
- The vulnerability exists even if CVS support has not been explicitly configured, as long as the `git-cvs` package is installed.
- The vulnerability is triggered by user controlled input provided via the cvsserver functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the `git cvsserver` command through a channel that allows them to influence the commands that are executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves using `safe_pipe_capture()` instead of backticks, and the removal of `cvsserver` subcommand from `git-shell` by default
- The issue was discovered by joernchen from Phenoelit.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of git
- While git cvs may not be configured it only needs to be installed.
- The advisory mentions that release notes in commit messages incorrectly stated "git daemon" instead of "git shell".
