Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-14042:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ReadPNMImage` function within `coders/pnm.c` of GraphicsMagick. Specifically, the code did not verify if sufficient file data exists to support the image dimensions specified in the file header before allocating memory. This could lead to a memory allocation failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the input file size against the image header's data requirements. The code allocated memory based on the dimensions read from the PNM file header without ensuring that enough data was present in the file.
- **Memory Allocation Failure:** When processing a crafted PNM file with misleading dimensions, the program attempts to allocate memory larger than the available file data can fill. This results in a memory allocation failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. The program will fail to allocate the needed memory, leading to an abort, thereby crashing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed PNM Image File:** The attack vector is a crafted PNM image file. An attacker can create a file that specifies large dimensions in the header but contains insufficient data to fill the required memory.
- **Processing of untrusted files:** A user needs to open a specially crafted image file which then causes the application to crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed PNM file to an application that utilizes GraphicsMagick to process images.
- **No special privileges needed:** The attacker does not need any elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability, just the ability to cause an application to process a crafted image file.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The fix involves checking if the remaining file size is sufficient for the size defined in the header before memory allocation. This prevents large allocations based on corrupted headers.
*   The specific commit that fixes the issue is `3bbf7a13643d` in the GraphicsMagick repository.
*   The vulnerability was reported privately to the upstream maintainers on 2017-07-12.
