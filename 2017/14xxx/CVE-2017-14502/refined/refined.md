Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-14502:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an off-by-one error when handling UTF-16 encoded filenames within RAR archives. Specifically, the `read_header` function in `archive_read_support_format_rar.c` incorrectly calculates the size needed for the filename buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The off-by-one error leads to reading one byte beyond the allocated buffer while processing the UTF-16 filename.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash due to accessing invalid memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition when processing a specially crafted RAR archive.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability may allow to expose sensitive information. (From USN-3859-1)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted RAR archive to the vulnerable libarchive library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RAR file to be processed by a system using the vulnerable `libarchive` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by OSS-Fuzz (issue 573).
- The fix was implemented in the libarchive commit [5562545b5562f6d12a4ef991fae158bf4ccf92b6](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/5562545b5562f6d12a4ef991fae158bf4ccf92b6).
- The vulnerability is present in versions of libarchive prior to 3.3.3.
- Patches have been released for various distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo.
- The vulnerability is present in the `archive_read_format_rar_read_header` function.
- The specific location of the bug is in line 1496 in `archive_read_support_format_rar.c`, where filename size is incremented by two and another null byte is added to the string in the next line, this can cause out of bound read for UTF16 filenames in RAR archives.
