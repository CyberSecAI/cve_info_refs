{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the LabF nfsAxe FTP Client when handling a specially crafted server response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a long server response, specifically within the initial server greeting. This allows overwriting of the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) record.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The exploit demonstrates a technique to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is remote and is triggered when the vulnerable FTP client connects to a malicious server. The attacker controls the server and the crafted response.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious FTP server and lure the victim into connecting to it. The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's vulnerability and its memory layout to craft the exploit."
