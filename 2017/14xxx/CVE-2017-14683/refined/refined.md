```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in geminabox.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can perform unwanted actions on the application by sending malicious requests through a victim's browser, such as deleting gems from the server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting malicious links or embedding malicious code on other websites, an attacker can trick a user into performing actions on their geminabox instance without their knowledge.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request that exploits the missing CSRF protection. The attacker can be an external attacker.
