The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14963.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IKARUS anti.virus driver saving the user-supplied output buffer address (`Irp->UserBuffer`) on the stack, and then using it later without proper validation. This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the destination address of a write operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary Write vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the handling of IOCTL `0x83000058`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations in the kernel. This can lead to privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request (0x83000058) to the vulnerable device driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver. This typically requires some level of access to the system, usually local access.
