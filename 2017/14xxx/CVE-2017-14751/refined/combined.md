### [Shortcode for Forms Not Working](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/shortcode-for-forms-not-working/)

I tried to add a Contact 7 form and Formidable Form Builder shortcode. Both did not work to override the default form.
What next?

Tried this out. Didn’t let me override how applicants apply or modify the application form. Also didn’t work with my theme.
