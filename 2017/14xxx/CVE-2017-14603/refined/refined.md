Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) packets within the Asterisk software. Specifically, the system wasn't properly verifying if incoming packets were genuine RTCP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate RTCP Packet Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of thorough checks on incoming RTCP packets. This allows the system to process data that is not a valid RTCP packet.
*   **Information Leak:** Due to the insufficient validation, the system could potentially read stale buffer contents.
*   **RTP Stream Qualification Bypass**: The RTP stream qualification logic that was meant to prevent media hijacking by accepting only the first RTP packet was bypassed, allowing an attacker to spoof media sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data present in the system's memory by reading stale buffer contents due to processing invalid RTCP packets.
*   **Redirection of RTCP Reports:** When combined with certain configuration options ("nat" and "symmetric\_rtp"), this vulnerability could be exploited to redirect where Asterisk sends the next RTCP report.
*   **Media Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack media streams by spoofing the source of the RTP packets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** Attackers could send crafted or invalid RTCP packets to the affected Asterisk server via the network.
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable Asterisk server to send malicious packets.
*   **Ability to Craft Packets:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific invalid RTCP packets to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is a follow-up to AST-2017-005, indicating a previous attempt to address related issues.
*   The fix involves validating RTCP packets before processing and discarding invalid ones. RTP stream qualification now requires a series of packets from the same address before accepting a new source address.
*   The issue was addressed in Asterisk versions 11.25.3, 13.17.2, 14.6.2 and certified versions 11.6-cert18, 13.13-cert6
*   The vulnerability is considered **critical**.
