The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14436.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the web server functionality of the Moxa EDR-810 router. The vulnerability occurs when a GET request is sent to specific URIs (/MOXA_CFG2.ini) without a cookie header, resulting in a null pointer dereference when calling `strcmp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, which occurs when the cookie header is missing in the HTTP request and no value is available, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the web server, leading to a denial of service condition on the device. This can disrupt the operations of critical infrastructure where the device is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending an HTTP GET request to specific URIs (/MOXA_CFG2.ini) without a cookie header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges and can be unauthenticated.
