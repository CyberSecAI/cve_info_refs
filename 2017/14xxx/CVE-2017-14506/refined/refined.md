Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically within the `gem.homepage` value in the `.gemspec` file of uploaded Ruby gems. The Geminabox application fails to sanitize this input when rendering it on the web UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious payload from the crafted `gem.homepage` and displays it on the web UI. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can be executed in the victim's browser, allowing an attacker to perform any action that the user is authorized to do on the Geminabox application, such as deleting gems, redirecting the user to other websites, or causing DoS attacks.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially enumerate and delete all the gems on the server, rendering the geminabox instance unusable.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can inject javascript code to crash the user browser, preventing users from accessing and using the web app.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Gem Upload:** An attacker creates a malicious gem with a crafted `gem.homepage` in its `.gemspec` file.
- **Upload Mechanism:** The attacker uploads the malicious gem to the Geminabox server, either directly or through a CSRF/SSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a malicious gem file.**
- **Ability to upload the crafted gem file** to the vulnerable Geminabox instance. This can be done either directly if the attacker has access to the upload interface, or indirectly via CSRF/SSRF attacks if direct access is not available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided blog post by Barak Tawily confirms this vulnerability and provides a clear explanation of the attack scenario.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file confirms that this vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-14506 and was fixed in version 0.13.6.
