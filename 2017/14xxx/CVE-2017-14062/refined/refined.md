Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_digit()` function within the Punycode handling of the `libidn` and `libidn2` libraries.  Punycode is used for encoding Unicode characters to ASCII.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow during the decoding process of Punycode. This overflow can lead to incorrect memory calculations and other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. This may manifest as an application crash, making the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely. An attacker can craft malicious input that triggers the integer overflow when processed by the vulnerable library.
*   **Punycode Input:** The attack vector involves providing specially crafted Punycode input to an application using `libidn` or `libidn2`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send input:** The attacker needs to be able to send/provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable application and library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both `libidn` and `libidn2` libraries, requiring separate fixes.
*   The `libidn2` fix was discovered through fuzzing.
*   The vulnerability is specifically in the `decode_digit()` function related to Punycode handling.
*   Debian provided patches for oldstable (jessie), stable (stretch), testing (buster) and unstable(sid) distributions of the library.

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description, specifically identifying the vulnerable function (`decode_digit()`) and providing context around how the input is crafted.
