Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14801

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the Micro Focus Access Manager (NAM) Administration Console's REST API. Specifically, user-supplied input appended to the REST API URL parameters is reflected back in the page's error message.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts through the REST API URL parameters. Although the provided text indicates that the XSS is reflected without actual execution in the described situation, it does not exclude the possibility of execution. An attacker might exploit this to perform actions on behalf of a victim user, steal cookies, or redirect the user to malicious websites. The document states "Input xss can be appended into the REST API url parameters and reflected back into the page error message without actual xss injection execution", but this doesn't mean it's not exploitable.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By crafting a malicious URL that includes XSS payload within the REST API parameters and tricking a user into accessing it. This could be achieved through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker would need to craft a specific URL with malicious code and persuade a victim to load the URL in their browser while being logged into the vulnerable application.

**Affected Product:**

*   Micro Focus Access Manager (NAM) versions prior to 4.3 SP3.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the fix provided in Access Manager 4.3 SP3. The fix includes sanitization and validation of the input that are used to retrieve the requested information.
