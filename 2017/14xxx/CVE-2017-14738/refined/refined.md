Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14738:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Specifically, it is a blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `metafield` parameter within the search functionality of FileRun.
- The specific vulnerable code is in the `search` module, specifically when the `meta` search type is used within the `ajax` section and on the `grid` page.
- The vulnerability is exploitable even after authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, including the database name, by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, as demonstrated by the provided Python exploit.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests.
- Specifically, an attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the target URL, `http://<target_ip>/?module=search&section=ajax&page=grid`, with a malicious SQL query within the `metafield` parameter.
- The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, making use of the `SLEEP()` function to infer information based on the server's response time.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FileRun application to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the target URL and parameters to send the malicious request.
-  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FileRun application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit uses a time-based approach, meaning it infers database information by monitoring the response time.
- The provided exploit attempts to extract the database name, but the vulnerability could be used for other database manipulations or data exfiltration.
- The application version is specified as "FileRun <= 2017.09.18".
