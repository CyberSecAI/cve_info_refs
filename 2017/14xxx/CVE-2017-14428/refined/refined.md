  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Weak file permissions and credentials stored in cleartext",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cleartext storage of administrator password in `/var/passwd`",
    "Cleartext storage of administrator password in `/var/etc/hnapasswd`",
     "World-readable `/var/etc/passwd` (symlinked to `/etc/shadow`) containing a DES hash of the admin user's password.",
     "Cleartext storage of credentials in `/var/run/storage_account_root`",
    "Cleartext storage of wireless passphrase in `/var/run/hostapd*` files"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of sensitive information allowing unauthorized access to the router's web interface and potential further compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the router's filesystem.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the router, which can be achieved via a prior compromise of the router or physical access."
