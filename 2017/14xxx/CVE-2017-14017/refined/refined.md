Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14017

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application uses an uncontrolled search path, allowing an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL file that will be loaded by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The software searches for DLL files in locations that are not restricted or controlled by the application, enabling an attacker to place malicious DLL files in the search path.
*   **Unquoted Search Path or Element:**  Although not directly related to CVE-2017-14017, this document mentions a related issue (CVE-2017-14019) with an unquoted search path which allows for privilege escalation by a local user inserting malicious code into the unquoted service path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the uncontrolled search path vulnerability (CVE-2017-14017) allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code through a malicious DLL file.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** (Specifically for the related CVE-2017-14019) The unquoted search path vulnerability allows a local user to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote (CVE-2017-14017):** A remote attacker can exploit the uncontrolled search path vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through a malicious DLL file. The attacker would likely need to place this DLL in a location searched by the vulnerable application, this could include shared or network locations.
* **Local (CVE-2017-14019):** An authorized local user can exploit the unquoted search path vulnerability to escalate privileges by inserting malicious code into the service path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker (CVE-2017-14017):** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system. The required privilege level is high (PR:H) and user interaction is required (UI:R).
*   **Local User (CVE-2017-14019):** The attacker must have local access to the system with an account that has high privileges(PR:H) and user interaction is required (UI:R) .

**Additional Notes:**
* The document mentions that there is no public exploit specifically targeting these vulnerabilities.
* The document also recommends general security measures such as minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and using VPNs for remote access.
* Social engineering attacks should also be considered.

**CVSS Vector Strings:**
*   **CVE-2017-14017**: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
*   **CVE-2017-14019**: `AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

**Summary of CVE-2017-14017:** This CVE concerns an uncontrolled search path vulnerability in Progea Movicon SCADA/HMI software, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a directory searched by the application. This requires the attacker to have high privileges and user interaction is needed to be successful.
