The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Watchguard Fireware OS, but neither is related to CVE-2017-14615. The two vulnerabilities described are:

**1. XML-RPC Empty Member DoS**

*   **Root cause:**  The `wgagent` crashes when processing an XML-RPC login request containing an empty member tag within the XML structure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the crash of the `wgagent`.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Continuous execution of requests with empty member tags leads to the device being impossible to manage via the Web UI, effectively locking out users.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted XML-RPC login request to the `/agent/login` endpoint with an empty member tag.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the XML-RPC interface of the Fireware device.

**2. XML-RPC Username Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user input in the XML-RPC login endpoint. Specifically, when JavaScript code is embedded within the `user` tag of a failed login attempt, it gets stored and later rendered in the Web UI.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code injected through the `user` field executes in the context of other logged-in users when they visit the "Traffic Monitor" sections "Events" and "All" in the Web UI. This also prevents further events from being visible until the device is restarted.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted XML-RPC login request with malicious JavaScript code within the `user` tag to the `/agent/login` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the XML-RPC interface of the Fireware device.

Both vulnerabilities were found in Fireware OS versions below v12.0 and were fixed in version 12.0.
