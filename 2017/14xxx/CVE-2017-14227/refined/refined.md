{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because `bson_iter_codewscope()` calculates an incorrect string length (4294967295) and passes this wrong value to the `bson_utf8_validate()` function as the second argument `utf8_len`. The `bson_utf8_validate` function then uses this incorrect length, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow when accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted BSON document that results in an incorrect string length calculation by `bson_iter_codewscope()`",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious BSON document to a vulnerable application using the libbson library."
