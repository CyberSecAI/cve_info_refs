    "summary": "The provided content describes a race condition vulnerability in the postgresql init script that could allow a local attacker with access to the postgresql account to escalate their privileges to root. The vulnerability is triggered during the initialization of the postgresql database and is caused by a problematic use of the 'install' command in the init script. The attacker needs to be able to write to the postgresql data directory to create a symlink.",
