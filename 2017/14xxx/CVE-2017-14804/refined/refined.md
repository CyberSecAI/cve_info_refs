{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `build` package, specifically the `extractbuild` script, did not properly validate directory names during the extraction of build results. This allowed untrusted builds to write outside the intended target system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient directory name validation",
      "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could escape the buildroot and potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted build results",
	  "Exploiting the extractbuild script through manipulated directory names within build results."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker capable of creating and submitting builds to the system."
