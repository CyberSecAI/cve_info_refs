| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c0)  Florian Haas   2017-10-03 19:59:42 UTC  ``` User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/61.0.3163.79 Chrome/61.0.3163.79 Safari/537.36 Build Identifier:   I'm running Leap 42.3 in an LXC container (using a download image from images.linuxcontainers.org), and I can install osc just fine with "zypper in osc". However, all subsequent osc commands that try to access the build.opensuse.org API fail, because osc is unable to verify the TLS certs.  Installing ca-certificates* fixes the issue; osc should probably get that as an install dependency.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start a Leap 42.3 LXC container (I run on Ubuntu, and use "lxc-create -n <name> -t download -- --dist opensuse --release 42.3 --arch amd64"), and attach to it with lxc-attach. 2. Run "zypper in osc" as root. 3. Try "osc ls home:<name>" as a regular user. 4. Give your username and password, observe failure to verify CA cert. 5. Run "zypper in ca-certificates*" as root. 6. Retry step 4, which now succeeds. Actual Results:   osc is non-functional without manually installing the ca-certificates* packages.  Expected Results:   The osc package should have an installation dependency on the ca-certificates* packages, so that "zypper in osc" automatically installs those packages. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2017-10-04 08:59:04 UTC  ``` The osc devs say that this should be a "recommends", not a "requires". ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c2)  Florian Haas   2017-10-04 09:03:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andreas Stieger from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c1)) > The osc devs say that this should be a "recommends", not a "requires".  Hmmm... under what circumstances would osc ever *not* need certificate verification? If the answer is "none", then a hard requirement would seem more appropriate to me than a recommendation. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2017-10-04 09:06:31 UTC  ``` when using it against an OBS with an own CA or no SSL at all or if the user want's a different ca certificate package. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c4)  Florian Haas   2017-10-04 09:11:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c3)) > when using it against an OBS with an own CA or no SSL at all or if the user > want's a different ca certificate package.  Sounds reasonable — except the "no SSL at all" part :) — but maybe you want to add an additional error message to make this clearer to the user. Something like "Unable to verify certificate. Does your system have the correct CA certificate installed?"  Just my two cents, of course. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2017-10-04 10:01:31 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1061500) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/531114> Factory / osc ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c6)  Marco Strigl   2017-10-04 11:10:09 UTC  ``` > Reproducible: Always >  > Steps to Reproduce: > 1. Start a Leap 42.3 LXC container (I run on Ubuntu, and use "lxc-create -n > <name> -t download -- --dist opensuse --release 42.3 --arch amd64"), and > attach to it with lxc-attach. > 2.

Retry step 4, which now succeeds. > Actual Results:   > osc is non-functional without manually installing the ca-certificates* > packages. >   I can not reproduce this.

It's the responsibility of the base image to pull it in. Osc does not need to care. So whoever creates those lxc images should include ssl certificates there. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1061500#c8)  Florian Haas   2017-10-05 08:56:59 UTC  ``` OK, if you say so.

This can be used, for instance, to replace a running bs_worker with arbitrary code. The attached obs-build_extractbuild_exploit.txt file documents the exploit.
