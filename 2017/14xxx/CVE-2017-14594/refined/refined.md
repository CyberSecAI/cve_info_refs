- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `jqlQuery` parameter in the printable search request resource of Atlassian Jira is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user input provided through the `jqlQuery` parameter before displaying it in the printable search request, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser when they access the printable search request page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks by executing arbitrary code within the victim's browser session in the context of the vulnerable Jira instance.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a crafted `jqlQuery` parameter containing JavaScript code. When a user accesses this URL, the malicious script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated. They need the ability to craft a malicious link with the vulnerable parameter and lure the victim into clicking it or embedding the link on a web page.
