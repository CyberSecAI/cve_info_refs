- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mirasvit Helpdesk MX module fails to properly filter user input in multiple fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the administrator's browser session when they view the helpdesk tickets.
- **Attack vectors**: User-controlled input fields such as the customer name and ticket subject.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a user or submit a ticket using the vulnerable input fields in the Magento store. They do not need to be an administrator to trigger the XSS, but the script is executed when an administrator views the ticket details in the admin interface.
