  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'timeline' and 'id' GET parameters before using them in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the WordPress database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through HTTP GET requests to the 'admin-ajax.php' file, 'content_timeline_edit.php', and 'content_timeline_index.php' pages by using the 'timeline' and 'id' parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site and needs to be aware of the vulnerable plugin and how to craft malicious SQL queries."
