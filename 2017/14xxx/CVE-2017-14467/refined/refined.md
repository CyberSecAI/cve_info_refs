- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLC allows unauthenticated users to read and write to various files containing sensitive data and program logic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The PLC does not properly restrict access to files containing ladder logic, configuration data, and password information. This allows unauthenticated users to perform read and write operations using CIP encapsulated PCCC commands. Specifically, filetype 0x03 allows unauthenticated write access, allowing the master password to be overwritten.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **CVE-2017-14467:** An attacker can perform live rung edits to the ladder logic, allowing for addition, deletion, or modification of existing ladder logic. This can also trigger faults and CPU state modifications.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted, unauthenticated CIP encapsulated PCCC commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the PLC and the ability to send unauthenticated packets. No authentication is needed. The attacker needs to know the structure of the CIP/PCCC commands to exploit this vulnerability.
