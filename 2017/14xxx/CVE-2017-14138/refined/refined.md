Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14138:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ReadWEBPImage` function within the `webp.c` file of the ImageMagick library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A memory leak occurs when processing a crafted WEBP image, leading to the allocation of a large amount of memory (4294904328 bytes in the provided example) without releasing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive memory consumption. This can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted WEBP image file using ImageMagick's utilities (e.g., `identify`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or entice the victim into processing the crafted WEBP file using vulnerable versions of ImageMagick. This could be achieved through various means, such as a website or an email attachment.

**Additional details:**
- The github issue #639 provides a stack trace of the memory leak and a link to a proof-of-concept (POC) file.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201711-07) lists CVE-2017-14138 among other vulnerabilities affecting ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.9.20, further confirming that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a crafted file.
