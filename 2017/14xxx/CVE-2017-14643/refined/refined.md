  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-14643",
      "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AP4_BytesToUInt32BE` function within `Ap4Utils.h`. This function reads 4 bytes from a given memory location to convert it to a 32-bit unsigned integer. The vulnerability occurs when the provided memory region does not contain enough bytes to perform the read operation, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to an out-of-bounds read and potentially other security consequences such as arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of MP4 files. By providing a specially crafted MP4 file, an attacker can cause the vulnerable code to read beyond the allocated buffer.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file that triggers the vulnerability during parsing. No special privileges are required."
