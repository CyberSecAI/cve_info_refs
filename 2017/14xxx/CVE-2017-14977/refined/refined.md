Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `FoFiTrueType::getCFFBlock` function within the `FoFiTrueType.cc` file of the Poppler library.
*   The issue is a missing validation of a table pointer, specifically `tables[i]`, before accessing its `offset` and `len` members. If `seekTable("CFF ")` returns an invalid index, then `tables[i]` will be uninitialized and lead to dereferencing a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is a null pointer dereference. When the `tables` array is not properly initialized (likely due to an invalid table index returned from `seekTable`), accessing members like `tables[i].offset` or `tables[i].len` results in the program trying to read memory from address `0x0`, causing a crash.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability exists because the code does not check if the index `i` is valid before accessing the `tables` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to an application crash, rendering the Poppler library and any application using it unusable for processing the malicious PDF file. This constitutes a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The attack vector is a crafted PDF document. A malicious PDF can be created to trigger the uninitialized tables array access in the `FoFiTrueType::getCFFBlock` function.
*   **Processing the PDF:** The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses Poppler to process the crafted malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF document to a user/application that relies on the vulnerable Poppler library for PDF processing. No specific network or local system privileges are needed, other than the ability to supply a PDF to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs in the following code snippet in `FoFiTrueType.cc`:
```c++
GBool FoFiTrueType::getCFFBlock(char **start, int *length) {
    int i;
    if (!openTypeCFF) {
        return gFalse;
    }
    i = seekTable("CFF ");
    if (!checkRegion(tables[i].offset, tables[i].len)) {
        return gFalse;
    }
    *start = (char *)file + tables[i].offset;
    *length = tables[i].len;
    return gTrue;
}
```
* The vulnerability is triggered if `seekTable("CFF ")` returns an invalid index `i`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided bug report on freedesktop.org ([Bug 103045](show_bug.cgi?id=103045)) confirms the vulnerability and includes a proof-of-concept (POC) PDF file that triggers the crash. This report was also used as the basis for the fix.
* The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4079-1) confirms the CVE and states that the vulnerability can lead to "denial of service".
* The issue was fixed in poppler version `0.18.4-6+deb7u4` for Debian 7 "Wheezy", `0.26.5-2+deb8u2` for Debian "Jessie" and `0.48.0-2+deb9u1` for Debian "Stretch".
