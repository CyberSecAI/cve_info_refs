Package        : poppler
Version        : 0.18.4-6+deb7u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-14975 CVE-2017-14976 CVE-2017-14977
                 CVE-2017-15565
Debian Bug     : 879066 877952 877954 877957

It was discovered that poppler, a PDF rendering library, was affected
by several denial-of-service (application crash), null pointer
dereferences and heap-based buffer over-read bugs:

CVE-2017-14975
  The FoFiType1C::convertToType0 function in FoFiType1C.cc
  has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability because a data structure
  is not initialized, which allows an attacker to launch a denial of
  service attack.

CVE-2017-14976
  The FoFiType1C::convertToType0 function in FoFiType1C.cc
  has a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability if an out-of-bounds
  font dictionary index is encountered, which allows an attacker to
  launch a denial of service attack.

CVE-2017-14977
  The FoFiTrueType::getCFFBlock function in FoFiTrueType.cc
  has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability due to lack of validation
  of a table pointer, which allows an attacker to launch a denial of
  service attack.

CVE-2017-15565
  NULL Pointer Dereference exists in the GfxImageColorMap::getGrayLine()
  function in GfxState.cc via a crafted PDF document.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.18.4-6+deb7u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.
