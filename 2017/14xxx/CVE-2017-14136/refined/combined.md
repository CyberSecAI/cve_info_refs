# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

                 CVE-2018-5268 CVE-2018-5269

```
Early versions of opencv have problems while reading data, which might
result in either buffer overflows, out-of bounds errors or integer
overflows.
```

Further assertion errors might happen due to incorrect integer cast.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.9.1+dfsg-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your opencv packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
