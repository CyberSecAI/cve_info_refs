| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22204#c0)  skysider    2017-09-25 13:29:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10477](attachment.cgi?id=10477 "poc of integer overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10477&action=edit "poc of integer overflow") poc of integer overflow  When I run "nm-new -a -A -D -l -n -P -r -S --size-sort --special-syms --synthetic --with-symbol-versions integer_overflow.elf", it just hangs there and lasts for long time. And When I run ltrace with above command, I find that it call malloc persistly.  And then I debug it with gdb, I finall find the reason in function decode_line_info. Here is the snippet of it:   /* Decode the table.  */       while (! end_sequence) 	{ 	  op_code = read_1_byte (abfd, line_ptr, line_end); 	  line_ptr += 1;  	  if (op_code >= lh.opcode_base) 	    { 	      /* Special operand.  */ 	      adj_opcode = op_code - lh.opcode_base; 	      if (lh.line_range == 0) 		goto line_fail; 	      if (lh.maximum_ops_per_insn == 1) 		address += (adj_opcode / lh.line_range 			    * lh.minimum_instruction_length); 	      else 		{ 		  address += ((op_index + adj_opcode / lh.line_range) 			      / lh.maximum_ops_per_insn 			      * lh.minimum_instruction_length); 		  op_index = ((op_index + adj_opcode / lh.line_range) 			      % lh.maximum_ops_per_insn); 		} 2294:	      line += lh.line_base + (adj_opcode % lh.line_range); 	      /* Append row to matrix using current values.  */ 	      if (!add_line_info (table, address, op_index, filename, 				  line, column, discriminator, 0)) 		goto line_fail; 	      discriminator = 0; 	      if (address < low_pc) 		low_pc = address; 	      if (address > high_pc) 		high_pc = address; 	    }   When I debug the process, the lh.line_base=-5 (int type), while the line is declared a unsigned int with initial value 0, when it meets a specific condition, it just traps in the while loop.  The poc is attached. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22204#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2017-09-26 00:14:48 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Alan Modra <amodra@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=e338894dc2e603683bed2172e8e9f25b29051005>  commit e338894dc2e603683bed2172e8e9f25b29051005 Author: Alan Modra <amodra@gmail.com> Date:   Tue Sep 26 09:32:18 2017 +0930      [PR22204](show_bug.cgi?id=22204 "RESOLVED FIXED - Lack of DW_LNE_end_sequence causes \"infinite\" loop"), Lack of DW_LNE_end_sequence causes "infinite" loop          	[PR 22204](show_bug.cgi?id=22204 "RESOLVED FIXED - Lack of DW_LNE_end_sequence causes \"infinite\" loop")     	* dwarf2.c (decode_line_info): Ensure line_ptr stays within     	bounds in inner loop. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=22204#c2)  Alan Modra    2017-09-26 00:15:41 UTC  ``` Fixed ``` |  |
