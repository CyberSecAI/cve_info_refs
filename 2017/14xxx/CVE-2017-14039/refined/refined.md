Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-14039:

**Root Cause:**

*   A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function within the `t2.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when writing Start of Packet (SOP) and End of Packet Header (EPH) markers to the output buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Insufficient bounds checking:**  The code does not properly check if there is enough space remaining in the output buffer before writing the SOP and EPH markers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote code execution:** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Unspecified impacts:** Other unspecified impacts are also possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JPEG 2000 files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted JPEG 2000 (j2k) files, or by converting other formats to j2k (such as TIFF, PDF, or BMP).
*   **Specific encoding options:** The issue appears to be related to the use of the `-EPH` and `-SOP` options, along with the cinema2K profile, when encoding j2k files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by providing a malicious j2k file (or other format that is converted to j2k) to a vulnerable application that uses OpenJPEG.
*   **Ability to provide crafted input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted input file to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The overflow occurs at `t2.c:632:14` within the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function.
*   The issue is triggered when writing the SOP marker and EPH marker.
*   The provided AddressSanitizer output shows a write of size 1 at address `0x6080000000f4`, which is beyond the allocated region.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) file is provided at `<https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00322-openjpeg-heapoverflow-opj_t2_encode_packet>`.

**Fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by adding length checks before writing the SOP and EPH markers in the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function. The fix was released in commit `c535531f03369623b9b833ef41952c62257b507e`.
* The fix ensures that the output buffer has enough space remaining before writing the markers.
* OpenJPEG version 2.3.0 and later are not affected.

**Affected Versions:**

*   OpenJPEG versions prior to 2.3.0 are vulnerable. This includes the master branch at the time the bug was reported (2017-08-16).
*   Specifically, OpenJPEG 2.2.0 is affected.

**Mitigation:**
* Update to OpenJPEG 2.3.0 or later.

**CVE References:**

*   CVE-2017-14039 is the identifier for this vulnerability.
