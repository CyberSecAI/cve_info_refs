The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper Access Control: A local, non-administrator user has privileges to read and write to the file system of the target machine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) (Note: This is related to CVE-2017-14029, mentioned alongside CVE-2017-14031 in this advisory)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the improper access control vulnerability may allow a local, non-administrator user to read and write to the file system.
- Successful exploitation of the uncontrolled search path vulnerability (CVE-2017-14029) may allow execution of arbitrary code by placing specially crafted malicious DLL files on the target machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- For the improper access control vulnerability, the attack vector is local, requiring low privileges.
- For the uncontrolled search path vulnerability, the attack vector is local, requiring no privileges but requiring user interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the improper access control vulnerability, the attacker needs to be a local user with non-administrator privileges.
- For the uncontrolled search path vulnerability, the attacker needs local access to the machine and the user must interact to trigger the vulnerability.
