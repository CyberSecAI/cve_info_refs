**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The affected Korenix JetNet devices use hard-coded cryptographic keys and hard-coded credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):  Hard-coded certificates and private keys are used, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):  The software uses undocumented hard-coded credentials that may allow an attacker to gain remote access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to:
- Gain remote access to the device.
- Run arbitrary code.
- Perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote network attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote network access is required.
- Low skill level to exploit.
