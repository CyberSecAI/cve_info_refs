Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue #78, which is related to CVE-2017-14231

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in two logic bugs within the `register.php` file, coupled with insufficient input sanitization in `Type.class.php` and the lack of unique username checks before writing to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Password Comparison Error:** In `register.php` line 53, the code incorrectly compares the same password (`$_POST['pass1']`) against itself instead of comparing `$_POST['pass1']` and `$_POST['pass2']`. This likely means the code will not properly validate password confirmation and is not a security flaw.

2.  **Insufficient Input Sanitization and Username Duplication:** The `User::isExist` function in `User.class.php` uses `Typo::strip` to sanitize user input. The `Typo::strip` function in `Type.class.php` removes HTML tags using regular expressions. However, it only removes tags but doesn't prevent malicious usernames. If a user registers with a username like "admin<script>",  `Typo::strip` will return `admin`. Critically, the application does not check for duplicate usernames after the `strip` function is applied and before writing to the database. This leads to the ability to create multiple accounts with the same username and causes login issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this by creating multiple user accounts with the same username. This leads to login issues for legitimate users because the system cannot distinguish between users with the same name. An example of this is shown where the user "root" cannot log in because there are two "root" users with different groups. This effectively blocks a user's access to the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Registration:** The vulnerability can be exploited during the user registration process. An attacker registers with a username that, after stripping tags, matches an existing user.
*  **Username Manipulation**: An attacker can register a malicious username like `admin<script>` that will be stripped to `admin`. The system will not prevent this username from being registered and thus creating a duplicate user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker only needs the ability to register an account on the GeniXCMS application. No special privileges or access levels are required. The attacker should know the target user's name and manipulate their username so it is the same after tag stripping to block access to the target account.
