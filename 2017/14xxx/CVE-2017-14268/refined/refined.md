Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the EE 4GEE Wireless Router, specifically relating to CVE-2017-14268, as it is included in the list of vulnerabilities discussed:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SMS messages.

*   **Root Cause:** The `sms_content` parameter, returned to the application's SMS Inbox webpage via the `getSMSlist` POST request, lacks input validation and/or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within SMS messages.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the SMS message content, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's web browser when viewing the SMS message.
    *   **Device Control:** When chained with other vulnerabilities, such as CSRF, this can lead to total modification of the device settings, by sending an JavaScript XHR POST request to the "uploadSettings" web page containing binary configuration data.
    *   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal user cookies, device information, and SMS messages.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote SMS:** An attacker sends a specially crafted SMS message containing an XSS payload to the device. When the user views the SMS inbox on the router's admin panel, the malicious script executes.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote SMS access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SMS messages to the device's phone number.
    *   **Victim interaction (for some attacks):** The victim needs to access the SMS inbox within the router's admin panel for the injected script to execute, although this can be automated with the use of other vulnerabilities such as CSRF.
