Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-14080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the initialization of the users table in the `tmwf` database of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise. Specifically, the system fails to properly enforce password authentication when a user attempts to log in using their email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass: The system can bypass password authentication when logging in a user by email address. This allows an attacker to gain access to user accounts without knowing the password.
- Insecure initialization: The initialization process of the users table in the database is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can escalate their privileges to those of an authenticated user on the affected system.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the system.
- No authentication required: The attack can be performed without needing any pre-existing authentication credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise instance.
- The attacker does not need any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- A TippingPoint IPS filter (ID '28542') is available to protect against this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Offensive Security.
