- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an unquoted service path in the Moxa MXview software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software uses an unquoted search path, which allows an attacker to insert arbitrary code by placing a malicious executable in a path that is searched when the service starts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a local authorized user with file access to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A local authorized user with file system access can insert arbitrary code into the unquoted service path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local authorized user with file access to the target system.
