{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Weak file permissions and credentials stored in cleartext.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "World-readable files containing sensitive information such as admin passwords and wireless passphrases.",
     "Cleartext storage of credentials in multiple locations.",
    "`/var/passwd` contains credentials in cleartext.",
    "`/var/etc/hnapasswd` contains credentials in cleartext.",
    "`/etc/shadow` is world readable, revealing DES hashes of admin user.",
    "`/var/run/storage_account_root` contains credentials in cleartext.",
    "`/var/run/hostapd*` contains wireless passphrase in cleartext."

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including admin passwords and wireless passphrases, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the device and network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the router's file system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have local access to the file system to read the sensitive data. This could be achieved through prior exploitation of other vulnerabilities (like remote code execution) or through direct access to the device."
