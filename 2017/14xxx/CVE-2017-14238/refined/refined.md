The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14238. This commit addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Dolibarr, as described in the commit comment by user eldy:

**Vulnerabilities and Root Causes:**

1.  **SQL Injection**
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `menuId` parameter in `admin/menus/edit.php`. The code was directly using user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper escaping.
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in `admin/menus/edit.php`.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Attack vector:**  A malicious user could craft a specific `menuId` parameter in an HTTP request to inject malicious SQL queries.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root cause**: Lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of parameters like `CompanyName`, `CompanyAddress`, `CompanyZip`, `CompanyTown`, `Phone` in `admin/company.php` and the `Title` parameter in `admin/menus/edit.php`.
    *   **Vulnerability**: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities present in `admin/company.php` and `admin/menus/edit.php`.
    *   **Impact**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the pages, which would then be executed by other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack vector:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable parameters via an HTTP request.

3.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure**
    *   **Root cause**: The `document.php` script did not properly sanitize the `file` parameter. It was using `original_file` which could lead to path traversal and thus reveal sensitive files.
    *  **Vulnerability**: Directory traversal vulnerability in the `document.php` file.
    *   **Impact**: An attacker could access arbitrary files within the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Attack vector**:  An attacker could craft a specific `file` parameter with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access unauthorized files.

**Code Changes:**

The commit includes changes to the following files:
*   `htdocs/admin/company.php`: Sanitization added for the Company parameters prone to XSS.
*   `htdocs/admin/menus/edit.php`: Sanitization of `menuId` to prevent SQL injection and `Title` to prevent XSS. Input validation using `GETPOST` function was added, which escapes special characters.
*   `htdocs/core/lib/functions.lib.php`: Added a less verbose error message.
*   `htdocs/document.php`: Fixed path traversal by using full path to file and improved file handling.
*   `htdocs/langs/en_US/main.lang`: updated language file with new messages
*   `htdocs/main.inc.php`: Updated regex to detect SQL injection and XSS.
*   `htdocs/viewimage.php`: No changes were made in this file but its mentioned in the commit description.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Dolibarr application.
*   For SQL injection and XSS, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP GET or POST parameters.
*   For the sensitive information disclosure, the attacker needs to know the path structure of the Dolibarr system.

In summary, the commit addresses SQL injection, multiple XSS vulnerabilities and sensitive information disclosure due to insufficient input sanitization. The commit prevents the use of unsanitized user input from being used directly in SQL queries or output, effectively mitigating the risk of these attacks.
