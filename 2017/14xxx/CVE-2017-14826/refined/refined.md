  "CVE-2017-14826": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-14826",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the formNodes method of XFA Node objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from a type confusion error within the `formNodes` method of XFA Node objects due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Type Confusion",
        "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution under the context of the current process.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious webpage",
        "Opening a malicious PDF file"
      ],
       "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document that exploits the vulnerability. User interaction is required, so the victim has to open the PDF."
