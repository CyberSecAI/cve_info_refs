The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Arris modems distributed by AT&T. The vulnerabilities are in the NVG589 and NVG599 modem models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **NVG589 and NVG599 modems:**
    *   Firmware update 9.2.2h0d83 enables SSH by default.
    *   Hardcoded credentials exist that allow access to the cshell service.
    *   The cshell binary runs as root, meaning command injection or buffer overflow vulnerabilities lead to root access.
*   **NVG599 caserver HTTPS server (port 49955):**
    *   Default credentials for the caserver are present.
    *   Command injection vulnerability in the web server allows uploading of custom firmware and modifying the SDB database.
*   **Information Disclosure Vulnerability (port 61001):**
    *   A service on port 61001 leaks information, but requires knowledge of the device serial number.
*   **Firewall Bypass (port 49152):**
    *   A service on port 49152 allows remote access due to a predictable three-byte value followed by the MAC address, this bypasses firewall protections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Hardcoded credentials
*   Default enabled SSH service
*   Command injection vulnerability
*   Buffer overflow vulnerability potential
*   Information disclosure vulnerability
*   Firewall bypass vulnerability
*   Lack of certificate pinning

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Full control of the device as root (via cshell).
    *   View or change Wi-Fi SSID or password.
    *   Modify network configurations.
    *   Reflash firmware from an internet file.
    *   Control a kernel module that injects ads into unencrypted traffic.
*   Ability to form botnets by compromising the devices
*   Run code to inject ads into traffic
*   Exploit other vulnerabilities on devices connected to the local network
*   Force a victim's browser to accept a certificate from the gateway, enabling full traffic control.
*   Upload custom firmware.
*   Access or change the internal SDB database configuration.
*   Remote access to the device.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote access via SSH using hardcoded credentials.
*   Remote access via the webserver command injection vulnerability
*   Remote access via port 49152 firewall bypass using a predictable three-byte value followed by the MAC address
*   Local access to the cshell service

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Remote access to the device network for most vulnerabilities, local network access for cshell access
*   Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials for the device.
*   Knowledge of the predictable three-byte value and MAC address for firewall bypass
*   Knowledge of the device serial number for the information disclosure vulnerability.
