| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-13 04:32:53 UTC  ``` Improper validation of the file_path argument in t_go_generator.cc:format_go_output() of the Apache Thrift Go client library can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.   The file_path parameter is derived from the service name. If an attacker can provide a service name to a framework invoking Thrift, the attacker could craft the name in a way leading to arbitrary commands being executed.  This affects versions before Apache Thrift 0.10.0.   Upstream Advisory:  <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/thrift-user/201701.mbox/%3CCANyrgvc3W%3DMJ9S-hMZecPNzxkyfgNmuSgVfW2hdDSz5ke%2BOPhQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E>   Upstream Issue:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-3893>   Upstream Commit:  <https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/2007783e874d524a46b818598a45078448ecc53e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-13 04:33:31 UTC  ``` Created thrift tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1544621](show_bug.cgi?id=1544621 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-5397 thrift: Improper file path sanitization in t_go_generator.cc:format_go_output() of the go client library can allow an attacker to inject commands [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-27 00:45:23 UTC  ``` Marking openshift-enterprise-3 and openshift-1 as not affected. Thrift is available in the rhel-7-server-ose-3.{4-5}-rpms repository, as a dependency of python-elasticsearch. The python-elasticsearch rpm includes Elasticsearch 2.3.0-1. However the elasticsearch hasn't ben required by the thrift libraries since version 1.8.0.   This issue was created to track removal of python-thrift dependency from python-elasticsearch rpm:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560778](show_bug.cgi?id=1560778 "CLOSED DEFERRED - python-elasticsearch spec file requires python-thrift. However it's not used by elasticsearch since version 1.8.0")   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c6)  Kunjan Rathod    2018-04-19 00:46:38 UTC  ``` Marking JON-3 as not affected as the Thrift API's has never been used in Cassandra(Shipped with JON) and hence the Thrift server is disabled.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c9)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-09 08:02:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  libthrift is a library used by OpenDaylight which is shipped with Red Hat OpenStack. Whilst the version of the library used contains the vulnerable code it is not used by OpenDaylight and hence not exposed.  JBoss fuse 6.3 ships libthrift via insight-activemq fabric-8 profile, however the vulnerable code is not used by fabric-8 so fuse 6.3 is not affected.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-11 07:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2018:2669 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2669](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2669)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-17 14:54:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8  Via RHSA-2019:3140 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3140](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3140)   ``` |  |

## Description

[![@slandelle](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/849197?v=4&size=48)](/slandelle)[slandelle](https://github.com/slandelle)opened [on Aug 28, 2017](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1455#issue-253264461)

Issue is very similar to [CVE-2016-8624](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6pj7-p5f2-4p6f "CVE-2016-8624") that [affected cURL last year](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102J.html).

AHC url parser, `org.asynchttpclient.uri.Uri` can be tricked with a anchor containing a question mark into connecting to a different host. This issue also affects `java.net.URL` (as of 8u112) but not `java.net.URI`:

```
org.asynchttpclient.uri.Uri.create("http://1.2.3.4:81#@5.6.7.8:82/aaa/b?q").getHost()
// 5.6.7.8

new java.net.URL("http://1.2.3.4:81#@5.6.7.8:82/aaa/b?q").getHost()
// 5.6.7.8

java.net.URI.create("http://1.2.3.4:81#@5.6.7.8:82/aaa/b?q").getHost()
// 1.2.3.4
```

Credit goes to Nicolas Grégoire from [Agarri](http://www.agarri.fr).

I'm not aware of any exploit at the moment.

Possible usages:

* circumventing white/back lists
* web crawler that would use AHC for fetching pages but would use `java.net.URI` to compute the index key.

Subject: CVE request: incorrect URL parsing in async-http-client <= 2.0.35

Hello,

a flaw was identified in the URL parsing code of async-http-client, a
Java HTTP client used in other projects like the Play Framework
(through its WS library):
<https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/JavaWS>

The bug is similar to CVE-2016-8624 affecting cURL (incorrect
processing of string "#@" in the hostname):
<https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102J.html>

Version 2.0.35 of async-http-client includes a fix and is available
through Maven since Monday. Relevant GitHub issue:
<https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1455>

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire
