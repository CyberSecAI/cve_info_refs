  "cve": "CVE-2017-14063",
  "description": "Async Http Client (aka async-http-client) before 2.0.35 can be tricked into connecting to a host different from the one extracted by java.net.URI if a '?' character occurs in a fragment identifier. Similar bugs were previously identified in cURL (CVE-2016-8624) and Oracle Java 8 java.net.URL.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Red Hat Fuse"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The async-http-client's URL parser (`org.asynchttpclient.uri.Uri`) incorrectly parses URLs when a '?' character is present within the fragment identifier (the part after `#`). This leads to the client connecting to a different host than intended by the java.net.URI parsing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper URL parsing",
       "Inconsistent URL parsing between AHC and java.net.URI"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially bypass whitelists/blacklists, or redirect web crawlers that rely on AHC to malicious locations by crafting a URL with a malicious host in the fragment identifier.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a URL that includes a question mark ('?') within the fragment identifier to manipulate the host the client connects to.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the URL that is processed by the vulnerable application using the async-http-client.",
     "additional_info": "This issue is similar to CVE-2016-8624 that affected cURL, and also affects java.net.URL. java.net.URI is not vulnerable."
