## Kaltura Video Platform - Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution (and XSS)

12 Sep 2017

During an interal pentest several critical vulnerabilities could be identified
in the latest version of [Kaltura Community and Enterprise](https://kaltura.com).
The vulnerabilities were fixed in the latest release 13.2.0.

**Update:** A proof of concept exploit can be found [here](/assets/exploits/kaltura_rce_poc_2017-14143.py).

     Advisory: Kaltura - Remote Code Execution and Cross-Site Scripting
 Release Date: 2017/09/12
       Author: Robin Verton (robin.verton@telekom.de)
          CVE: CVE-2017-14141, CVE-2017-14142, CVE-2017-14143

  Application: Kaltura <= 13.1.0
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Kaltura 13.2.0 was released to fix this vulnerabilities.

Overview:

  Quote from Wikipedia:
  "Kaltura is a New York-based software company founded in 2006. Kaltura states
   that its mission is to power any video experience. Kaltura operates in four
   major markets for video based solutions: Cloud TV (AKA OTT TV) for operators
   and media companies, OVP (Online Video Platform) offered mostly to media
   companies and brands looking to distribute content or monetize it, EdVP
   (Education Video Platform) offered to educational institutions who are
   increasingly relying on video as for teaching and learning, and EVP
   (Enterprise Video Platform) offered to enterprises who use video for
   collaboration, communications and marketing."

  Kaltura is installed on a lot of high profiles website like banking websites,
  universities, manufacturers, multimedia corporations etc.

  Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in the current release of the
  Kaltura Video platform. It was discovered that Kaltura passes unfiltered user
  input to unserialize(), leading to the execution of PHP code. One of this
  vulnerabilities can also be triggered unauthenticated. Several other
  Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities were found.

Details:

  1) Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution through unserialize() from cookie data

    Because of a hardcoded cookie secret, the cookie signature validation can
    be bypassed and malicious user input can be passed via the 'userzone' cookie
    to the unserialize() function:

    abstract class kalturaAction extends sfAction
    {
        private $cookieSecret = 'y3tAno3therS$cr3T';

        // [...]

        protected function getUserzoneCookie()
        {
            $cookie = $this->getContext()->getRequest()->getCookie('userzone');
            $length = strlen($cookie);
            if ($length <= 0)
                return null;

            $serialized_data = substr($cookie, 0, $length - 32);
            $hash_signiture = substr($cookie, $length - 32);

            // check the signiture
            if (md5($serialized_data . $this->cookieSecret) != $hash_signiture)
                return null;

            $userzone_data = unserialize(base64_decode($serialized_data));

    To pass this validation the base64 encoded serialized object has to be
    hashed and this hash appended to the encoded data. A Zend Framework POP
    chain [1] can then be used to execute PHP code when unserializing. When
    using PHP7 a different chain has to be used because the e-modifier for
    preg_replace is not available anymore.

    To execute the getUserzoneCookie() function the getAllEntriesAction has to
    be called with a valid entry ID. This ID can be obtained from any public
    video object which is embedded and typically begins with '0_'.

  2) Authenticated Remote Code Execution through unserialize() in the admin panel

    The admin panel provides a few 'Developer System Helper' functions to
    encode/decode user supplied data. The 'wiki_decode' function will take user
    input and pass it nearly untouched to unserialize():

    // slightly formatted for better readability
    if ( $algo == "wiki_encode" )
	{
		$res = str_replace(
            array ( "|" , "/") , array ("|01" , "|02"),
            base64_encode(serialize($str))
        );
	}

    By passing a base64 encoded malicious serialized object, PHP code can be
    executed.

  3) Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities under the API path

    A few cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found earlier this year and
    fixed [2]. However, this fix was insufficient because PHPs strip_tags()
    function only strips tags and is not adequate to secure against XSS
    vulnerabilities. There are a few places where this can be exploited to
    inject javascript code:

    // server/admin_console/web/tools/bigRedButton.php, line 8
    $partnerId = strip_tags($_GET['partnerId']);

    // [...]

    <script>
		var partnerId = <?php echo $partnerId; ?>;

    As can be seen above no tags need to be inserted here to execute javascript
    code. A simple partnerId=alert(1) will be executed in this scenario. This
    also affects a few other files.

    server/admin_console/web/tools/bigRedButton.php
        - $_GET['partnerId']
        - $_GET['playerVersion']

    server/admin_console/web/tools/bigRedButtonPtsPoc.php
        - $_GET['partnerId']
        - $_GET['playerVersion']
        - $_GET['secret']
        - $_GET['entryId']
        - $_GET['adminUiConfId']
        - $_GET['uiConfId']

    server/admin_console/web/tools/AkamaiBroadcaster.php
        - $_GET['streamUsername']
        - $_GET['streamPassword']
        - $_GET['streamRemoteId']
        - $_GET['streamRemoteBackupId']
        - $_GET['entryId']

    server/admin_console/web/tools/XmlJWPlayer.php
        - $_GET['entryId']

    server/alpha/web/lib/bigRedButtonPtsPocHlsjs.php
        - $_GET['partnerId']
        - $_GET['playerVersion']

Additional notes:

  The already published Server Side Request Forgery attack [3] was not fixed
  properly, because only an additional check for the http(s) protocol was added.
  This still allows to talk to some backend services (like the memcached) or
  other machines. There is a whitelist in place to make this more secure, but I
  could not find a way how to set this up. This is likely responsible for a
  lot of insecure default installations of Kaltura in the wild.

        This module exploits an Object Injection vulnerability in Kaltura.
        By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute
        arbitrary code under the context of the web server user.

        Kaltura makes use of a hardcoded cookie secret which allows to sign
        arbitrary cookie data. After passing this signature check, the base64-
        decoded data is passed to PHPs unserialize() function which allows for
        code execution. The constructed object is again based on the SektionEins
        Zend code execution POP chain PoC. Kaltura versions prior to 13.1.0 are
        affected by this issue.

        A valid entry_id (which is required for this exploit) can be obtained
        from any media resource published on the kaltura installation.

        This module was tested against Kaltura 13.1.0-2 installed on Ubuntu 14.04.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
