  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-14143",
      "root_cause": "The application passes unfiltered user input to the `unserialize()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data.",
		"Hardcoded cookie secret."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) under the context of the web server user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object, base64 encoding it, signing it with a hardcoded cookie secret, and sending it via the 'userzone' cookie. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.",
        "By using the 'wiki_decode' function in the admin panel with a base64 encoded malicious serialized object"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized PHP object and know the hardcoded cookie secret 'y3tAno3therS$cr3T'. For the unauthenticated RCE via cookie, the attacker also requires a valid entry ID, obtainable from any public video object, typically starting with '0_'. For the RCE in the admin panel, access to the admin panel is required."

   "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is present in Kaltura versions prior to 13.2.0.",
        "The vulnerability allows for Object Injection in PHP.",
