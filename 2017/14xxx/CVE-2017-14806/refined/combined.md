| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065397#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2017-10-27 07:33:40 UTC  ``` Due to  sid/getfile-gem/ext/getfile/getfile.c  :  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0); certificates are not checked. This allows to MITM connections to the repositories.  Once in a MITM position the repodata can be modified since the gpg signature isn't verified. The packages are only checked for their checksum specified in the repo meta data, the gpg signature on the packages is not checked:     def install_cmds packages       packages.map do |repo_descriptor, packages|         repo = (repo_descriptor == "general" ? nil : repo_descriptor)         cmd = [           "sudo",           "zypper",           "-vvv",           "-n" ,           "--no-gpg-checks",           "install",           "--auto-agree-with-licenses",           ("--from" if repo),  this makes it easy to get malicious packages installed. I was able to MITM a connection while building an appliance and get a modified rpm installed without any warning. ``` |  |
