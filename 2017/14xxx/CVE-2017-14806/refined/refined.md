{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application disables SSL certificate verification when communicating with repositories and does not verify GPG signatures on repository metadata. Additionally, the application does not verify GPG signatures on packages, only their checksums specified in the repo metadata.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of SSL certificates (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER set to 0)",
      "Missing verification of GPG signatures for repository metadata",
      "Missing verification of GPG signatures for packages"
    ],
    "impact": "A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker can modify repository metadata and inject malicious packages during installation. The application will install these packages without any warning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection between the application and the repositories"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the application and the repository servers."
