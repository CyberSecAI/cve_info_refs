Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the way Emacs handles "enriched mode" text, specifically the `x-display` extension command. This command allows the storage of "display" text properties, and within the `x-display` tag, arbitrary Lisp code can be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Handling of Enriched Text:** The `enriched-decode-display-prop` function in `enriched.el` allows for the execution of arbitrary Lisp code embedded within the `x-display` tag's parameters.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the injection and execution of arbitrary commands through specially crafted `text/enriched` MIME data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By opening a specially crafted file containing the malicious `x-display` tag, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the Emacs user. This could lead to full system compromise if Emacs is running with elevated permissions.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely via emails, news articles, or other methods of delivering the malicious `text/enriched` file to the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MIME Data:**  Attackers can embed malicious code within `text/enriched` MIME data (e.g., in emails or files).
*   **File Opening:**  The attack is triggered when a user opens a file or email using Emacs, and the vulnerable code is executed when the crafted display properties are processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious `text/enriched` file/MIME message:** The attacker needs the knowledge to create the file that exploits the command injection.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to open the crafted file or email in Emacs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Charles A. Roelli.
*   The issue affects multiple versions of Emacs, including 25.1, 23.1, 21.4, 23.2, 21.2, 22.3, 24.3, 21.1, 21.3, 24.1, 24.5, 25.2, 24.2, 23.4, 22.1, 23.3, 24.4 and 22.2.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Emacs version 25.3 (and corresponding patches in older versions in different distributions) by disabling the display property or by introducing a new `disable-eval` display property.
*   Several vendors, including Red Hat and Debian, released security advisories and patches to address this vulnerability.
*   A workaround involves disabling `enriched-decode-display-prop` or disabling enriched mode.
*   The vulnerability was introduced around 21.1 when the `x-display` functionality was implemented.
