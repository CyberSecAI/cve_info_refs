Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ReadWEBPImage` function within ImageMagick, specifically in how it calculates and allocates memory for processing WebP images. The size of the memory allocation is determined by a value read directly from the input file (`length = (size_t)(ReadWebPLSBWord(header+4) + 8)`).  This length is used in `AcquireQuantumMemory` to allocate a buffer `stream`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `length` variable, directly derived from the input file, can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows them to specify an arbitrarily large value, potentially exceeding available memory.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** There appears to be no adequate check on the `length` value to ensure it's within reasonable limits before allocating memory. While there's a check to ensure `length` is not less than 12, there's no upper bound.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a malicious WebP image file with an extremely large length value, an attacker can force ImageMagick to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory. This leads to memory exhaustion, causing the process to crash and denying service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious WebP Image:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted WebP image file. The attacker would manipulate the relevant bytes in the image to specify a very large allocation size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide the malicious image as input to ImageMagick:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted WebP image to a system or application using ImageMagick for processing. This could be through file upload, email attachment, or any other method that would cause ImageMagick to process the malicious file.
- **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability is exploitable simply by providing a maliciously crafted image, so no special privileges are needed to trigger it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue description on GitHub includes the line `length can be from 0 to 4G, this will cause memory exhausted on some condition even if the webp image file is very small`, which highlights the arbitrary size of the allocation.
- The Gentoo security advisory lists this CVE along with other ImageMagick vulnerabilities and states the impact as being able to "cause a Denial of Service condition".
