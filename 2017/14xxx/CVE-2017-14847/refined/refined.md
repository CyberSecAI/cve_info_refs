Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14847 (as indicated in the content and confirmed by the CVE link)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the WPAMS (Apartment Management System) WordPress plugin. The vulnerability arises because the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including table names, user data, passwords, and other application-specific data.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker can potentially modify, add, or delete data in the database.
- **Full Database Compromise:** In severe cases, depending on database permissions, an attacker might gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the WordPress pluginâ€™s message view functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a "student member" of the system. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible to authenticated users of the application, but not necessarily external or unauthenticated users.
- The attacker needs to have access to the message viewing functionality within the application, specifically the part that takes the `id` parameter.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection is required to craft the malicious SQL payload.
