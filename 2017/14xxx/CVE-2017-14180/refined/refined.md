Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Apport's flawed method of detecting if a crashed process originated from within a container or PID namespace. Apport incorrectly relies on a simple comparison of the global PID and local PID of a crashed process. This check fails to account for nested PID namespaces within a container, where a second PID namespace can exist, causing Apport to read from the wrong `/proc` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Container Detection:** Apport incorrectly determines if a process originated in a container by comparing global and local PIDs, which is insufficient and can lead to misidentification when nested PID namespaces are involved.
*   **Incorrect `/proc` Access:** Due to the flawed detection, Apport may access the wrong `/proc` directory, reading information from the container's `/proc` instead of the nested PID namespace where the crashed process originated.
*   **Privilege Escalation/Container Escape**: Because Apport is reading from the wrong /proc directory, it can be tricked into creating crash reports as root with incorrect information, which can be leveraged for privilege escalation or container escape.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Container Escape:** An attacker within a container can potentially escape the container and gain access to the host system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can achieve root privileges on the host or container OS.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting resources (e.g., by generating a large number of core dump files)
*  **Incorrect crash reporting:** Apport creates a crash report containing information from the wrong /proc directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability on a system or within a container.
*   **Exploitation of Nested PID Namespaces:** An attacker can create a nested PID namespace within a container and cause a crash, triggering Apport to handle it incorrectly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system (or a container) where Apport is running.
*   **Ability to Create Namespaces:** The attacker needs the ability to create a nested PID namespace and trigger a crash within it.
*  **Knowledge of Apport behavior:** Attacker needs to understand how Apport handles crashes and how it is triggered

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 17.04, and 17.10.
*  The issue is caused by insufficient checks in the Apport code when handling processes in PID namespaces.
*   The fix involves changing the container detection code to compare the inode of `/proc/<ns0 pid>/ns/pid` with `/proc/self/ns/pid`. If the inodes don't match, the process is considered to be in a different pid namespace.
*  The fix also involves sending a ucred over a Unix socket to the container's Apport instance so that the kernel can translate the pid to its correct value within the namespace it is being handled.
*  A temporary workaround for this issue was to disable container support in Apport.
