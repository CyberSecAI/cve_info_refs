Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613):** The user's session remains active for an extended period after their last activity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The application does not properly invalidate user sessions after a period of inactivity. This leads to sessions remaining active longer than necessary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially reuse an old, valid session to gain unauthorized access to the application. This could allow them to bypass protection mechanisms, assume the identity of an authenticated user and potentially modify device configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attack. An attacker could potentially intercept or obtain an old session and reuse it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to obtain a valid, but expired, session token. This could be achieved through network interception or gaining access to a user's machine. No user interaction is required (UI:N)
*   The attacker does not need to have any privileges (PR:N) or be authenticated.

**CVSS v3 Metrics:**
*   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.6
*   **CVSS v3 Vector String:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected product is the ProMinent MultiFLEX M10a Controller, specifically the web interface.
*   The advisory mentions that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
