{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses Java deserialization on untrusted data, specifically the `com.branaghgroup.ecers.update.UpdateRequest` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server hosting the ERS Data System.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker intercepts the unencrypted HTTP communication between the ERS Data System thick client and the server. By spoofing DNS to redirect the client's requests to a malicious server, the attacker can then send back a crafted serialized Java object, exploiting the deserialization vulnerability when the client processes the response.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by poisoning DNS and redirecting traffic to a server under their control. Additionally, the attacker needs to create malicious serialized java objects using tools like ysoserial."
