- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the history archiver service of FactoryTalk Alarms and Events.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly validate input, allowing an attacker to send specially crafted packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the history archiver service may stall or terminate.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, via a network connection to the affected device. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets to TCP port 403.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires remote network access to the system running FactoryTalk Alarms and Events. No authentication is required.
