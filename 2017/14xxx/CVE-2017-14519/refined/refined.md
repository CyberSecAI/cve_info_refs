Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Object::streamGetChar()` function within the Poppler library. It's triggered when processing a malformed PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. This is evident from the crash logs that show the program receiving a `SIGSEGV` (Segmentation Fault).
- The crash occurs when the code calls `stream->getChar()` which likely is a pointer that isn't valid and causes a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided crash logs clearly indicate a crash in the `pdftoppm` utility when processing a malicious PDF, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the advisory mentions "the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is processed", which indicates that if the memory corruption is controlled by an attacker, arbitrary code execution could be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted, malformed PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick a user into processing a malicious PDF file with a vulnerable version of poppler.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Function:** The vulnerable code is in `Object::streamGetChar()` which calls `stream->getChar()`
- **Affected Tool:** The bug report demonstrates the crash using `pdftoppm`, a utility within the poppler suite.
- **Crash Details:** The provided crash report shows a segmentation fault in `Object::streamGetChar`, indicating an attempt to access an invalid memory location.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was fixed in poppler and the fix is available in the versions specified by Debian.
- **Duplicate:** Bug 102718 was marked as a duplicate of this bug.
