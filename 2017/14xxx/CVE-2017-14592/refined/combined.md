From version 1.4.0 of Sourcetree for macOS, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 1.0b2 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5243>.

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit **Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant** for reporting this issue to us.

### **Sourcetree for Windows -**Various argument and command injection issues **(CVE-2017-14593)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

Sourcetree for Windows had several argument and command injection bugs in Mercurial and Git repository handling. An attacker with permission to commit to a repository linked in Sourcetree for Windows is able to exploit this issue to gain code execution on the system.

From version 0.8.4b of Sourcetree for Windows, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 0.5.1.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8256>.

### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows - Mercurial: arbitrary command execution in mercurial repositories with a git submodule  (CVE-2017-17458)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Mercurial** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows was vulnerable to[CVE-2017-17458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17458). An attacker can exploit this issue if they commit to a Mercurial repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a git subrepository specifying **arbitrary code** in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. Sourcetree for macOS and Sourcetree for Windows perform background indexing, which allows for this issue to be exploited without a user needing to directly interact with the git subrepository.

From version 1.4.0 of Sourcetree for macOS and 0.8.4b of Sourcetree for Windows, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 1.0b2 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5244>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 0.5.1.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8257>.

#### Acknowledgements

Atlassian would like to credit **Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant** for reporting this issue to us.

### **Sourcetree for macOS and Windows****- Git LFS: Arbitrary command execution in repositories with Git LFS enabled (CVE-2017-17831)**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate, or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

The embedded version of **Git LFS** used in Sourcetree for macOS and Windows was vulnerable to CVE-2017-17831. An attacker can exploit this issue if they can commit to a git repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows by adding a .lfsconfig file containing a malicious lfs url. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS or Sourcetree for Windows. This vulnerability can also be triggered from a web page through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler.

Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 2.1 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at  <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-5246>.

Versions of Sourcetree for Windows starting with 1.7.0 before version 2.4.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8261>.

### **What You Need to Do**

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) of Sourcetree:

* To version 2.7.0 or higher for macOS.  **NOTE**: Mac OSX 10.11 or later is requred for Sourcetree 2.5.0 or later.
* To version 2.4.7.0 or higher for Windows **and** manually uninstall any older versions of Sourcetree.
