Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the GridGain Visor GUI Management Console not properly sanitizing user-supplied file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application uses a user-provided path to access log files on remote cluster nodes without validation. This allows an attacker to potentially access any file on the server's file system accessible to the user running the GridGain node.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can read restricted or sensitive files stored on the server's file system. This could include configuration files, database credentials, private keys, and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Path Input:** The attacker provides a specially crafted file path through the Visor GUI console. This path might contain ".." sequences or absolute paths that allow the attacker to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user of the GridGain Visor GUI Management Console.
*   The attacker needs to have a connection to a GridGain cluster with vulnerable versions installed.
*   The attacker needs the ability to input the malicious path via the Visor GUI console.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
CVE-2017-14614 describes a path traversal vulnerability in the GridGain Visor GUI Management Console. Due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied file paths, an attacker with access to the Visor GUI console could potentially read arbitrary files on the remote server by manipulating the file path input when accessing remote log files.

**Mitigation:**
The provided mitigation strategies are:
1.  Start the cluster nodes under a system user with restricted file system access.
2.  Utilize GridGainâ€™s Security module to set up authentication and authorization parameters.
3.  Upgrade to a patched version of GridGain. Specifically:
    *   GridGain 8.1.5 or later
    *   GridGain 1.9.7 or later
    *   GridGain 1.8.12 or later
    *   GridGain 1.7.16 or later
