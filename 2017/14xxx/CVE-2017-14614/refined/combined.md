# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: [CVE-2017-14614] GridGain Visor GUI Console - File System Path
 Traversal

Severity: Important

 Vendor: GridGain Systems

 Versions Affected:

 * GridGain 8.1.4 and earlier
 * GridGain 1.9.6 and earlier
 * GridGain 1.8.11 and earlier
 * GridGain 1.7.15 and earlier

 Impact:
   The vulnerability impacts GridGain Visor GUI Management Console users. Visor allows open log files of remote cluster nodes and observe them locally. To get the logs a user needs to provide a path to the files. Visor does not sanitize the path provided that might result in an unauthorized access to sensitive files.

 Description:
   Visor GUI Console uses a user-supplied input to construct a pathname to a remote directory with log files. The application does not sanitize this path and malicious application users can get an access to restricted or sensitive files stored on a server’s file system.

 Mitigation:

 Start cluster nodes under a system user that has restricted access to the file system.
 In addition, to make the cluster more secure consider using GridGain’s Security module setting up basic authentication and authorization parameters.

 Upgrade to the versions below to enable the path sanitization by default:
 * GridGain 8.1.5 or later
 * GridGain 1.9.7 or later
 * GridGain 1.8.12 or later
 * GridGain 1.7.16 or later
