- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input validation and sanitization on file uploads and user-provided data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unrestricted file upload: Allows uploading any file type without validation, including potentially malicious executable files. Files are stored without extensions.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input for customer names and ticket subjects is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can upload a malicious file, including an executable, which when downloaded and executed by an administrator leads to arbitrary code execution.
    - XSS: Malicious scripts can be injected and executed in the administrator's browser when viewing customer names or ticket subjects, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - File Upload: Attacker uploads a malicious file through the helpdesk module.
    - XSS: Attacker crafts malicious input when creating a user or submitting a ticket.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - File Upload: Requires access to the helpdesk's file upload functionality.
    - XSS: Requires the ability to create users or submit helpdesk tickets and knowledge that the data will be rendered in an admin interface.
