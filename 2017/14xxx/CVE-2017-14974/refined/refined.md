The content is related to CVE-2017-14974.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the `elf_x86_64_get_synthetic_symtab` function within `elf64-x86-64.c` of binutils version 2.29.1. This is caused by the `bfd_canonicalize_dynamic_reloc` function returning 0 without proper handling, leading to the null pointer dereference when the return value is used without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code fails to check the return value of `bfd_canonicalize_dynamic_reloc` before using it, leading to a dereference of a null pointer if it returns 0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash of the `objdump` utility when processing a specially crafted ELF file. This can cause a denial of service when a user attempts to analyze the file using `objdump`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted ELF file.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious ELF file to `objdump`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted ELF file to `objdump`.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.
