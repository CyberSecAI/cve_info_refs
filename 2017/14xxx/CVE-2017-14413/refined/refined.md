Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14413:

**1. Verification:**

The content mentions "WAN && LAN - revA - XSS - CVE-2017-14413, CVE-2017-14414, CVE-2017-14415, CVE-2017-14416" indicating that this CVE is related to XSS vulnerabilities found in the D-Link DIR-850L router, specifically on revision A.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within several PHP files located in `/htdocs/web` directory. Specifically, the `$_POST["action"]` parameter is directly echoed back into the XML response without any encoding.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The router's web interface fails to sanitize the `action` parameter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the vulnerable parameters. If a user interacts with the crafted URL, this JavaScript code will execute in the victim's browser. This code could be used to steal the user's authentication cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By stealing the authentication cookies, the attacker gains access to the router's management interface with the same privileges as the victim, allowing them to modify router settings, perform malicious actions on the network, etc.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker needs to make the victim visit a malicious URL on the router's web interface (e.g., sending a phishing email with a crafted link or using a compromised website to inject iframes).
*   **Specific vulnerable files**:  `/htdocs/web/wpsacts.php`, `/htdocs/web/shareport.php`, `/htdocs/web/sitesurvey.php`, `/htdocs/web/wandetect.php`, and `/htdocs/web/wpsacts.php`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user of the router's web interface to click on a malicious link. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the victim to perform the attack.

In summary, CVE-2017-14413 is a reflected XSS vulnerability found in multiple PHP files in the D-Link DIR-850L revA router. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal authentication cookies and gain control of the router's web interface, provided a user can be convinced to visit a malicious link.
