- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 web server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling OpenVPN configuration parameters via HTTP POST requests to `/goform/net_Web_get_value`. Specifically, the `remoteNetmask0` parameter is vulnerable to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The web server runs as root, which allows injected commands to execute with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the device with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject operating system commands into the `remoteNetmask0` parameter of a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/net_Web_get_value` URI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface and must be authenticated (logged in).
