The content is related to a vulnerability in the `tar-split` library used by Moby (Docker), which is described in the issue #35075.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tar-split` library, specifically in the `disassemble.go` file, reads padding sequences (null bytes) at the end of a tar archive without limiting the amount of data read, potentially leading to excessive memory usage. The library does not validate tar headers or read block by block, instead reading the full padding sequence into RAM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of tar header validation.
- Unbounded reading of padding sequences.
- Reading the padding sequence directly into memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a malicious tar archive with a large padding sequence, leading to excessive memory consumption when processed by `tar-split`. This could potentially cause a denial-of-service by exhausting system resources (RAM).

**Attack vectors:**
Crafting a malicious tar archive containing a large amount of null bytes as padding. This archive can then be pushed as an image to a Docker registry and pulled by a vulnerable Docker instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to create a crafted tar archive and push/pull it to/from a Docker registry.
