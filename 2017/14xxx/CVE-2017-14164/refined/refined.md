Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14164

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `opj_write_bytes_LE` function within the `cio.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This function is used to write bytes in little-endian format. The vulnerability occurs when writing the SOT (Start of Tile-part) marker in the `opj_j2k_write_sot` function within the `j2k.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `opj_write_bytes_LE` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This occurs during the writing of the SOT marker because `opj_j2k_write_sot` does not properly validate the output buffer size before calling `opj_write_bytes`.
- **Insufficient bounds checking:** The `opj_j2k_write_sot` function was not verifying if the provided output buffer had sufficient space to accommodate the SOT marker before calling `opj_write_bytes`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted image that triggers the heap overflow.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow could corrupt memory, leading to a crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted image files:** The vulnerability can be exploited through specifically crafted BMP, PDF, or j2k image files that trigger the vulnerable code path in OpenJPEG.
- **Processing of a malformed image:** The user or application would have to process a malicious image that would cause a heap overflow in the openjpeg library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote since the vulnerable code is triggered by processing image data, and does not require local access to the system.
- **Ability to provide crafted input:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a crafted image file to a program or system that uses the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content includes the following information that are not included in the CVE description:

- **Specific vulnerable function:**  The exact function, `opj_write_bytes_LE` in `cio.c`, and how it's called from `opj_j2k_write_sot` in `j2k.c` is identified.
- **Code execution stack trace:** The ASan output shows the call stack leading to the overflow, pinpointing the exact line numbers and functions involved, which are not included in the CVE description.
- **Reproducer:** A link to the specific PoC file that triggers the vulnerability is provided.
- **Patch Commit:** The commit that fixes the vulnerability is linked which shows the fix in the code, which is not part of the CVE description.
- **Vulnerable versions:** The affected version (2.2.0) and the versions that fix the issue.
- **Fuzzing details:** The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-14152, indicating a previous attempt to address a similar issue.
- The fix involves adding a check in `opj_j2k_write_sot` to verify the output buffer size.
