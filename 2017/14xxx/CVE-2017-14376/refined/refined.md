Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of hardcoded passwords for database accounts within EMC AppSync.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Passwords:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded passwords for administrative database accounts ("apollosuperuser" and "apollouser").

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded passwords and local access to the database can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to a compromise of the affected system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The access gained could allow the attacker to perform malicious activities within the database and, potentially, the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the AppSync database. Although remote access to the PostgreSQL database is disabled, an attacker with local access to the server could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where the AppSync database is located.
*   **Password Knowledge:** The attacker must know the hardcoded passwords for the affected accounts ("apollosuperuser" or "apollouser").

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects EMC AppSync Server versions prior to 3.5.0.1.
*   The severity is rated as CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.4 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
*   The fix is to upgrade to EMC AppSync Server version 3.5.0.1 or later.
