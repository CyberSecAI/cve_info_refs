Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `paste_tokens()` function in `asm/preproc.c` of NASM. Specifically, it involves an illegal memory access during the processing of macro tokens. The issue arises when there isn't data provided for implicit pasting in the preprocessor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Illegal memory access:**  The `paste_tokens()` function attempts to access memory using an invalid pointer which leads to a segmentation fault.
*   The while loop `while (tok && tok->next)` does not check for NULL before accessing `tok->next`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted input file can cause NASM to crash due to a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice suggests that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution but this is not explicitly shown in the available information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted source file:** A malicious attacker needs to provide a specially crafted NASM source file to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The crafted file uses macros in a way that triggers the bug in the preprocessor function `paste_tokens()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious NASM source file to the victim. This could happen through social engineering, a supply-chain attack or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   The victim needs to process the malicious file using a vulnerable version of NASM.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions that the vulnerability could lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   The provided bug report in the NASM Bugzilla shows a detailed analysis of the crash along with the stack trace and the problematic line of code. A test case was also included.
*   The issue is triggered when using the `-f bin` option.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is in commit `6f8109ebf18e3de69a8a2ad63867fe8498e49bf0`, which adds a check for null values.
