Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14859:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid memory address dereference occurs in `Exiv2::StringValueBase::read` within the `value.cpp` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory address dereference.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing crafted TIFF image metadata. Specifically when reading string values within the TIFF structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault and application crash.
- Denial of service (DoS) due to the application crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image file.
- The attacker can provide a malicious image file that, when processed by Exiv2, causes a crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image file to a user or system that utilizes the vulnerable version of the Exiv2 library.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs specifically in the `Exiv2::StringValueBase::read` function, located in the `value.cpp` file, line 302.
- The crash occurs during a memory copy operation (memcpy) triggered while creating a string.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output shows the crash occurring within `std::__cxx11::basic_string` constructor, specifically when creating a string from the input data read by `Exiv2::StringValueBase::read`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) file triggers the vulnerability when processed by `exiv2`. The PoC involves malformed TIFF metadata, which leads to an out-of-bounds read, which then causes a crash while the data is being processed to a string.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when reading metadata of an image, a common operation in image processing software.
- The fix for this issue was backported to version 0.26 and is included in the 0.27 release
- The provided Red Hat Bugzilla entry has the full call stack of the crash.
- Multiple sources confirm that a crafted image file is needed to trigger this vulnerability.
