## [Behind the Masq: Yet more DNS, and DHCP, vulnerabilities](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html "Behind the Masq: Yet more DNS, and DHCP, vulnerabilities")

October 2, 2017

Posted by Fermin J. Serna, Staff Software Engineer, Matt Linton, Senior Security Engineer and Kevin Stadmeyer, Technical Program Manager

Our team has previously posted about [DNS vulnerabilities and exploits](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html). Lately, we’ve been busy reviewing the security of another DNS software package: [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html). We are writing this to disclose the issues we found and to publicize the patches in an effort to increase their uptake.

Dnsmasq provides functionality for serving DNS, DHCP, router advertisements and network boot. This software is commonly installed in systems as varied as desktop Linux distributions (like Ubuntu), home routers, and IoT devices. Dnsmasq is widely used both on the open [internet](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=dnsmasq) and internally in private networks.

We discovered seven distinct issues (listed below) over the course of our regular internal security assessments. Once we determined the severity of these issues, we worked to investigate their impact and exploitability and then produced internal proofs of concept for each of them. We also worked with the maintainer of Dnsmasq, Simon Kelley, to produce appropriate patches and mitigate the issue.

These patches have been upstreamed and are now committed to the [project’s git repository](http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=summary). In addition to these patches we have also submitted another patch which will run Dnsmasq under [seccomp-bpf](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt) to allow for additional sandboxing. This patch has been submitted to the DNSmasq project for review and we have also made it available [here](https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/blob/master/vulnerabilities/dnsmasq/sandbox/dnsmasq-sandbox.patch) for those who wish to integrate it into an existing install (after testing, of course!). We believe the adoption of this patch will increase the security of DNSMasq installations.

We would like to thank Simon Kelley for his help in patching these bugs in the core Dnsmasq codebase. Users who have deployed the [latest version](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/) of Dnsmasq (2.78) will be protected from the attacks discovered here. Android partners have received this patch as well and it will be included in Android's monthly security update for October. Kubernetes versions 1.5.8, 1.6.11, 1.7.7, and 1.8.0 have been released with a patched DNS pod. Other affected Google services have been updated.

During our review, the team found three potential remote code executions, one information leak, and three denial of service vulnerabilities affecting the latest version at the project git server as of September 5th 2017.

It is worth expanding on some of these:

* CVE-2017-14491 is a DNS-based vulnerability that affects both directly exposed and internal network setups. Although the latest git version only allows a 2-byte overflow, this could be exploited based on previous research. Before version 2.76 and this commit the overflow is unrestricted.

==1159==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62200001dd0b at pc 0x0000005105e7 bp 0x7fff6165b9b0 sp0x7fff6165b9a8

  #6 0x41cbe9 in \_start (/test/dnsmasq/src/dnsmasq+0x41cbe9)

* CVE-2017-14493 is a trivial-to-exploit DHCP-based, stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. In combination with CVE-2017-14494 acting as an info leak, an attacker could bypass ASLR and gain remote code execution.

dnsmasq[15714]: segfault at 1337deadbeef ip **00001337deadbeef** sp 00007fff1b66fd10 error 14 in libnss\_files-2.24.so[7f7cfbacb000+a000]

* Android is affected by CVE-2017-14496 when the attacker is local or tethered directly to the device—the service itself is sandboxed so the risk is reduced. Android partners received patches on 5 September 2017 and devices with a [2017-10-01 security patch level](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-10-01) or later address this issue.

Proofs of concept are provided so you can check if you are affected by these issues, and verify any mitigations you may deploy.

We would like to thank the following people for discovering, investigating impact/exploitability and developing PoCs: Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana, Kevin Hamacher, Ron Bowes and Gynvael Coldwind of the Google Security Team.

Setup a simple network with dnsmasq as dhcpv6 server. Run any dhcpv6 client on the clients machine and obtain the network packets. Look for the server identifier inside the dhcpv6 packets. Then, run the poc on the client:# python /poc.py <ipv6 addr> <server id, hexencoded>The poc will create a response.bin file with 32k bytes worth of ram, beginning at the buffer + 38.

However, because all versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all Red Hat OpenStack Platform users should absolutely upgrade the dnsmasq RPM from Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a matter of urgency using standard update mechanisms (such as 'yum update' or 'openstack overcloud update').   ``` |  |

[Simon Kelley](/search?l=dnsmasq-discuss@lists.thekelleys.org.uk&q=from:%22Simon+Kelley%22)
[Mon, 02 Oct 2017 07:22:49 -0700](/search?l=dnsmasq-discuss@lists.thekelleys.org.uk&q=date:20171002)

```
I've just released dnsmasq-2.78, which addresses a series of serious
security vulnerabilities which have been found in dnsmasq by the Google
security team. Some of these, including the most serious, have been in
dnsmasq since prehistoric times, and have remained undetected through
multiple previous security audits.
```
```

Google's release about this can be found at:

<https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html>

Information on these bugs has been made available in advance through the
usual channels and updates to distribution packages, firmware images and
Android should be available now or very soon.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the people at Google who've
been working with me on this. Releasing information of vulnerabilities
like this in a responsible and organised manner is a fairly daunting
prospect for the uninitiated, and they've been very helpful in helping
to work through the processes. Especial thanks go to Matt Linton and
Kevin Stadmeyer.

Cheers,

Simon.

```
I've just released a new stable version of dnsmasq 2.78

Download is available at
```
```

<http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/dnsmasq-2.78.tar.gz>

This is a bugfix release, and, amongst other things, addresses a set of
serious security vulnerabilities. Update should be mandatory.

CHANGELOG is attached below.

version 2.78
        Fix logic of appending ".<layer>" to PXE basename. Thanks to
        Chris Novakovic for the patch.

        Revert ping-check of address in DHCPDISCOVER if there
        already exists a lease for the address. Under some
        circumstances, and netbooted windows installation can reply
        to pings before if has a DHCP lease and block allocation
        of the address it already used during netboot. Thanks to
        Jan Psota for spotting this.

        Fix DHCP relaying, broken in 2.76 and 2.77 by commit
        ff325644c7afae2588583f935f4ea9b9694eb52e. Thanks to
        John Fitzgibbon for the diagnosis and patch.

        Try other servers if first returns REFUSED when
        --strict-order active. Thanks to Hans Dedecker
        for the patch

        Fix regression in 2.77, ironically added as a security
        improvement, which resulted in a crash when a DNS
        query exceeded 512 bytes (or the EDNS0 packet size,
        if different.) Thanks to Christian Kujau, Arne Woerner
        Juan Manuel Fernandez and Kevin Darbyshire-Bryant for
        chasing this one down.  CVE-2017-13704 applies.

        Fix heap overflow in DNS code. This is a potentially serious
        security hole. It allows an attacker who can make DNS
        requests to dnsmasq, and who controls the contents of
        a domain, which is thereby queried, to overflow
        (by 2 bytes) a heap buffer and either crash, or
        even take control of, dnsmasq.
        CVE-2017-14491 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.
        Fix heap overflow in IPv6 router advertisement code.
        This is a potentially serious security hole, as a
        crafted RA request can overflow a buffer and crash or
        control dnsmasq. Attacker must be on the local network.
        CVE-2017-14492 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        and Kevin Hamacher of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix stack overflow in DHCPv6 code. An attacker who can send
        a DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq can overflow the stack frame and
        crash or control dnsmasq.
        CVE-2017-14493 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix information leak in DHCPv6. A crafted DHCPv6 packet can
        cause dnsmasq to forward memory from outside the packet
        buffer to a DHCPv6 server when acting as a relay.
        CVE-2017-14494 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix DoS in DNS. Invalid boundary checks in the
        add_pseudoheader function allows a memcpy call with negative
        size An attacker which can send malicious DNS queries
        to dnsmasq can trigger a DoS remotely.
        dnsmasq is vulnerable only if one of the following option is
        specified: --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet.
        CVE-2017-14496 applies.
        Credit to Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana
        Kevin Hamacher and Ron Bowes of the Google Security Team for
        finding this.

        Fix out-of-memory Dos vulnerability. An attacker which can
        send malicious DNS queries to dnsmasq can trigger memory
        allocations in the add_pseudoheader function
        The allocated memory is never freed which leads to a DoS
        through memory exhaustion. dnsmasq is vulnerable only
        if one of the following option is specified:
        --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet.
        CVE-2017-14495 applies.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

V1.3

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SCALANCE W1750D, SCALANCE M-800 / S615 and
RUGGEDCOM RM1224 devices. The highest scored vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to crash
the DNS service or execute arbitrary code. The attacker must be able to craft malicious DNS responses
and inject them into the network in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Siemens has released updates for the affected devices, recommends to update, and provides speciﬁc
countermeasures for unpatched devices.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• SCALANCE M-800 / S615 and RUGGEDCOM RM1224: Disable DNS proxy in the device conﬁgu-
ration (System - DNS - DNS Proxy - Disable Checkbox „Enable DNS Proxy“), and conﬁgure the
connected devices in the internal network to use a different DNS server

• SCALANCE W1750D: If “OpenDNS”, “Captive Portal” or “URL redirection” functionality is not used,

deploy ﬁrewall rules in the device conﬁguration to block incoming access to port 53/UDP

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE W1750D controller-based Direct Access Points support radio transmission according to
the latest IWLAN standard IEEE 802.11ac Wave 2.

The SCALANCE M-800 / S615 industrial routers are used for secure remote access to plants via mobile
networks, e.g. GPRS or UMTS with the integrated security functions of a ﬁrewall for protection against
unauthorized access and VPN to protect data transmission.

RUGGEDCOM RM1224 is a 4G ROUTER for wireless IP-communication from Ethernet based devices
via LTE(4G)- mobile radio, optimized for use in North America.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

                 CVE-2017-14495 CVE-2017-14496

Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana, Kevin Hamacher, Ron
Bowes and Gynvael Coldwind of the Google Security Team discovered
several vulnerabilities in dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and
DHCP/TFTP server, which may result in denial of service, information
leak or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.72-3+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.76-5+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.

## What cybersecurity professionals are saying

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

**Affected**

* Products

  + DSM 6.1
  + DSM 6.0
  + DSM 5.2
  + SRM 1.1
* Models

  + All Synology models

**Description**

* CVE-2017-14491

  Heap-based buffer overflow in dnsmasq before 2.78 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response.
* CVE-2017-14492

  Heap-based buffer overflow in dnsmasq before 2.78 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted IPv6 router advertisement request.
* CVE-2017-14493

  Stack-based buffer overflow in dnsmasq before 2.78 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted DHCPv6 request.
* CVE-2017-14494

  dnsmasq before 2.78, when configured as a relay, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive memory information via vectors involving handling DHCPv6 forwarded requests.
* CVE-2017-14495

  Memory leak in dnsmasq before 2.78, when the --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet option is specified, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving DNS response creation.
* CVE-2017-14496

  Integer underflow in the add\_pseudoheader function in dnsmasq before 2.78 , when the --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet option is specified, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted DNS request.
* CVE-2017-13704

  In dnsmasq before 2.78, if the DNS packet size does not match the expected size, the size parameter in a memset call gets a negative value. As it is an unsigned value, memset ends up writing up to 0xffffffff zero's (0xffffffffffffffff in 64 bit platforms), making dnsmasq crash.

**Mitigation**

For an immediate workaround, please contact us at security@synology.com.

**Update Availability**

To fix the security issue, please update DSM 6.1 to 6.1.3-15152-6 or above, DSM 6.0 to CVE-2017-13078 or above and SRM 1.1 to 1.1.5-6542-2 or above.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

These vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely via DNS and DHCP protocols and it is believed some of them are highly exploitable. The following 6 CVEs have been assigned to these vulnerabilities.  * CVE-2017-14491: DNS - 2 byte heap based overflow * CVE-2017-14492: DHCP - heap based overflow * CVE-2017-14493: DHCP - stack based overflow * CVE-2017-14494: DHCP - info leak * CVE-2017-14495: DNS - OOM DoS * CVE-2017-14496: DNS - DoS Integer underflow  We have attached a patch provided to CERT/CC by Google as an unofficial fix. You may want to wait for the official fix to be released. We expect updated dnsmasq software to be released on October 2nd, 2017 when these vulnerabilities are made public.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2836)

## Topic

An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

Security Fix(es):

* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)
* A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (CVE-2017-14492)
* A stack buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)
* An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code. An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory, potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)
* A memory exhaustion flaw was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets which would trigger memory allocations which would never be freed, leading to unbounded memory consumption and eventually a crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14495)
* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14496)

Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting these issues.

Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of several vulnerabilities affecting dnsmasq.  Three of these vulnerabilities ([CVE-2017-14491](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14491), [CVE-2017-14492](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14492), and [CVE-2017-14493](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14493)) have been rated as [Critical](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/), while the remaining four ([CVE-2017-14494](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14494), [CVE-2017-14495](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14495), [CVE-2017-14496](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14496), and [CVE-2017-13704](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13704)) have been rated as [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).  These issues were publicly disclosed on Monday, October 2nd, 2017.

## Background Information

dnsmasq is a popular lightweight DNS and DHCP server, often used in home networks and cloud environments as a caching DNS stub resolver and to manage DHCP leases.  It is provided in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it is used directly by applications including libvirt, and in a number of layered products.  Many vendors prefer dnsmasq for its low resource consumption, simple configuration and flexibility.  While it is not recommended for large-scale deployments or as an authoritative name server, it is commonly used as a local caching resolver and for small-scale LAN and cloud environments.

## Vulnerability Details

Six of these vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed under embargo by Google, and the seventh (CVE-2017-13704) was already public and fixed in the dnsmasq git repository.  Some of these affected DHCP functionality while others affected DNS, with impacts ranging from a crash, unbounded resource consumption up to potential code execution.  All seven could be triggered by malicious users on the network.

| **CVE** | **Severity** | **Introduced** | **Exposure** | **Nature of Flaw** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2017-14491 | Critical | All Versions | DNS | Heap buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14492 | Critical | 2.60 - 2.66 | IPv6 RA | Heap buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14493 | Critical | 2.60 - 2.66 | DHCPv6 | Stack buffer overflow |
| CVE-2017-14494 | Important | 2.60 - 2.66 | DHCPv6 | Information leak |
| CVE-2017-14495 | Important | 2.76 | EDNS0 | Memory exhaustion |
| CVE-2017-14496 | Important | 2.76 | EDNS0 | Segmentation fault |
| CVE-2017-13704 | Important | 2.77 | DNS | Segmentation fault |

Some of these vulnerabilities require particular options to be enabled to render dnsmasq vulnerable.  These options can appear on the command line or in a configuration file:

| **CVE** | **Configuration options that render dnsmasq vulnerable** |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2017-14492 | enable-ra slaac ra-only ra-names ra-advrouter ra-stateless |
| CVE-2017-14495 | add-mac add-cpe-id add-subnet |
| CVE-2017-14496 | add-mac add-cpe-id add-subnet |

**CVE-2017-14491: Critical**

This is the worst vulnerability, and the only one that affected all versions of dnsmasq in supported Red Hat products.  To trigger this flaw, an attacker would need to control a malicious domain (eg, *evil.com*) and send DNS requests to dnsmasq that would cause it to cache replies from that domain.  By carefully constructing DNS requests and responses, dnsmasq could be made to overflow an internal buffer on the heap, using content influenced by the attacker.  This could potentially be used to achieve code execution.

**CVE-2017-14492 and CVE-2017-14493: Critical**

These two vulnerabilities exist in IPv6/DHCPv6 functionality, and are also both buffer overflows (heap and stack, respectively).  Either could potentially be used to achieve code execution, although the use of gcc's Stack Smashing Protector (enabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7) should effectively reduce the impact of CVE-2017-14493 to only a crash.

A dnsmasq instance would only be vulnerable to these if DHCP was enabled and it was bound to an IPv6 interface.  Further, the attacker would need to be in a position to send crafted DHCPv6 or IPv6 Router Advertisement messages to the server - usually requiring administrator (root) privileges on a host on the local network.

Since DHCPv6 and IPv6 Router Advertisement support were only introduced after dnsmasq 2.60, versions earlier than this are not affected by this flaw.  We have not determined what exact release introduced the vulnerable code, other than that it was prior to dnsmasq version 2.66 (shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 and 7.3).

**CVE-2017-14494: Important**

This vulnerability also only exists in DHCPv6, and allows an attacker to cause dnsmasq to read out of bounds, revealing portions of the contents of its own memory in the DHCPv6 response packet.  While it did not seem possible to crash or gain control of dnsmasq, the information revealed could be used in conjunction with another flaw to bypass mitigations or, potentially, be sensitive in its own right.

Like the previous two vulnerabilities, this was first introduced in a version between 2.60 and 2.66 inclusive, and fixed in 2.78.  Versions prior to 2.59, as provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 5, are not affected.

**CVE-2017-14495: Important**

This vulnerability was in EDNS0 functionality (RFC-2671).  It manifested as a memory leak: when constructing EDNS0 portions of replies under certain conditions, dnsmasq would allocate an intermediate data structure and then fail to free it.  By sending a carefully selected sequence of DNS requests, an attacker could cause dnsmasq to allocate several kilobytes for each subsequent request, eventually consuming all available memory and crashing.

The affected code was introduced in dnsmasq version 2.76; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 was affected, but earlier major and minor versions were not.

**CVE-2017-14496: Important**

Also in EDNS0 code, this vulnerability is a sign-confusion flaw which would lead to memcpy() being called with a negative *size* argument.  memcpy() would interpret this as a very large positive integer and try to copy a larger region than was mapped, leading to a crash.  By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could deny service to all other processes or hosts reliant on dnsmasq as a resolver.

This flaw was also introduced in dnsmasq version 2.76; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 was affected, but earlier major and minor versions were not.

**CVE-2017-13704: Important**

Similar to CVE-2017-14496, the flaw was sign confusion, this time in the *size* argument given to memset(), and would lead to a crash.  The vulnerable memset() calls were introduced in dnsmasq 2.77 as a hardening measure, to zero buffers where response packets would be constructed, such that information leaks similar to CVE-2017-14494 would be avoided.  These calls to memset() were strictly a defensive measure as no such information leaks were previously known.  Following the discovery that these could go wrong, appropriate checks on the arguments to memset() were introduced.

This flaw was introduced in version 2.77 and fixed prior to 2.78.  No Red Hat products were affected.

## Impacted Products

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of [Critical](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

## Attack Description and Impact

Attackers with network access to an instance of dnsmasq could potentially carry out these attacks. This includes client machines or nodes on a LAN or WAN where dnsmasq is used as a caching resolver (as is optional on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host**) as well as users of virtual machines (such as those hosted by libvirt, **Red Hat OpenStack Platform** and **Red Hat OpenShift,** which use dnsmasq as part of network provisioning).

CVE-2017-14491 potentially impacts all uses of dnsmasq, while the other vulnerabilities require special conditions such as IPv6, DHCP being enabled or special options in the case of CVE-2017-11491, CVE-2017-14495, and CVE-2017-14496 (see table in the Overview tab).

Privileges of the running dnsmasq are futher restricted by SELinux policy, when SELinux is enabled, which reduces the impact of compromise and helps avoid full guest to host escapes. However, taking over dnsmasq's DNS and DHCP functionality is a significant impact even if full host compromise is not possible, as it could potentially affect other guests (virtual machines or containers) hosted in the same environment.

However, because all versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, all Red Hat OpenStack Platform users should absolutely upgrade the dnsmasq RPM from Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a matter of urgency using standard update mechanisms (such as 'yum update' or 'openstack overcloud update').   ``` |  |
