{
  "CVE-2017-14495": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak in the EDNS0 code due to improper handling of memory allocations within the add_pseudoheader function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')",
      "Lack of free()"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending malicious DNS queries to trigger memory allocations that are never freed, leading to unbounded memory consumption and eventually a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted DNS packets to a dnsmasq server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send DNS queries to the vulnerable dnsmasq server. The dnsmasq is vulnerable only if one of the following option is specified: --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet."
