The provided content details two SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the `pragyan` application.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Unfiltered user input in the `getSuggestions` function within `cms/admin.lib.php`. The `$_GET['forwhat']` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can perform boolean-based SQL injection. This could lead to data exfiltration or unauthorized modification, depending on the database schema.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Sending a crafted GET request to `pragyan/home/+admin&doaction=getsuggestions` with malicious SQL code within the `forwhat` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of the `$_GET['del_black']` parameter in the `delete_blacklist` function. While `safe_html()` is used, it is insufficient to prevent SQL injection as it only performs HTML escaping and tag removal.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Error-based SQL injection. The `id` variable is inserted into the SQL DELETE query without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can perform error-based SQL injection. This allows the attacker to extract database information, as demonstrated in the provided PoC where the database version is extracted.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to `pragyan/home/+admin&subaction=global` with malicious SQL code within the `del_black` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin.
