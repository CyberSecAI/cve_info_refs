Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the EPESI application. Specifically, it fails to prevent the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code into various input fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application is vulnerable to stored XSS in several areas, including:
    *   Task Titles
    *   Task Descriptions
    *   Task/Phone Call Notes Titles
    *   Task Alerts Titles
    *   Phone Call Subjects
    *   Phone Call Descriptions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the browser of any user who views the affected content.
*   **Data theft/manipulation:** An attacker could potentially steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, modify content on the page, or perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML code into vulnerable input fields of the application.
*   **HTTP Request Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the HTTP request when saving the task, phone call, or notes and modify the request body to include the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have an account on the affected EPESI instance and be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests when submitting data within the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit details the specific steps to inject the malicious code using an intercepting proxy.
*   The vulnerability is present in EPESI version 1.8.2 rev20170830.
*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-14712 to CVE-2017-14717.
