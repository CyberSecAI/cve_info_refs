Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14960

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of user-supplied input that is directly used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `model.jobHistoryId` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-provided input for the `model.jobHistoryId` parameter is incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database. The provided examples show how an attacker can inject SQL conditions (`and 1=1` or `and 1=2`) to verify the vulnerability.  Successful exploitation could lead to data breaches and further unauthorized access to systems and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP GET requests. The attacker manipulates the `model.jobHistoryId` parameter in the URL.
- Example vulnerable URL: `https://[victim]:4000/xDashboard/html/jobhistory/jobDocHistoryList.action?model.jobHistoryId=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement for successful exploitation based on this source.

**Affected Software:**
- EMC xPression v4.5SP1 Patch 13. It is suspected that other versions may also be vulnerable.
