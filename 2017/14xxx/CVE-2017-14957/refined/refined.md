Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14957

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in BlogoText's comment functionality. Specifically, the `markup_clean_href` function does not correctly sanitize URLs within the `[text|url]` BBCode tag. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into a comment and stored on the server. When other users (including administrators) view the comment, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `markup_clean_href` function, intended to handle BBCode links, fails to prevent JavaScript injection within the link tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- **Account Takeover (Admin):** If an administrator triggers the XSS, an attacker can gain control of the blog, leading to actions like:
    - Changing global settings.
    - Creating or deleting posts.
    - Potentially taking complete control of the application.
- **Cross-user attack:** The XSS vulnerability can be exploited against both authenticated and unauthenticated users of the blog.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Comment Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the comment functionality of BlogoText. An attacker can post a comment containing malicious JavaScript code within a specially crafted BBCode link tag.
- **BBCode Link Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the `[text|url]` BBCode tag and injects JavaScript in the URL part.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to post comments and inject malicious code.
- **Knowledge of BBCode:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `[text|url]` BBCode tag to inject the malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved sanitizing URLs in the `markup_clean_href` function.
- The vulnerability was fixed in BlogoText version 3.7.6.
- The provided diff shows a modification in `inc/conv.php` file, specifically, the `markup` and `markup_clean_href` functions.
- The vulnerability was reported on the oss-security mailing list.
