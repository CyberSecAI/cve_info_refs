The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14260.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a write access violation within the Bento4 library, specifically in the `Ap4StscAtom.cpp` file at line 95, where the code attempts to write to `m_Entries[i].m_SamplesPerChunk`. This occurs in conjunction with issues found within the `Ap4StssAtom.cpp` and `Ap4AtomSampleTable.cpp` files where incorrect data is being written to a buffer that causes the out-of-bounds write. Additionally, a memory violation was also found in `Ap4StszAtom.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Write Access Violation:** An out-of-bounds write occurs in `Ap4StscAtom.cpp` at line 95 due to incorrect indexing or bounds checking when setting the `m_SamplesPerChunk`.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The code writes beyond the allocated bounds of the `m_Entries` array in `Ap4StssAtom.cpp`
*   **Memory Violation:** In `Ap4StszAtom.cpp`, there is another memory access violation when reading sample data.
*  **Incorrect Buffer Handling**: Code in `Ap4StssAtom.cpp` reads from a buffer (`buffer`) using incorrect indexing (`i*4`) without proper bounds checking that could write out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** The write access violation could lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the written values to overwrite critical parts of the application's memory.
*   **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could potentially expose sensitive information stored in the process's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious Media File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file which contains malicious metadata.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability lies within the parsing of data within the MP4 file by the Bento4 library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **File Creation/Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious MP4 file that contains the specific malformed data structures to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Target System Interaction:** The attacker would need to get the target system to process their crafted MP4 file. This could occur through a web server that processes the file or a local application that the user might be tricked into opening.
