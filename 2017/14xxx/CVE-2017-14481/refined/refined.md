```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `send_arp()` function in `MMM::Agent::Helpers::Network.pm` on Solaris systems does not sanitize the IP address (`$ip`) before using it in a shell command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection: The vulnerability allows arbitrary shell commands to be executed due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-77)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the `mmm_agentd` process, which typically runs as root. This allows the attacker to take full control of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted MMM protocol message to `mmm_agentd`, specifically crafted role IP addresses as part of the `SET_STATUS` message.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TCP session with the `mmm_agentd` process. No authentication is required by default."
