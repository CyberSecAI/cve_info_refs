# Security Advisory 2017-10-19

## XSS, CSRF and SQL injection in phpMyFAQ

 Issued on: 2017-10-19 Software: phpMyFAQ <= 2.9.8 Risk: Medium Platforms: all

The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of some security issues that have been discovered in phpMyFAQ 2.9.8 and earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Description

phpMyFAQ does not implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS, CSRF and SQL injection. For the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities you need administrator privileges to be executed.

## Solution

The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ versions 2.9.9 which fix the vulnerabilities. All users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.

## Workaround

There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 2.9.9.

### Security Advisory: CVE-2017-14619 - PHPMyFAQ 2.9.8 - Cross-Site Scripting

###

**OVERVIEW**
**Severity Rating:** Medium
**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 2.9.8
**Confirmed Patched Versions:** 2.9.9
**Vendor:** phpMyFAQ
**Vendor URL:** http://www.phpmyfaq.de/
**Vector:** Remote
**Status:** Public
**CVE:**CVE-2017-14619
**ExploitDB URL:** https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42987/
**phpMyFAQ Security Advisory:** http://www.phpmyfaq.de/security/advisory-2017-10-19

**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**
**phpMyFAQ**is a multilingual, completely database-driven FAQ-system. It supports various databases to store all data, PHP 5.4.4+ or HHVM 3.4.2+ is needed in order to access this data. phpMyFAQ also offers a multi-language Content Management System with a WYSIWYG editor and an Image Manager, flexible multi-user support with user and group based permissions on categories and records, a wiki-like revision feature, a news system, user-tracking, 40+ supported languages, enhanced automatic content negotiation, HTML5/CSS3 based templates, PDF-support, a backup-system, a dynamic sitemap, related FAQs, tagging, RSS feeds, built-in spam protection systems, OpenLDAP and Microsoft Active Directory support, and an easy to use installation script.

phpMyFAQ is developed and maintained by [Thorsten Rinne](http://rinne.info/)

**SUMMARY AND IMPACT**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpMyFAQ through 2.9.8 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the "Title of your FAQ" field in the Configuration Module.

In phpMYFAQ Administrator has the privilege to edit the Configuration of the phpMyFAQ Portal, wherein he can also change the title of the Portal.  The “Title of your FAQ” field does not properly filter and sanitize the user input which thus, results into a Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability.
Whenever any user visits this portal, the admin’s (attacker’s) malicious JavaScript will be executed by the title on the user’s browser.
###

**PROOF OF CONCEPT**
###

**WORKAROUNDS**
There is no workaround except for updating to the latest version of phpMyFAQ from [here](http://www.phpmyfaq.de/download)

**Advisory Update:** November 13, 2017

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
