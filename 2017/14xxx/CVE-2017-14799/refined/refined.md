Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-14799:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** Micro Focus Access Manager 4.3, specifically the Access Gateway Embedded Service Provider (ESP).

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization within the ESP login URL parameters. Specifically, the ESP login URL parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing malicious input.

**Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation on the ESP login URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code.

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload containing JavaScript or other client-side script within the ESP login URL parameters.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and get the victim to access it. It is not clear if this requires a MITM attack or if the attacker can simply trick the victim into clicking a link.

**Impact of Exploitation:** When a user accesses the crafted URL, the malicious script is reflected back into the response message, where it is executed within the user's browser. This can lead to:
   - **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal the user's session cookies, granting them unauthorized access to the application.
   - **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
   - **Data Theft:**  The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information.
   - **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content displayed to the user.

**Resolution:** The vulnerability was addressed by implementing input sanitization and validation of the ESP login URL in Access Manager 4.3.3.
