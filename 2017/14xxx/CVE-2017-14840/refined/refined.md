```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not validate the file name before saving it, allowing an attacker to upload files with arbitrary extensions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file upload. The application uses `getClientOriginalName()` to save the file, which can be manipulated by an attacker to upload malicious files with arbitrary extensions (e.g., PHP).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the profile settings page by uploading a file with a crafted name.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application and have access to the profile settings page."
