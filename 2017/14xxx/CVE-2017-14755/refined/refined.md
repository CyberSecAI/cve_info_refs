Title: OpenText Document Sciences xPression (formerly EMC Document Sciences xPression) - Cross-Site Scripting
Author: Marcin Woloszyn
Date: 27. September 2017
CVE: CVE-2017-14755

Affected Software:
OpenText Document Sciences xPression (formerly EMC Document Sciences xPression)

Exploit was tested on:
v4.5SP1 Patch 13 (older versions might be affected as well)

Cross-Site Scripting:
It is possible to inject Javascript into the application which will be reflected to unaware application users. This might allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of unaware application users.
In order to remediate the issue, proper input validation, sanitizing and output encoding should be conducted on server side.

No CSRF token is necessary for exploitation.

Vector :
https://[...]/xAdmin/html/XPressoDoc?categoryId=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>&_dc=1&start=0&limit=10

```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation, sanitizing, and output encoding on the server side.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will be reflected to other users. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the unsuspecting users.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `categoryId` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload and trick a user into accessing the URL. The user would need to be logged into the application. No CSRF token is required.
