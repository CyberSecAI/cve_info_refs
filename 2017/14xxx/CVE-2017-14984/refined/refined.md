- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `bp_name` parameter from the GET request, before displaying it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious script within the `bp_name` parameter in the GET request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit it. No specific user level privileges are mentioned and assumed that no special privileges are needed to exploit.
