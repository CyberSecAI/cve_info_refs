Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function within the `image.cpp` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Exploiting this vulnerability results in a program crash due to a segmentation fault.
