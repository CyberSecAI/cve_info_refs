  "CVE-2017-14064": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the JSON extension of ruby. An attacker with the ability to pass a specially crafted JSON input to the extension could use this flaw to expose the interpreter's heap memory.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in using strdup in ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop after encountering a '\\0' byte, returning a pointer to a string of length zero, which is not the length stored in space_len.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Heap exposure",
      "Incorrect string handling"
     ],
    "impact": "Exposure of the interpreter's heap memory. Can potentially lead to information disclosure",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted JSON input",
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to pass a specially crafted JSON input to the extension.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the 'opts' argument to `JSON.generate` contains a '\\0' character. The object being serialized cannot directly cause the memory disclosure, so user influence on the opts argument is key."
