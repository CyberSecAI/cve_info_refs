| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-01 09:08:12 UTC  ``` Ruby through 2.2.7, 2.3.x through 2.3.4, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 can expose arbitrary memory during a JSON.generate call. The issues lies in using strdup in ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop after encountering a '\0' byte, returning a pointer to a string of length zero, which is not the length stored in space_len.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/flori/json/commit/8f782fd8e181d9cfe9387ded43a5ca9692266b85>  References:  <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13853> <https://hackerone.com/reports/209949>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-01 09:08:30 UTC  ``` Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1487553](show_bug.cgi?id=1487553 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-14064 ruby: Arbitrary heap exposure during a JSON.generate call [fedora-all]")]   Created ruby193-ruby tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openshift-1 [[bug 1487554](show_bug.cgi?id=1487554)]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c2)  Doran Moppert    2017-09-06 04:26:39 UTC  ``` This is triggered by passing a string containing \0 in the "opts" argument to JSON.generate - the object being serialised cannot cause memory disclosure to occur.  Normally, this argument can not be influenced by users or potential attackers.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-15 09:21:20 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/09/14/json-heap-exposure-cve-2017-14064/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-19 08:37:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS  Via RHSA-2017:3485 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3485](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3485)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2017-12-19 17:06:53 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and 6. These versions do not include the JSON module.  This issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as well as the versions of rh-ruby22-ruby and rh-ruby23-ruby as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections.

Debian Bug     : 851161

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the interpreter for the Ruby
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:

CVE-2015-9096

    SMTP command injection in Net::SMTP via CRLF sequences in a RCPT TO
    or MAIL FROM command.

CVE-2016-2339

    Exploitable heap overflow in Fiddle::Function.new.

CVE-2016-7798

    Incorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in the
    OpenSSL extension.

CVE-2017-0898

    Buffer underrun vulnerability in Kernel.sprintf.

CVE-2017-0899

    ANSI escape sequence vulnerability in RubyGems.

CVE-2017-0900

    DoS vulnerability in the RubyGems query command.

CVE-2017-0901

    gem installer allowed a malicious gem to overwrite arbitrary files.

CVE-2017-0902

    RubyGems DNS request hijacking vulnerability.

CVE-2017-0903

    Max Justicz reported that RubyGems is prone to an unsafe object
    deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which
    processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification
    can lead to remote code execution.

CVE-2017-10784

    Yusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability in
    the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the WEBrick log and
    potentially execute control characters on the victim's terminal
    emulator when reading logs.

CVE-2017-14033

    asac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    extension. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to
    cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2017-14064

    Heap memory disclosure in the JSON library.

CVE-2017-17405

    A command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP might allow a
    malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary commands.

CVE-2017-17742

    Aaron Patterson reported that WEBrick bundled with Ruby was vulnerable
    to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. It was possible for an
    attacker to inject fake HTTP responses if a script accepted an
    external input and output it without modifications.

CVE-2017-17790

    A command injection vulnerability in lib/resolv.rb's lazy_initialze
    might allow a command injection attack. However untrusted input to
    this function is rather unlikely.

CVE-2018-6914

    ooooooo_q discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the
    Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library. It made it possible for
    attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a .. (dot dot)
    in the prefix argument.

CVE-2018-8777

    Eric Wong reported an out-of-memory DoS vulnerability related to a
    large request in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.

CVE-2018-8778

    aerodudrizzt found a buffer under-read vulnerability in the Ruby
    String#unpack method. If a big number was passed with the specifier @,
    the number was treated as a negative value, and an out-of-buffer read
    occurred. Attackers could read data on heaps if an script accepts an
    external input as the argument of String#unpack.

CVE-2018-8779

    ooooooo_q reported that the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open
    methods of the socket library bundled with Ruby did not check for NUL
    bytes in the path argument. The lack of check made the methods
    vulnerable to unintentional socket creation and unintentional socket
    access.

CVE-2018-8780

    ooooooo_q discovered an unintentional directory traversal in
    some methods in Dir, by the lack of checking for NUL bytes in their
    parameter.

CVE-2018-1000075

    A negative size vulnerability in ruby gem package tar header that could
    cause an infinite loop.

CVE-2018-1000076

    RubyGems package improperly verifies cryptographic signatures. A mis-signed
    gem could be installed if the tarball contains multiple gem signatures.

CVE-2018-1000077

    An improper input validation vulnerability in RubyGems specification
    homepage attribute could allow malicious gem to set an invalid homepage
    URL.

CVE-2018-1000078

    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage
    attribute.

CVE-2018-1000079

    Path Traversal vulnerability during gem installation.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0378)

## Topic

An update for ruby is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It has features to process text files and to perform system management tasks.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the Net::FTP module did not properly process filenames in combination with certain operations. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands by setting up a malicious FTP server and tricking a user or Ruby application into downloading files with specially crafted names using the Net::FTP module. (CVE-2017-17405)
* A buffer underflow was found in ruby's sprintf function. An attacker, with ability to control its format string parameter, could send a specially crafted string that would disclose heap memory or crash the interpreter. (CVE-2017-0898)
* It was found that rubygems did not sanitize gem names during installation of a given gem. A specially crafted gem could use this flaw to install files outside of the regular directory. (CVE-2017-0901)
* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not sanitize DNS responses when requesting the hostname of the rubygems server for a domain, via a \_rubygems.\_tcp DNS SRV query. An attacker with the ability to manipulate DNS responses could direct the gem command towards a different domain. (CVE-2017-0902)
* A vulnerability was found where the rubygems module was vulnerable to an unsafe YAML deserialization when inspecting a gem. Applications inspecting gem files without installing them can be tricked to execute arbitrary code in the context of the ruby interpreter. (CVE-2017-0903)
* It was found that WEBrick did not sanitize all its log messages. If logs were printed in a terminal, an attacker could interact with the terminal via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-10784)
* It was found that the decode method of the OpenSSL::ASN1 module was vulnerable to buffer underrun. An attacker could pass a specially crafted string to the application in order to crash the ruby interpreter, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2017-14033)
* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not properly sanitize gems' specification text. A specially crafted gem could interact with the terminal via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-0899)
* It was found that rubygems could use an excessive amount of CPU while parsing a sufficiently long gem summary. A specially crafted gem from a gem repository could freeze gem commands attempting to parse its summary. (CVE-2017-0900)
* A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the JSON extension of ruby. An attacker with the ability to pass a specially crafted JSON input to the extension could use this flaw to expose the interpreter's heap memory. (CVE-2017-14064)
* The "lazy\_initialize" function in lib/resolv.rb did not properly process certain filenames. A remote attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to inject and execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2017-17790)

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Topic

An update for rh-ruby24-ruby is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It has features to process text files and to perform system management tasks.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-ruby24-ruby (2.4.2). (BZ#1506785)

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer underflow was found in ruby's sprintf function. An attacker, with ability to control its format string parameter, could send a specially crafted string that would disclose heap memory or crash the interpreter. (CVE-2017-0898)
* It was found that rubygems did not sanitize gem names during installation of a given gem. A specially crafted gem could use this flaw to install files outside of the regular directory. (CVE-2017-0901)
* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not sanitize DNS responses when requesting the hostname of the rubygems server for a domain, via a \_rubygems.\_tcp DNS SRV query. An attacker with the ability to manipulate DNS responses could direct the gem command towards a different domain. (CVE-2017-0902)
* A vulnerability was found where the rubygems module was vulnerable to an unsafe YAML deserialization when inspecting a gem. Applications inspecting gem files without installing them can be tricked to execute arbitrary code in the context of the ruby interpreter. (CVE-2017-0903)
* It was found that WEBrick did not sanitize all its log messages. If logs were printed in a terminal, an attacker could interact with the terminal via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-10784)
* A vulnerability was found where rubygems did not properly sanitize gems' specification text. A specially crafted gem could interact with the terminal via the use of escape sequences. (CVE-2017-0899)
* It was found that rubygems could use an excessive amount of CPU while parsing a sufficiently long gem summary. A specially crafted gem from a gem repository could freeze gem commands attempting to parse its summary. (CVE-2017-0900)
* A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the JSON extension of ruby. An attacker with the ability to pass a specially crafted JSON input to the extension could use this flaw to expose the interpreter's heap memory. (CVE-2017-14064)
