Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-14501:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read flaw exists in the `parse_file_info` function within `archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c` in libarchive when extracting a specially crafted iso9660 ISO file. This is related to the function `archive_read_format_iso9660_read_header`.
- The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect handling of directory record lengths in ISO9660 images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data beyond the boundaries of allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS). An attacker can craft a malicious ISO image that, when processed by libarchive, triggers an out-of-bounds read, potentially crashing the application.
- There is also mention of a potential to get access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ISO9660 archive file to an application using the vulnerable version of libarchive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious archive file to a system using a vulnerable version of libarchive. This can happen if the application attempts to parse an archive file from an untrusted source.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered by a crafted ISO file that causes a heap-buffer-overflow when processed by `bsdtar`.
- The `parse_file_info` function is specifically mentioned as the location of the out-of-bounds read.
- The vulnerability is present in `libarchive` versions prior to 3.3.3.
- The vulnerability affects multiple distributions, including Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS, and Debian Jessie and Stretch.
- The fix involves validating the directory record length in ISO9660 processing.
- Patches and fixes were released to address the vulnerability.
