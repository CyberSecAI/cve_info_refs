{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper authentication allows an attacker to bypass authentication by accessing a specific URL if they have the same IP address as an authenticated user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can spoof the IP address of an authenticated user, assume the authenticated user's identity, and gain privileges or access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack. The attacker needs to have the same IP address as a valid user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the same IP address as an authenticated user on the network. Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability."
