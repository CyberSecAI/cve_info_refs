Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-14107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a memory allocation failure in the `_zip_cdir_grow` function within the `libzip` library. This function is responsible for growing the central directory structure when a ZIP archive is being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Allocation Failure:** The core issue is that when processing a crafted ZIP archive, the `_zip_cdir_grow` function attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory (827476025344 bytes in the provided ASan output). This allocation failure leads to a crash, causing a denial-of-service. The vulnerability occurs when the library mishandles the end-of-central-directory (EOCD) records within the zip archive, leading to the allocation of an excessive amount of memory.
*   **Inconsistent EOCD checks:** The commit message for the fix indicates inconsistent checks between ZIP and ZIP64 cases, which could lead to issues when parsing archives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash in the application using the libzip library. This prevents the application from functioning correctly and thus results in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ZIP Archive:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted ZIP archive. An attacker can create a malicious ZIP file with a manipulated EOCD record that triggers the excessive memory allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious ZIP archive to an application or service that is using the vulnerable version of `libzip` library. This could be achieved through various means, including uploading the crafted zip file or providing the malicious zip via network to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** `libzip` versions prior to 1.3.0 are vulnerable. The provided blog post identifies 1.2.0 as an affected version.
*   **Fixed Version:** The issue is resolved in `libzip` version 1.3.0
*   **Reproducer:** A proof-of-concept file can be found at: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00330-libzip-memallocfailure-_zip_cdir_grow`
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop fuzzer.
*   **Patch:** The fix is in the commit: `https://github.com/nih-at/libzip/commit/9b46957ec98d85a572e9ef98301247f39338a3b5`

**In summary:** This CVE describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in `libzip` caused by a memory allocation failure when processing specially crafted ZIP files. The vulnerability is triggered when the `_zip_cdir_grow` function attempts to allocate an excessive amount of memory due to mishandled EOCD records.
