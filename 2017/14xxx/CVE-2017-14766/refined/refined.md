Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication checks within the `fn_ssr_add_st_submit()` and `fn_ssr_del_st_submit()` functions in the `functions.php` file of the Simple Student Result WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The plugin fails to verify if the user making the request is authorized to modify student records.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses student ID numbers (`rid`) from the request to identify which record to modify, allowing attackers to modify arbitrary records.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There are no checks in place to validate data such as the CGPA, potentially allowing injection of arbitrary data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Unauthenticated attackers can update or delete student records. This includes modifying sensitive data such as student names, CGPA, subjects, and other details.
- **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete student records, resulting in data loss.
- **Potential for Fraud:** Modification of grades and results can lead to fraud.
- **Reputational Damage:** Compromised student data can damage the reputation of the institution using the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates parameters in the POST request, particularly the `rid` (record ID) parameter, to target specific student records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Student IDs:** The attacker needs to know the student ID (`rid`) they wish to target.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress site hosting the vulnerable plugin.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to update a student's CGPA by sending a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.6.4 of the Simple Student Result plugin.
- The vendor was contacted and released a patch.
