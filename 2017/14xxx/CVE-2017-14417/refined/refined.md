Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-14417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication checks on the `/register_send.php` webpage of the D-Link 850L revB router. This allows an attacker to use this page to register the device with a MyDlink cloud account they control. Critically, the router sends the admin password in cleartext to the Dlink cloud platform during this registration process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/register_send.php` page does not require authentication, making it accessible to anyone on the network.
2.  **Cleartext Password Transmission:** The admin password is sent in cleartext to the MyDlink cloud servers during the device registration process.
3.  **Cleartext Password Storage:** The router stores the admin password in cleartext, allowing `/register_send.php` to retrieve it.
4.  **Password Leakage in Cloud API Responses:** The MyDlink cloud APIs (specifically the `PUT` and `GET` requests to retrieve device information) leak the device's admin password in cleartext.
5.  **Lack of Certificate Verification:** The MyDlink protocol uses self-signed certificates without proper verification, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on the encrypted portion of the traffic.
6.  **Cleartext traffic:** The tunnel created between the device and the cloud server does not properly encrypt all traffic

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Router Control:** An attacker can gain complete control over the router, including the ability to change settings, access connected devices, and update the firmware.
*   **Data Exposure:** The cleartext transmission and storage of the admin password exposes it to the attacker.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and modify traffic to and from the router due to the weak cloud protocol and the lack of certificate verification.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** The compromised router can be used as a base to attack other devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The attacker can register the device with their own cloud account through the unauthenticated `/register_send.php` page reachable over the network (LAN or WAN if exposed).
*   **Passive information gathering:** By monitoring HTTP traffic from the Dlink's NPAPI plugin, an attacker can passively obtain device credentials in cleartext from the MyDlink Cloud.
*   **MITM attacks:** By forging a valid certificate, an attacker can intercept and modify traffic between the router and the cloud platform due to the lack of certificate verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the D-Link 850L revB router, either from the local network (LAN) or remotely (WAN) if exposed.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **MyDlink Account:** The attacker needs to create a free MyDlink account.
*   **Browser with NPAPI Support:** To exploit the password leakage via MyDlink cloud APIs, the attacker needs a browser (e.g., Firefox 50) that supports NPAPI plugins, which are used to manage the router via the cloud interface.
