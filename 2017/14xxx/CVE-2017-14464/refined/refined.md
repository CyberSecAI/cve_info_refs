The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14464.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper access control in the Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLC firmware. Specifically, multiple files within the PLC allow read and/or write access to unauthenticated users via the CIP protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Access Control: The PLC does not properly restrict access to sensitive files, allowing unauthenticated users to read and write data.
- Unauthenticated Access: Exploitation requires no authentication, making the PLC vulnerable to anyone on the network.
- CIP Encapsulated PCCC Commands: The vulnerability is exploited using CIP encapsulated PCCC commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Triggering Device Faults: Modification of specific files can lead to fault states.
- Causing NVRAM/Memory Module Mismatch: Specifically, setting the NVRAM/memory module user program mismatch bit (S2:9) when a memory module is NOT installed triggers fault code 0001.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: Attackers can send specially crafted network packets via CIP encapsulated PCCC commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the PLC.
- No Authentication Required: No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of CIP protocol: The attacker needs to craft specific packets using CIP encapsulated PCCC commands.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B FRN 21.2 and earlier versions.
- The document provides a Python proof-of-concept (PoC) script that demonstrates various exploitation scenarios, including triggering an NVRAM/memory module mismatch and related fault.
- The specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-14464) is one of several vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-14462 to CVE-2017-14473) affecting the same product due to improper access control.
- The vulnerability requires the keyswitch state to be in "REMOTE" or "PROG".
