Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14610:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Bareos daemons (bareos-dir, bareos-fd, and bareos-sd) create their PID files *after* dropping privileges to a non-root user (typically "bareos"). This allows a compromised "bareos" user to modify the PID file, potentially causing issues with init scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PID File Manipulation:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the PID file is writable by a non-root user after the daemon drops privileges.
*   **Trust of PID Files:** Init scripts and other tools may blindly trust the contents of the PID file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Signal Hijacking:** A malicious user who compromises the "bareos" user can replace the PID in the file with the PID of a root process (e.g. PID 1). Subsequent attempts to signal the Bareos daemon using the PID file will then signal the targeted root process, potentially causing a system reboot or other severe issues.
*   **Denial of Service:** The most direct impact is the potential to cause a denial of service by killing the wrong process.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  Compromise of the "bareos" user account.
2.  Modification of the PID file by the compromised "bareos" user.
3.  Triggering an action (e.g., restart, stop) that relies on the PID file, typically done through init scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have compromised the "bareos" user account on the system.
*   The attacker needs to have write access to the PID file location.
*   The attacker needs a way to trigger an action that relies on the PID file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue affects bareos-dir, bareos-fd, and bareos-sd.
*   The vulnerability is most significant in scenarios where init scripts are used to manage the daemons, and those scripts rely on the integrity of the PID files.
*   Systemd-based systems are less vulnerable because systemd manages process states and doesn't rely on PID files, but the vulnerability exists for non-systemd systems.
*   The original vulnerability assessment for the CVE was considered too high (7.8), and a revised assessment of 4.2 (moderate) was proposed by Bareos developers. This was because the vulnerability requires user interaction (restart/stop) to be exploited. The confidentiality and integrity impacts were also disputed as the attack would more directly impact availability.
*   The fix implemented in Bareos 21.0.0 allows the pid file to be created before dropping privileges by specifying the -p command line option, or not created by default.
*   The issue was resolved by no longer creating PID files by default unless specifically requested and, if requested, they are created before dropping privileges.

The content provides a good level of detail for understanding the vulnerability and its fix, and it matches the description given for CVE-2017-14610 which states the issue is related to "PID files created after dropping privileges".
