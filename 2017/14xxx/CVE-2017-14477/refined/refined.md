The provided content is a vulnerability report for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-14477.

**CVE-2017-14477**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `MMM::Agent::Helpers::Network::add_ip()` function on FreeBSD systems within the Multi-Master Replication Manager for MySQL (MMM) `mmm_agentd` daemon. This function constructs a shell command by concatenating the path to the `ifconfig` binary with the interface and IP address from user-controlled input. Because it uses backticks to execute the constructed command and does not sanitize the IP address, it allows for command injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The `add_ip()` function uses backticks to execute a shell command constructed with unsanitized user-provided input (the IP address). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The IP address parameter is not sanitized before being incorporated into a shell command.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the `mmm_agentd` process, which typically runs as root. This allows for complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker can send a specially crafted `SET_STATUS` protocol message to `mmm_agentd`, including a malicious IP address as part of the role definition.
    *   The attacker must be able to initiate a TCP session with the `mmm_agentd` daemon.
    *   The vulnerable code is triggered when new roles are configured, and IP addresses are added using `configure_ip` helper command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. By default, mmm_agentd does not require authentication.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerability occurs in this code block within the `MMM::Agent::Helpers::Network.pm` file:

```perl
# lib/Agent/Helpers/Network.pm
84                  $output = `/sbin/ifconfig $if inet $ip netmask 255.255.255.255 alias`;

```

This code is used on FreeBSD systems. The `$ip` variable is taken from the attacker and used in a backtick shell command.
