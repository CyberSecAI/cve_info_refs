    "Description": "JasPer 1.900.8, 1.900.9, 1.900.10, 1.900.11, 1.900.12, 1.900.13, 1.900.14, 1.900.15, 1.900.16, 1.900.17, 1.900.18, 1.900.19, 1.900.20, 1.900.21, 1.900.22, 1.900.23, 1.900.24, 1.900.25, 1.900.26, 1.900.27, 1.900.28, 1.900.29, 1.900.30, 1.900.31, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, 2.0.4, 2.0.5, 2.0.6, 2.0.7, 2.0.8, 2.0.9, 2.0.10, 2.0.11, 2.0.12, 2.0.13, 2.0.14, 2.0.15, 2.0.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted image, related to the jas_image_ishomosamp function in libjasper/base/jas_image.c.",
    "Root cause": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `jas_image_ishomosamp` function within `libjasper/base/jas_image.c`. The vulnerability is triggered due to an incorrect calculation of component dimensions leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
        "Improper validation of component data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash), and may have other unspecified impact",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service by providing a crafted image file that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted image file to the vulnerable application."
