# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Several issues were found and corrected in Poppler, a PDF rendering library,
that could lead to denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact when
processing maliciously crafted documents.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.48.0-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

For the detailed security status of poppler please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/poppler>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

This vulnerability has been reproduced in both the latest stable release 0.59.0 and the latest code in the repository. xpdf also affected.  A pdf file has been attached to help to reproduce this vulnerability. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=102607#c1)  Albert Astals Cid    2017-09-08 16:30:31 UTC  ``` Fixed, thanks :) ``` |  |
