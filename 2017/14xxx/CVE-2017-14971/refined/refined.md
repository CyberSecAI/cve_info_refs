Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-14971:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Infocus Mondopad is vulnerable to a hashed credential disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The Mondopad allows an authenticated user to upload a malicious file.
- An unauthenticated user can potentially break out of Kiosk Mode and manually upload a malicious file.
- The system does not properly sanitize or block SMB requests initiated by opening and clicking on a UNC path hyperlink embedded within the uploaded file (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet).

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can capture the NetNTLMv2 hash by making the Mondopad initiate an SMB request to a rogue server by clicking on a malicious UNC link.
- Captured NetNTLMv2 hashes can be potentially relayed to other systems on the network if configured with the same credentials and without SMB Signing enabled. This could lead to unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious file containing a UNC path (hyperlink). This can be done by an authenticated user or an unauthenticated user that bypasses Kiosk Mode.
- The user needs to open the uploaded malicious file and click the embedded UNC link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to either be an authenticated user on the Mondopad or be able to bypass Kiosk Mode to upload a malicious file.
- The attacker needs to set up a rogue server to capture the SMB requests and the NetNTLMv2 hash.
- An understanding of SMB, UNC paths, and NTLMv2 authentication is required.
