# SAMBAry save us!!

Posted by[Alfie](https://the-infosec.com/author/babachieth/)[May 26, 2017September 14, 2017](https://the-infosec.com/2017/05/26/samba-cve-2017-7494/)Posted in[OS Security](https://the-infosec.com/category/os-security/)Tags:[445](https://the-infosec.com/tag/445/), [CVE-2017-7494](https://the-infosec.com/tag/cve-2017-7494/), [Exploit](https://the-infosec.com/tag/exploit/), [Metasploit](https://the-infosec.com/tag/metasploit/), [Samba](https://the-infosec.com/tag/samba/), [Shodan](https://the-infosec.com/tag/shodan/)

Remember linux users laughing at Windows users because of the now all too famous Wannacry? Karma.

According to [Samba](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-7494.html), “All versions of Samba from 3.5.0 onwards are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it.” Might appear not to be serious,but a quick look at our beloved Shodan we see roughly **half** **a million** companies with publicly exposed samba (shares.) – not to say all are exploitable but narrowing down and just by viewing the versions, more than half are!!!

![shodan_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shodan_.png?w=750)

**Exploitation:**

Various exploits have been released, I explored the exploit by HD Moore and it works pretty well; At the time of writing it had not been ported to metasploit, port it manually as below, fire up msf.

![exploit msf_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/exploit-msf_.png?w=750)

![msf exploit_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/msf-exploit_.png?w=750)

We would all appreciate a Check module in the msf exploit, since it is not there, I decided to do a manual grep – tedious if you a have a large estate to check but better safe than sorry.

**How to check:**

Download either of [these files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6ZFkPc775b9UU5iUEQyMG9leFU), which show open ports 139 and 445 for public IPs globally as at May 24th and search for your IP of interest :-)..am sure programmers have an easier way?

![grep_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/grep_.png?w=750)

**Remediation:**

As usual PATCH! Samba have already released a [patch](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html) for versions 4.4 onwards. There are workarounds for the other versions, though they could break functionality – the workaround is to add the parameter “nt pipe support = no” to the smb.conf global section and restart smbd service.

*On a light note 😀*

   I tried to download “these files” and Not Found, how do you put the “files” back? Your website is very good.

      You could download the latest ports scans over at <https://scans.io/> and specify which scans you are interested in…

Posted by[Alfie](https://the-infosec.com/author/babachieth/)[May 12, 2017September 4, 2018](https://the-infosec.com/2017/05/12/from-shodan-to-rce-opendreambox-2-0-0-code-execution/)Posted in[Application Security](https://the-infosec.com/category/application-security/), [OS Security](https://the-infosec.com/category/os-security/)Tags:[Command](https://the-infosec.com/tag/command/), [Dreambox](https://the-infosec.com/tag/dreambox/), [Exploit](https://the-infosec.com/tag/exploit/), [remote code execution](https://the-infosec.com/tag/remote-code-execution/), [Shodan](https://the-infosec.com/tag/shodan/)

A sequel to the last [post](https://the-infosec.com/2017/06/22/hacking-jenkins/) of what is now becoming a series of “From Shodan to remote code execution”, we now take a look at how to hack misconfigured Dreambox installations. Dreambox is a company which offers Digital TV set top boxes and other related services.

*Shodan search:*

Perform a shodan search as below:

![shodan search_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shodan-search_.png?w=750)

Go through the portals in the search results. The indicator of a vulnerable dreambox installation is the presence of webadmin plugin as below:

![webadmin-plugin_.png](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/webadmin-plugin_-e1499264379175.png?w=750)

From the address bar run linux commands using the syntax: [http://IP/PORT/webadmin/script?command=](http://212.13.x.129:8081/webadmin/script?command=)|”linux\_command” as shown below:

![id _](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/id-_.png?w=750)

![etc passwd_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/etc-passwd_.png?w=750)

![etc shadow_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/etc-shadow_.png?w=750)

![whoami_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/whoami_.png?w=750)

![cat issue_](https://the-infosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cat-issue_.png?w=750)

Credits:  [Jonatas Fil,](https://github.com/ninj4c0d3r) the discoverer of the vulnerability.
