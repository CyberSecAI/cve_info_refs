Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14723:

**Verification:**

The content from `wordpress.org`, `debian.org`, and the provided commits on `github.com` and `core.trac.wordpress.org` clearly indicate that CVE-2017-14723 is related to a security vulnerability within the `wpdb::prepare()` function in WordPress. This function is used to prepare SQL queries and sanitize inputs. The vulnerability arises from how the function handles placeholders and additional arguments.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `wpdb::prepare()` function in WordPress prior to version 4.8.2 did not properly handle cases where an array of values was passed for placeholders, and extra values beyond the number of placeholders were also provided. This could lead to unexpected SQL queries if plugins or themes used the function incorrectly, potentially leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the inadequate validation and handling of arguments provided to the `wpdb::prepare()` function, which results in an incorrect construction of SQL queries. The function allowed for additional, unused arguments when an array was provided, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function did not properly escape unescaped percent signs, and it is important to escape or remove these in order to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability could be significant as it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This could potentially lead to:
*   Data breaches - unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database
*   Data manipulation - modification or deletion of stored data
*   Complete compromise of the application if the SQL injection is severe enough.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is primarily through plugins or themes that use the vulnerable `wpdb::prepare()` function incorrectly by passing it an array of values and then additional arguments, where these values are derived from user-controlled input. A plugin or theme might use this function to create dynamic queries. If the function is used in a way that the developer did not anticipate, an attacker could manipulate the data provided to this function, possibly via GET or POST parameters or other user-controllable inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need:

1.  A vulnerable WordPress installation running a version prior to 4.8.2
2.  A plugin or theme that is using the `wpdb::prepare()` function in a way that leads to the vulnerability
3.  The ability to control input used by the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content also details the fixes made to address this vulnerability:

*   The `wpdb::prepare()` function now ignores additional values if an array is passed as the main argument for placeholders.
*   The function now properly escapes unescaped percent signs.
*   Changes were made to ensure the function behaves as documented.
*   Unit tests were added to cover various scenarios and prevent regressions.

The fix for this vulnerability is included in WordPress 4.8.2, and the Debian Security Advisory also mentions patched versions for Debian distributions.
