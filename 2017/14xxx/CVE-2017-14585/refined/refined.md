Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14585

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF:** The application allows an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the 'admin' interface of HipChat Server and Data Center products.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The SSRF vulnerability can lead to remote code execution if an attacker is able to manipulate server-side requests to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the "admin" interface.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating requests made by the application on the server side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that the vulnerable functionality is only accessible to administrators of the HipChat Server or Data Center instance.

**Affected Versions:**
- Hipchat Server versions starting with 2.2.0 and before 2.2.6
- Hipchat Data Center versions starting with 3.0.0 and before 3.1.0

**Fix Versions:**
- HipChat Server version 2.2.6
- HipChat Data Center version 3.1.0

**Summary:**
The provided content describes a critical security vulnerability in HipChat Server and Data Center products where an authenticated administrator can exploit an SSRF vulnerability in the 'admin' interface to achieve remote code execution. This issue is marked as a highest priority bug and has been fixed in the specified versions.
