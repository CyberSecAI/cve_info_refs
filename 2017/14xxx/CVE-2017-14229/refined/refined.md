Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an infinite loop in the `jpc_dec_tileinit` function within the `jpc_dec.c` file of the JasPer library. Specifically, the loop at line 893 (`for (cblkcnt = prc->numcblks, cblk = prc->cblks; cblkcnt > 0;)`) does not decrement `cblkcnt` in some cases leading to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is a missing decrement of the `cblkcnt` variable within the loop in `jpc_dec_tileinit`. This missing decrement causes the loop to never terminate, resulting in an infinite loop.
*   **Loop Condition:** The loop's condition `cblkcnt > 0` relies on `cblkcnt` being decremented, which does not happen under certain conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop causes the program to hang indefinitely, consuming CPU resources and rendering the application unresponsive. This results in a denial-of-service condition, as the application cannot process other tasks or requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted JPEG2000 image file (POC10).
*   **File Processing:** The attack vector involves processing a malicious input file using the vulnerable JasPer library (specifically through `imginfo` utility). The `imginfo` utility then calls the vulnerable function `jpc_dec_tileinit` via `jpc_dec_decode`, `jpc_decode` and `jas_image_decode`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG2000 input file to the vulnerable application using the Jasper library.
*   **Access to System:** The attacker needs access to a system where the vulnerable JasPer library is used. This could be a local system or a remote system if the application is used as a service.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content gives a detailed analysis of the infinite loop location along with stack trace (backtrace from `gdb`), code snippets, and the specific vulnerable function
*   The content mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by team OWL337 using their custom fuzzer.

This issue is referenced by the Gentoo Security Advisory [GLSA 201908-03], which also advises that JasPer is no longer maintained upstream and should be unmerged due to numerous unaddressed vulnerabilities.
