```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `AP4_BitStream::ReadBytes` function due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the read buffer, leading to a very large allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow",
    "Integer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted AAC file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious AAC file to the vulnerable application (bento4 tool `aac2mp4`)."
