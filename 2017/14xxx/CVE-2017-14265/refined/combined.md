## Description

[![@Twi1ight](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7844543?v=4&size=48)](/Twi1ight)[Twi1ight](https://github.com/Twi1ight)opened [on Sep 8, 2017](https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw/issues/99#issue-256187001)

A Stack Buffer Overflow was discovered in `internal/dcraw_common.cpp:5685`(LibRaw::xtrans\_interpolate). It could allow remote denial of service

and code execution attack.

command to reproduce: `./simple_dcraw crash-xtrans_interpolate-stack-overflow`

the latest version is vulnerable. other versions may also be affected.

the sanitizer output:

```

```

in `internal/dcraw_common.cpp:5688 (xtrans_interpolate)`, color was defined as:

```
  int val, ndir, pass, hm[8], avg[4], color[3][8];

```

with the input testcase in gdb, we could see that the `h` is 3, which leads stack overflow

```
(gdb) f 2
#2  0x0000000000650838 in LibRaw::xtrans_interpolate (this=0x7ffffff72c60, passes=3) at internal/dcraw_common.cpp:5836
5836	                color[h][d] = g + rix[i << c][h] + rix[-i << c][h];
(gdb) p h
$24 = 3
(gdb) p d
$25 = 0
