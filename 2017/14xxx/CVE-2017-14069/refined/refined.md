The provided content includes a description of a vulnerability in NexusPHP 1.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the `nowarn.php` file. Specifically, the `$_POST[usernw]` array is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying or deleting database records.
- **Server Backdoor:** If the database user has root permissions, the attacker could use SQL injection to write a backdoor file to the server.
- **Denial of Service:**  The provided exploit demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, which can be used to create a denial of service by making the server unresponsive while the sleep command executes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `nowarn.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **`UC_MODERATOR` Privilege:**  In a default installation, the attacker would require `UC_MODERATOR` privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Database Root Access:**  To write a backdoor to the server the attacker needs the database access to be running as a root user.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:**  The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the server.
