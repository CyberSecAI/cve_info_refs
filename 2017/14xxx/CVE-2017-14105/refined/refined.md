The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Backup Archive Handler of Aerohive HiveManager Classic. A local user, even with restricted tenant privileges, could upload a manipulated backup archive containing a jsp webshell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure handling of backup archives.
- Lack of proper sanitization or validation of the backup archive content before restoration.
- Writable file paths allowing for JSP shell uploads outside of the intended tenant scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the underlying system.
- Full compromise of the web UI.
- Access to other Tenant files and configurations.
- Potential for complete system compromise.
- Code execution as the tomcat user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the HiveManager Classic system.
- Uploading a specially crafted backup archive through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the Aerohive HiveManager Classic system (even a user with restricted "Tenant" privileges).
- Ability to create a modified .tar.gz backup archive containing a malicious webshell.
