I appreciate the fix, and the refactor. LGTM

[@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) how do you want to handle the implicit API change? (no explicit breakage, but existing clients may rely on unauthenticated bind implicitly triggered by no password)

I think this is just a matter of a new version tag?

| I think this is just a matter of a new version tag?  Definitely a new version tag. I'd like it to be a major version, but there were [other breaking changes](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av3) I wanted to see in the 3.0 bump that I don't have bandwidth to do in the next few days. I'm ok merging this into master, starting a v2 maintenance branch just prior to this, and holding tagging a 3.0 release until the other cleanup tasks are done |

During the code reshuffle in #126 at bind time a call to encodeControls
was added. Unfortunately, the safety check around calling it when there
are no controls to encode were omitted from this call (unlike in del.go
and search.go). As a result the packet was always getting control
characters added even if there were none to encode.
