Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `register_send.php` page on the D-Link DIR-850L (revB) router not properly checking user authentication. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and register the device to a malicious MyDlink Cloud account. The page also retrieves and sends the device's administrator password in cleartext to D-Link's remote APIs during the device registration. Additionally, the MyDlink Cloud service exposes the device's password in cleartext via its API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The `/register_send.php` page allows unauthenticated access.
2.  **Cleartext Password Transmission:** The device's administrator password is sent in cleartext to the MyDlink cloud service during the registration process.
3.  **Cleartext Password Storage and Exposure:** The MyDlink cloud service exposes the device's password in cleartext via its API responses. This is demonstrated through HTTP PUT and GET requests to the service.
4.  **Insecure Cloud Protocol:** The custom MyDlink Cloud protocol relies on a simple TCP relay without proper encryption by default, allowing an attacker to sniff the traffic between the router and the cloud service.
5.  **Lack of SSL Certificate Verification:** The device uses a self-signed certificate without validation which can be easily MITMed

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Router Control:** An attacker can gain complete control over the router remotely by:
    *   Registering the device to a malicious MyDlink account.
    *   Retrieving the admin password in cleartext.
    *   Using the leaked password to log in to the router’s web interface.
*   **Remote Firmware Modification:** Once full control is achieved, an attacker can modify the router's firmware.
*  **Data theft and manipulation**: By acting as a MITM the attacker can monitor and modify the traffic between the router and the cloud platform which includes user credentials and configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Web Page Access:** The attacker accesses the `/register_send.php` page without any authentication.
*   **MyDlink Cloud API Abuse:** The attacker exploits the MyDlink cloud API by registering the router under their account, and intercepts the password when it is transmitted by this API.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** By exploiting the lack of encryption and certificate verification, the attacker can intercept traffic between the router and the cloud platform, gaining access to configuration data and user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to Router:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (LAN or WAN).
*   **MyDlink Account Creation:** The attacker needs to create a MyDlink cloud account.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web and Networking Protocols:** The attacker must be able to use a web browser, and analyze network traffic using tools such as the browser’s developer tools.
*   **MITM capabilities**: The attacker should be able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack when the device is connected to MyDlink cloud services, to intercept traffic and passwords.
