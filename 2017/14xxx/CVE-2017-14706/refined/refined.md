{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues: an information disclosure vulnerability that allows retrieval of a security token (iToken) and a command injection vulnerability in a logging function that uses this token for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure: An unauthenticated endpoint leaks a security token (iToken).",
      "Command Injection: A logging functionality in `/webservices/stream/tail.php` is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized user-controlled input (`uid` parameter) passed to the `shell_run()` function after authentication.",
        "Insufficient input validation of the 'typeOf' parameter allows bypassing the authentication mechanism in the `/webservices/download/index.php` endpoint.",
         "Insecure use of shell_run(): The `shell_run()` function executes shell commands based on user input without proper sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker first exploits the information disclosure vulnerability to obtain a valid `iToken` by sending a GET request to `/webservices/download/index.php` with `typeOf=debug` and `applianceUid=LOCALUID`.",
      "Next, the attacker crafts a malicious GET request to `/webservices/stream/tail.php`, including the obtained `iToken` and a malicious `uid` parameter designed to inject commands into the shell via the `shell_run` function. The crafted command is executed on the server."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DenyAll Web Application Firewall instance and the ability to send HTTP requests to it. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
