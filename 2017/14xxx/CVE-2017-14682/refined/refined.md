Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow within the `GetNextToken()` function in `MagickCore/token.c`. This is triggered while processing a malformed SVG image. The `GetNextToken()` function is responsible for parsing tokens from input strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A specially crafted SVG image causes `GetNextToken()` to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The overflow could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running ImageMagick. This is a possibility, though not explicitly confirmed in the provided text. The text only mentions a "possible" code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG Image:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG image file containing specific data that triggers the heap overflow during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SVG image to a user or system that is processing it with ImageMagick. This could be via a website upload, email attachment, etc.
*   No specific user interaction is explicitly mentioned, meaning an automated system using ImageMagick for processing would also be vulnerable if it processes the crafted SVG.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified through fuzz testing.
*   The issue is triggered in the context of SVG image processing, specifically when parsing tokens inside a malformed SVG file.
*   The provided stack trace pinpoints the overflow occurring within the `GetNextToken()` function, called during the parsing process.
*   The affected versions include those prior to the patches released in the provided Debian and Ubuntu security advisories.
*   The provided content includes specific affected package versions for Debian (8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u3, 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u11) and Ubuntu (various versions, see the "Update Instructions" section in the Ubuntu notice).

The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, giving specific function names (`GetNextToken()`) and the type of file (`SVG`) that triggers the issue, as well as the exact location in the code where the buffer overflow occurs.
