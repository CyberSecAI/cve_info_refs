The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14348.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `LibRaw::processCanonCameraInfo` function due to insufficient bounds checking when processing Canon camera maker note data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically a write of size 1 is performed out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability leads to a crash due to AddressSanitizer detecting a heap-buffer-overflow, indicating a potential for denial-of-service.
*   It is possible that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with further analysis of the overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Processing a specially crafted Canon RAW image file (CR2).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a maliciously crafted CR2 file to the vulnerable application (LibRaw).
