  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-14176",
    "description": "Bazaar through 2.7.0, when Subprocess SSH is used, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a bzr+ssh URL with an initial dash character in the hostname, a related issue to CVE-2017-9800, CVE-2017-12836, CVE-2017-12976, CVE-2017-16228, CVE-2017-1000116, and CVE-2017-1000117.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Bazaar (bzr) Subprocess SSH vendor"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because a hostname starting with a dash ('-') in a 'bzr+ssh://' URL is passed verbatim to the ssh command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SSH options.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command injection via crafted URL",
	  "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running bzr, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. A specially crafted 'bzr+ssh://' URL is provided to the victim.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick the victim into using a specially crafted 'bzr+ssh://' URL.",
    "additional_information": "This is similar to the vulnerability found in Git and Mercurial related to how they handle SSH URLs. The vulnerability is present when the Subprocess SSH vendor is used, and not with the Paramiko SSH Vendor. The fix involves ensuring that host arguments to ssh are not treated as ssh options by adding a '--' before the hostname for openssh, and printing an error for other implementations such as plink (putty)."
