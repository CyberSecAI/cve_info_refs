Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14651:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the WSO2 Data Analytics Server's management console. Specifically, the `collectionName`, `parentPath` and `path` parameters within the `/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp` and `/carbon/resources/permissions_ajaxprocessor.jsp` endpoints are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages served by the WSO2 server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
    -  Redirection of the user's browser to a malicious website.
    -  Modification of the UI of the web page.
    -  Retrieval of sensitive information from the user's browser (e.g., session cookies).
    -  Hijacking a logged-in user's session, allowing attackers to change passwords and gain unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the following:
   -  **POST Request (Issue 1):** An attacker can send a crafted POST request to `/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp` with malicious XSS payloads in the `collectionName` and `parentPath` parameters.
   -   **GET Request (Issue 2):** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with XSS payloads in the `path` parameter of `/carbon/resources/permissions_ajaxprocessor.jsp`, and trick the victim into accessing it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WSO2 Data Analytics Server.
    -  For the POST request attack, the attacker needs to know how to structure the request to include the vulnerable parameters.
    -  For both attacks, the victim needs to be logged into the WSO2 Management Console.
    -  The attacker may need to trick the victim into clicking a link containing the malicious payload for the GET request based attack.

**Additional Details:**
-  The vulnerability affects multiple WSO2 products, not just Data Analytics Server, as listed in the provided content.
-  The vulnerability was discovered on July 8, 2017 and reported to WSO2 on July 21, 2017.
-  Patches were made available by WSO2.
-  The vulnerability has been fixed in the affected WSO2 products.
