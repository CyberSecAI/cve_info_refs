#### Date

##### July 21, 2017

### Description

Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified on WSO2 Data Analytics Server Products 3.1.0 in the management console. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script and can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser, or harm.

**\*Affected Products:** API Manager 2.1.0 App Manager 1.2.0 Application Server 5.3.0 Business Process Server 3.6.0 Business Rules Server 2.2.0 Complex Event Processor 4.2.0 Dashboard Server 2.0.0 Data Analytics Server 3.1.0 Data Services Server 3.5.1 Enterprise Integrator 6.1.1 Enterprise Mobility Manager 2.2.0 Governance Registry 5.4.0 Identity Server 5.3.0 IoT Server 3.0.0 Machine Learner 1.2.0 Message Broker 3.2.0 Storage Server 1.5.0

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

Issue 1: Accessing the POST Request of the URL, [https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/add\_collection\_ajaxprocessor.jsp](https://wso2ip:9443/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp) with XSS payloads through vulnerable variable **collectionName** and **parentPath** will execute XSS in the victimâs browser.

***Figure 04:* *Reflected response for the vulnerable variable parentPath with XSS Payload is executed.***

Issue 2: Accessing the GET Request of the URL, [https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/permissions\_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%2F\_system%2Ftest%2Fhack-xss’)”>](https://wso2ip:9443/carbon/resources/permissions_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%252F_system%252Ftest%252Fhack-xss')%2522%253E)<script>alert(3)</script>&random=1275 will execute XSS in victimâs browser.

# Details:

WSO2 Product Bug Report

Bug Name: Multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Product Name: WSO2

Server: WSO2 Data Analytics Server Product.

Version: 3.1.0

Last Updated: 09-09-2015

Homepage: <https://wso2.com/analytics>

Severity: Medium

Status: Fixed

Exploitation Requires Authentication?: yes

Vulnerable URL: <https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp>

Vulnerable Variable: **collectionName & parentPath**

# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 Data Analytics Server Product. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

**Issue 1:**

Accessing the POST Request of the URL, <https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp> with XSS payloads through vulnerable variable **collectionName** and **parentPath** will execute XSS in victim’s browser.

[![xss_01_request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537901-383256ee-9c89-11e7-96ed-588bc8a56033.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537901-383256ee-9c89-11e7-96ed-588bc8a56033.png)

**Figure 1:** POST request URL, <https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp> with XSS payloads through vulnerable variable **collectionName**

**Figure 2:**Reflected response for the vulnerable variable **collectionName** with XSS Payload is executed.

**Figure 3:** POST request URL, <https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/add_collection_ajaxprocessor.jsp> with XSS payloads through vulnerable variable **parentPath** (also collection name has to be injected with any invalid symbols)

**Figure 4:** Reflected response for the vulnerable variable **parentPath** with XSS Payload is executed.

**Issue 2:**

Accessing the GET Request of the URL [https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/permissions\_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%2F\_system%2Ftest%2Fhack-xss')">](https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/permissions_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%2F_system%2Ftest%2Fhack-xss')%22%3E)<script>alert(3)</script>&random=1275 will execute XSS in victim’s browser.

[![xss_03_request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537899-382b66c2-9c89-11e7-976d-d290a6183670.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537899-382b66c2-9c89-11e7-976d-d290a6183670.png)

**Figure 5:** GET request URL, [https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/permissions\_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%2F\_system%2Ftest%2Fhack-xss')">](https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/resources/permissions_ajaxprocessor.jsp?path=%2F_system%2Ftest%2Fhack-xss')%22%3E)<script>alert(3)</script>&random=1275 with XSS payload through path variable is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.

[![xss_03_response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537900-382e72ea-9c89-11e7-956e-13d33450f3f8.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/30537900-382e72ea-9c89-11e7-956e-13d33450f3f8.png)

**Figure 6:** Accessing GET request is executing XSS payload through the vulnerable variable.

---

**Reproducing Steps**

1. Logon into carbon application with given credentials (admin/admin in localhost)
2. Now, access the vulnerable GET & POST Request URL with payload inserted into the vulnerable variable.
3. XSS will get executed in the user machine once the user clicks on the given vulnerable link with XSS Payloads for both GET & POST request.
