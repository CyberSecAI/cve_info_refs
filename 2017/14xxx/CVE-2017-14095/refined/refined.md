Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `/widget/inc/widget_package_manager.php` script of Trend Micro Smart Protection Server. This script takes user-provided input (`update_type` parameter) and passes it to the PHP `require_once` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The lack of sanitization in the `update_type` parameter allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files via the `require_once` function. Although the application appends "PoolManager.php" to the end of the filename, attackers can bypass it by controlling the filename to be included via the `update_type` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code residing on the server. This can lead to remote command execution in the context of the web server user (webserv).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/widget/inc/widget_package_manager.php` by controlling the `update_type` parameter within the JSON request body.
*   **Malicious File Placement:** Before triggering the LFI, the attacker needs to place a malicious file on the server, which can be achieved by abusing the update process. This involves setting up a fake update server and tricking the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server into downloading a malicious file through the update functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server.
*   **Ability to Host a Fake Update Server:** The attacker needs to set up a fake update server that serves a malicious update package to exploit the LFI.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `widget_package_manager.php` script uses the `update_type` parameter from a POST request to dynamically load a PHP file.
*   The `WidgetPoolFactory` class constructs the filename for `require_once` by concatenating the `update_type` parameter with `PoolManager.php` .
*   An attacker can bypass this by including a previously uploaded file with a name of `rshell` and the application would then try to `require_once /var/tmcss/activeupdate/rshellPoolManager.php`
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject a reverse shell via a malicious php file placed in the `/var/tmcss/activeupdate` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit requires combining the LFI vulnerability with the ability to upload files via the update mechanism.
* Privilege escalation exploits exist to go from the `webserv` user to root.
* The content provides a very detailed explanation of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept exploit.
