Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-14166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `atol8` function within `archive_read_support_format_xar.c` in libarchive.
*   The function doesn't handle empty strings properly, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** When `atol8` receives an empty string (zero length) as input, it attempts to read beyond the allocated memory. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where `char_cnt` is 0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-based buffer over-read can lead to an application crash, resulting in a denial of service. This is because the memory read can access unmapped memory regions or corrupt the heap.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted XAR Archive:** A remote attacker can create a specially crafted XAR archive file that contains malformed or empty string entries to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable code is used to process the crafted archive file, for instance using `bsdtar`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be triggered by processing a malicious file.
*   **Ability to Provide Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver the crafted XAR file to be processed by the vulnerable libarchive version.
*   **User Interaction (CVSS Vector):** The CVSS vector indicates user interaction is required (`UI:R`), meaning an end-user or system process needs to open the malicious file for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was discovered using fuzzing techniques (American Fuzzy Lop).
* The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to handle zero-length strings in `atol8`.
*   The issue is related to mishandling empty strings in the `atol8` function.

**Affected Software:**

*   libarchive versions prior to 3.3.3 are affected.

**Patch Information:**

* The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `fa7438a0ff4033e4741c807394a9af6207940d71`.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 (Moderate).
