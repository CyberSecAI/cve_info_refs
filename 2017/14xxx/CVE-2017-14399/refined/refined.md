Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `\backend\media\ajax\_rename.php` file of BlackCat CMS 1.2.2.
*   The file does not properly validate the file suffix (extension) during the renaming process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system fails to check or sanitize the file extension provided by the user during file renaming.
*   **Arbitrary File Extension Change:** This lack of validation allows a user to change a file's extension to an executable script type (e.g., .php).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By renaming an uploaded file to a `.php` extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Getshell:** As demonstrated in the provided example, the attacker can obtain a shell on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attacker first uploads a permitted file type such as a `.jpg`.
*   **File Rename:** The attacker then uses the file renaming functionality, specifically targeting the `\backend\media\ajax\_rename.php` endpoint.
*   **Extension Manipulation:** When renaming, the attacker uses the extension parameter to change the file extension to `.php`, essentially transforming the uploaded file into a malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user of the BlackCat CMS.
*   **File Upload Access:** The attacker requires the ability to upload files through the CMS interface.
*   **File Rename Access:** The attacker requires access to the file renaming functionality.
