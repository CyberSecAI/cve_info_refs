The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14852.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application transmits sensitive information, including credentials, in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing encryption of sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to transmitted data can obtain credentials and bypass authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access, and other impacts. The CVSS score indicates high impact in terms of confidentiality, low impact on integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based, via interception of the unencrypted transmissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic where the vulnerable application is transmitting sensitive data. This could be an attacker on the same network or an attacker capable of man-in-the-middle attacks.
