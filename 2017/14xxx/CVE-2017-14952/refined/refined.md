Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14952:

**Verification:**

1.  The Oracle advisory explicitly lists CVE-2017-14952 as a vulnerability impacting "Oracle Utilities Framework" due to "icu4j".
2.  The sourcebrella.com content describes a double-free vulnerability in the ICU library. The advisory says that this vulnerability is in the ICU library (icu4j is the java version of it). This is consistent with the vulnerability described in the Oracle document which states that the vulnerability affects the "Oracle Utilities Framework" and is due to "icu4j".

**Summary:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a double-free condition in the `ZoneMeta::createMetazoneMappings` function within the ICU library's `zonemeta.cpp` file. The issue occurs when memory allocation fails, leading to a double free.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Double-Free:** The code attempts to free the same memory region twice. Once via `deleteOlsonToMetaMappingEntry` and once via `uprv_free`.
    *   **Memory Allocation Failure Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered when memory allocation fails (i.e., when `uprv_malloc()` returns a null pointer).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the double free, causing the system to crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Large Data Processing:** Applications processing large datasets may trigger memory allocation failures.
    *   **Embedded Systems:** Resource-constrained embedded systems utilizing ICU are vulnerable.
    *   **Custom Memory Allocation:** Custom memory allocation functions provided through `u_setMemoryFunctions()` that can return NULL pointers may trigger this issue.
    *   **Network Exploitation (as per Oracle):** The Oracle document indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable over a network using the HTTP protocol, although the specific mechanism is not detailed in the Sourcebrella content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable code path, either through influencing data processed by the vulnerable library or causing resource exhaustion.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is said to have existed for over 10 years and was present in all ICU versions up to and including 59.1.

**Summary of Oracle Advisory**

*   The Oracle advisory confirms that this is a remotely exploitable vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 when exploiting "Oracle Utilities Framework".
*   The advisory also lists the impacted versions of the "Oracle Utilities Framework".
*   Oracle advises to apply the security patches as soon as possible.
*   It mentions that this affects other components through an included shared library.

**Additional notes:**
The sourcebrella content describes a double-free vulnerability in the ICU library in general. The Oracle advisory connects this to the vulnerability in their "Oracle Utilities Framework" product because it includes the vulnerable ICU library.

This vulnerability was fixed in the trunk of the ICU library.

**CVE Relevance:**

The information directly relates to CVE-2017-14952, providing details on the root cause, affected components, impact, and attack vectors.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause:** Double-free vulnerability in ICU's `ZoneMeta::createMetazoneMappings`.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Double-free, inadequate error handling of memory allocation failures.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), system crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Large data processing, embedded systems, custom memory allocation functions, and network exploitation via HTTP (as per Oracle).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to trigger memory allocation failures, and network exploitation (as per Oracle).
