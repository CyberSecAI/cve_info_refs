Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14420:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2017-14420 under the section "WAN - revA and revB - Weak Cloud protocol". This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the weak implementation of the MyDlink Cloud protocol used by D-Link routers. The protocol lacks proper encryption by default, acting as a basic TCP relay system. This exposes the traffic between the router and the cloud server to potential eavesdropping and manipulation. Furthermore, the lack of certificate verification allows for Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Communication:** The MyDlink Cloud protocol transmits data over TCP to Amazon servers without encryption. This means all traffic (including credentials) is sent in the clear.
*   **Lack of Certificate Verification:** When HTTPS is used, the router provides a self-signed certificate. The client (NPAPI plugin) does not verify this certificate, enabling MITM attacks through forged certificates.
*   **MAC Address Usage:** The `/mydlink/signalc` program uses the router's MAC address to generate a unique identifier. This identifier remains constant even after device resets or re-linking to a new cloud account which allows D-Link to 'follow' the ownership of the device.
*   **Credential Exposure:** Credentials for third party accounts (gmail, hotmail) are transferred to the router through the insecure tunnel created by the MyDlink Cloud Protocol.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Eavesdropping:** Attackers can intercept and read the unencrypted traffic sent through the MyDlink Cloud protocol. This can expose sensitive information, including passwords and other configuration data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** By forging a self-signed SSL certificate, an attacker can intercept and modify the traffic between the router and the cloud server. This could lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized control over the router.
*  **Credential Theft:** By intercepting the cleartext traffic, an attacker can steal user credentials for cloud services and third-party mail accounts, which are transfered unencrypted through the MyDlink Cloud protocol.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the D-Link router and the Amazon cloud server can passively sniff the TCP traffic.
*   **MITM Attack:** An attacker positioned to intercept the traffic and who can create forged self-signed certificates can manipulate the traffic.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between the router and the cloud infrastructure to intercept the communication or to perform a MITM attack.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  A basic knowledge of network sniffing and MITM techniques is needed.
*  **D-Link router using MyDlink Cloud Service**: The target router must be using the vulnerable MyDlink Cloud service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is present in both revision A and B of the D-Link 850L router.
*   The document also describes other vulnerabilities in the D-Link 850L routers. These are not related to CVE-2017-14420 and include: XSS, Backdoor access, Stunnel private keys, DNS configuration, weak file permissions, pre-auth RCE and DoS attacks.
