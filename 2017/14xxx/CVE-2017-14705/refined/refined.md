The provided content describes a vulnerability in DenyAll Web Application Firewall, which is different from the specified CVE-2017-14705. The content describes CVE-2017-14706

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of two weaknesses: an information leak and a command injection vulnerability.
*   A debug endpoint in the `/webservices/download/index.php` allows unauthenticated users to retrieve a `debug.dat` file that contains a critical `iToken` value. This `iToken` is used for authentication in other parts of the application.
*   A command injection vulnerability exists in `/webservices/stream/tail.php`, where the `uid` parameter, controllable by the attacker, is used in a `shell_run()` function call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The debug endpoint exposes sensitive authentication tokens without proper access control.
*   **Command Injection:**  Unsanitized user-controlled input (`uid` parameter) is passed to a shell command.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The `typeOf` parameter being set to "debug" bypasses authentication checks in the download endpoint
*   **Publicly accessible service:** The XML API port is not bound to localhost as expected, making it accessible remotely

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the affected system with the privileges of the web server user (`daactrl`).
*   The attacker can gain a meterpreter session or a command shell, allowing them to perform further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   The attacker first retrieves the `iToken` via the debug endpoint (`/webservices/download/index.php?applianceUid=LOCALUID&typeOf=debug`).
*   The attacker then injects a command into the `uid` parameter of the `/webservices/stream/tail.php` endpoint, utilizing the leaked `iToken` for authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DenyAll Web Application Firewall instance.
*   No prior authentication is required. The attacker exploits unauthenticated endpoints to leak the token and inject a command.
