Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14749

**Vulnerable Software:** JerryScript 1.0

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of unrecognized backslash escape sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\r`) within JavaScript strings during bytecode generation. Specifically, when a backslash followed by an unrecognized character is encountered, it results in a NULL byte (0x00) being inserted into the bytecode's literal data. This NULL byte acts as a compressed pointer, which corrupts the heap memory when the bytecode is executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Memory Corruption:** The incorrect NULL byte in the bytecode leads to a corrupted compressed pointer. During bytecode execution, references to literals add an offset which overwrites the `jerry_global_heap.next_offset` pointer, corrupting the free chunk list.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write (OOB):** The heap corruption allows for potential out-of-bounds writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash due to heap memory corruption, leading to a denial of service.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap memory corruption can lead to the faking of free chunk lists. This could be exploited to achieve a local write primitive and potentially remote code execution if JerryScript is embedded in a host application that executes JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript file containing backslash escape sequences that result in NULL bytes in the generated bytecode.
*   **Local:** The attack vector is local meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute the malicious Javascript code on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide malicious Javascript:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted JavaScript file to the vulnerable JerryScript instance.
*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS score indicates user interaction is required (UI:R), suggesting some form of user action is needed to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The issue is located in the bytecode generation part of JerryScript
*   The vulnerability is triggered when backslashes are included in strings, which when processed, generate NULL words (0x00) in the bytecode.literal data. These NULL words are then used as compressed pointers leading to heap corruption during execution

**Additional Information**

*  The provided github issue includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) in Javascript showing the vulnerable syntax.
*  The exploit is triggered during bytecode generation and when concatenating strings which have had incorrect backslash escape sequences.
