## Description

JerryScript 1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (jmem\_heap\_alloc\_block\_internal heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .js file, because unrecognized \ characters cause incorrect 0x00 characters in bytecode.literal data.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### PoC and Crash in release 1.0.0

Assigned as [CVE-2017-14749](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28qj-36f6-4995 "CVE-2017-14749"), Credit by ADLab of Venustech

PoC.js is as follows(hex displayed):

```
00000000: 275c 0a27 2b27 3035 3627 3b0a            '\.'+'056';.

```

Among the first string, there is a '\n'(0x0a). This byte could be replaced by '\r'(0x0d) or other bytes as with a '\' at front. And this kind of bytes makes the generated byte code contains an NULL word(0x00), which lead to a crash as the following stack trace shows:

```

#### Root cause

When processing the strings, the generated byte code are as follows:

```
b vm.c:669
668    uint8_t *byte_code_p = frame_ctx_p->byte_code_p;
669    jmem_cpointer_t *literal_start_p = frame_ctx_p->literal_start_p;
crash:
08289b54     [00 00 29 00] 86 00 01 08 46 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff
08289b64     60 fe 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

normal:
08289b6c     [32 00 29 00] 86 00 01 08 46 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff

08289b8c     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
08289b9c     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

```

The NULL word in 0x00290000 is one of the bytecode.literal compressed pointer. When bytecode is executed, the reference of the literal add 0x10 while jerry\_global\_heap.next\_offset was overwritten because of the compressed pointer. Twice as it was referenced so the field was added up to 0x20. This makes the index of the free chunk lists corrupts.

#### Potential Risks

With the heap memory corruption the free chunk lists could be faked. Potentially there exists an local write primitive in memory. If jerry is embedded in some host and could execute js, this vulnerability could result in remote code execution.

#### Fix Suggestion

Check code in bytecode generation: the failed literal's compressed pointer should not be NULL word.

#### PoC and Crash in release 1.0.0

Assigned as [CVE-2017-14749](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28qj-36f6-4995 "CVE-2017-14749"), Credit by ADLab of Venustech

PoC.js is as follows(hex displayed):

```
00000000: 275c 0a27 2b27 3035 3627 3b0a            '\.'+'056';.

```

Among the first string, there is a '\n'(0x0a). This byte could be replaced by '\r'(0x0d) or other bytes as with a '\' at front. And this kind of bytes makes the generated byte code contains an NULL word(0x00), which lead to a crash as the following stack trace shows:

```

#### Root cause

When processing the strings, the generated byte code are as follows:

```
b vm.c:669
668    uint8_t *byte_code_p = frame_ctx_p->byte_code_p;
669    jmem_cpointer_t *literal_start_p = frame_ctx_p->literal_start_p;
crash:

08289b9c     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

```

The NULL word in 0x00290000 is one of the bytecode.literal compressed pointer. When bytecode is executed, the reference of the literal add 0x10 while jerry\_global\_heap.next\_offset was overwritten because of the compressed pointer. Twice as it was referenced so the field was added up to 0x20. This makes the index of the free chunk lists corrupts.

#### Potential Risks

With the heap memory corruption the free chunk lists could be faked. Potentially there exists an local write primitive in memory. If jerry is embedded in some host and could execute js, this vulnerability could result in remote code execution.

#### Fix Suggestion

Check code in bytecode generation: the failed literal's compressed pointer should not be NULL word.
