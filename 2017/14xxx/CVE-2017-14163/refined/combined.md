### Bug Description

This are some security issues around Mahara and session cookies.

When one logs into Mahara a 'mahara' cookie is set in the browser containing a unique string for the session. This value is also saved in the usr\_session table to keep track of the session.

When one closes the browser without logging out the value in the usr\_session table is not removed so if someone were to open a browser and visit the Mahara site and adjust the 'mahara' cookie to the old value they can get access to the user's account.

Things that need fixing:

1) when a user logs in it clears any obsolete usr\_session cookies for the user.

- this will decrease the chance an old cookie value can be used to access the user's account.

2) recording the user-agent of the session and if it changes to prompt the user to login again

- this should reduce the chance of someone capturing the cookie value on the network and using it

3) when self adding / editing email address(es) that they are required to give their current password

- this should reduce the hacker's ability to take over an account they get into (similar to how we do this currently when changing our password).

NOTE: Using an https site will greatly reduce the ability to discover the cookie value as the cookie will be sent securely.

Got an email about this issue.

The scenario that is described here is a perfectly valid use of session. We can never know that user terminated the browser, so the only thing we can do is to look for old sessions and purge old one after some lengthy inactivity. There is already a session timeout mechanism in place. Reusing own cookie in different browser is definitely not a security issue.

"This should reduce the chance of someone capturing the cookie value on the network and using it" is not right... Once you get access to someone's cookies it is pretty much game over.

We have a session timeout code and we are setting proper security flags on our cookie - that is far far more important!

Email change with password? This doesn't make it more secure. Sending confirmation to previous and already verified email is the best way to confirm it is you. However, I do realise that email is not a required field in Mahara. Also, how would this password confirmation work with SSO?

Re: the user agent, I am not sure if that is a good idea either. According <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Binding_the_Session_ID_to_Other_User_Properties> it is a good thing to capture, but does nothing against skilled hackers. If we need to add a user agent, it can be added to $\_SESSION itself, no need to modify database structure.

Optional IP locking might be a good thing to add. It is rarely used this days, but can be useful when necessary.

Thank you for your concerns, Yuliya. We'll discuss this a bit more and post a suggestion for review here to see what can be done.

Having discussed this some more we will proceed with points 1) and 2) from initial description

but for point 3) we will do this instead:

3) On adding a new email via the Content -> Profile section we will send 2 emails

- one to the new email address asking user to confirm address

- and one to the primary email address to alert user that a new email is being added to their account and if this is bad how to contact their admin about the problem.
