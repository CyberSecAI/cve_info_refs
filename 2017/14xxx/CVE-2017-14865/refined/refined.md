Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14865:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow located in the `Exiv2::us2Data` function within the `types.cpp` file at line 346 of the exiv2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `Exiv2::us2Data` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow can overwrite critical data, potentially leading to a crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Application crash:** The provided ASAN output shows that the program crashes when the heap-buffer-overflow is triggered.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF image file to an application using the vulnerable exiv2 library.
- The attacker does not need access to the system, as the vulnerability can be triggered by simply processing the malicious image file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing of the exiv2 library.
- The issue was assigned the CVE-2017-14865 ID.
- The vulnerability was fixed in exiv2 version 0.27.0-1.el7_6.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) file is attached to the bug report, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `Exiv2::us2Data` function when handling TIFF images.
