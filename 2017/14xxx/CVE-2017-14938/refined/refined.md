{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing sanity check on the `sh_info` field of an SHT_GNU_verneed section, which is used to determine the number of version dependency entries to allocate memory for. An attacker can craft an ELF file with an extremely large value for `sh_info`, causing the program to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of the `sh_info` field of a SHT_GNU_verneed section when reading symbol version tables.",
       "Unbounded memory allocation based on attacker controlled data."
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted ELF file can cause the `nm` utility to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service. In the reported case, it consumed 230GB of RAM and likely triggered an out-of-memory condition.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious crafted ELF file with a large sh_info value to the `nm` utility. This can be achieved by making the victim analyze this crafted binary.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create/modify an ELF file and convince a victim to use the `nm` utility (or potentially other affected binutils tools) to process it."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "fix": "The fix adds a sanity check to ensure that the size of memory allocated based on sh_info is reasonable. The fix also removed the unnecessary zeroing of the allocated memory.",
         "affected_versions": "Versions 2.29.51.20170921 and possibly earlier versions are affected.",
         "vulnerability_location": "The vulnerability is located in the `_bfd_elf_slurp_version_tables` function in `bfd/elf.c`.",
         "discovery": "The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer."
