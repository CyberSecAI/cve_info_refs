Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14151:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `opj_mqc_flush` function within the OpenJPEG library. This occurs because the buffer allocated for the compressed data is not large enough to hold all the data written to it during the encoding process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `opj_mqc_flush` function writes past the allocated buffer on the heap, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability.
- Insufficient buffer size calculation: The code fails to correctly predict the required buffer size, leading to undersized memory allocations. Specifically, the size calculation in `opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data` was incorrect, not allocating enough space for the compressed code block data, particularly when flushing the MQC context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malformed JPEG 2000 file could cause a crash due to the heap corruption, effectively denying service.
- Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, the heap overflow might lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed data, although this is not explicitly demonstrated or detailed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JPEG 2000 file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malformed JPEG 2000 file to an application using the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue occurs in the `opj_mqc_flush` function located in `mqc.c`.
- The `opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data` function in `tcd.c` is responsible for allocating the buffer, but the size calculation is insufficient. The commit `afb308b9ccbe129608c9205cf3bb39bbefad90b9` addresses this issue by incrementing the allocated buffer size from +1 to +2.
- The AddressSanitizer output in the provided data clearly shows a heap-buffer-overflow detected by the tool, pinpointing the `opj_mqc_flush` function as the source.
- The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves increasing the size of the allocated buffer to accommodate all compressed data, which includes an additional byte for a potential carry.
- The provided github commit link `afb308b9ccbe129608c9205cf3bb39bbefad90b9` addresses the issue.
- The debian security advisory DSA-4013-1 also includes this CVE.
- A reproducer for the vulnerability is available.

In summary, CVE-2017-14151 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenJPEG library that can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution when processing a crafted JPEG 2000 file. The vulnerability occurs in the `opj_mqc_flush` function due to an incorrect buffer size calculation in `opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data`. The fix involves increasing the allocated buffer size.
