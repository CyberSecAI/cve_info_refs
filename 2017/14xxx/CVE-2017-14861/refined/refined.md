Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14861:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack-overflow in the `Exiv2::Internal::stringFormat[abi:cxx11]` function located in `image.cpp:975`. The overflow occurs during the formatting of a string, specifically within the `vsnprintf` call, due to a deeply nested call stack during the processing of image metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `Exiv2::Internal::stringFormat`.
- Uncontrolled recursive calls to `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` leading to stack exhaustion.
- Improper handling of format string within `vsnprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash of the application due to stack exhaustion.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the format string passed to the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted image file that triggers the deeply nested recursive calls, leading to a large number of calls to `stringFormat` with an attacker controlled format string, causing a stack overflow.
- The specific PoC file provided in the bug report, `009-stack-over`, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious image to the vulnerable exiv2 library for processing. This could be through a web application that utilizes exiv2 to process image metadata, a local image processing application or other means that allow image processing via the exiv2 library.
- The attacker requires the ability to cause exiv2 to process the malicious file.
