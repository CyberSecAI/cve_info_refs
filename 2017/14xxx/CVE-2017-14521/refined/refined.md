Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of file type validation in the Wonder CMS application, allowing users to upload files with arbitrary extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate the file extension of uploaded files, allowing any file type to be uploaded.
- **Security Misconfiguration:** The application is misconfigured in a way that allows arbitrary file uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP shells or trojans, and execute them on the server.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise and server takeover.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can gain access to the server's file system and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the file upload functionality within the Wonder CMS application.
- The attacker needs to access the file upload page after logging in.
- By intercepting the file upload request and tampering with the file extension, the attacker can upload any file type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the Wonder CMS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a proxy).
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of web application attacks, specifically file upload vulnerabilities.
- The attacker must be able to upload the malicious file to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is Wonder CMS version 2.3.1.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a security misconfiguration.
- The blog post provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability and exploit it.
- The exploit-db entry provides the vulnerable code snippet, a proof of concept and the recommended patch to address the bug.
- The recommended patch involves creating a whitelist of allowed file types on the server as well as client side validation.
