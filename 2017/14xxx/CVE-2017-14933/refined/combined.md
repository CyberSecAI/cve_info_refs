# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201811-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.30-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.30-r2** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition or have other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.30-r2"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22210#c0)  skysider    2017-09-26 08:09:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10484](attachment.cgi?id=10484 "poc of large loop") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10484&action=edit "poc of large loop") poc of large loop  I wonder if it's normal or not. When I run "nm: -A -a -l -S -s --special-syms --synthetic --with-symbol-versions hang.elf", it stops for a long time and call realloc persistently.  I look into the problem and find the point, here is the snippet of function read_formatted_entries:    data_count = _bfd_safe_read_leb128 (abfd, buf, &bytes_read, FALSE, buf_end);   buf += bytes_read;   for (datai = 0; datai < data_count; datai++)     {       bfd_byte *format = format_header_data;       struct fileinfo fe;              ......        if (!callback (table, fe.name, fe.dir, fe.time, fe.size)) 	return FALSE;     }  data_count is unsigned long, and callback is function line_info_add_include_dir_stub, and then I debug it with gdb:  (gdb)ptype data_count unsigned long (gdb)p/x data_count 0xfffbfff (gdb)p/x datai 0x01  I'm not sure if there is lack of verifcation or not, it seems abnormal. The poc is attached here. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22210#c1)  Andreas Schwab    2017-09-26 08:36:23 UTC  ``` The file looks like being corrupted:  $ readelf -p .shstrtab hang.elf   String dump of section '.shstrtab':   [     1]  .symtab   [     9]  .

As Andreas explained the current code will handle the corrupt input file correctly, but I also accept your point that it will use up a lot of CPU resources whilst doing so.  So I have checked in a small patch which causes the read_formatted_entries() function to fail before starting the loop, if it knows that the loop cannot possibly terminate successfully.
