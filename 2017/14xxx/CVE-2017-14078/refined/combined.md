## Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise get\_remote\_unlockstring Device\_DeviceId SQL Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-17-764ZDI-CAN-4667

| CVE ID | [CVE-2017-14078](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-14078) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Trend Micro](http://www.trendmicro.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Mobile Security for Enterprise |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['28286']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of the get\_remote\_unlockstring action.

## Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise search\_users\_for\_vpp user\_name SQL Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-17-756ZDI-CAN-4659

| CVE ID | [CVE-2017-14078](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-14078) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Trend Micro](http://www.trendmicro.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Mobile Security for Enterprise |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['28538']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of the search\_users\_for\_vpp action. When parsing the 'user\_name' field, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM. |

### ZDI-17-793ZDI-CAN-4788

| CVE ID | [CVE-2017-14078](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-14078) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Trend Micro](http://www.trendmicro.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Mobile Security for Enterprise |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['28310']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Mobile Security for Enterprise. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of the eas\_agent\_register action. When parsing the 'slink\_id' field, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries in a later remove\_eas\_agent\_info request. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Trend Micro has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
