Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14800

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the iManager JSP pages within Micro Focus Access Manager. Specifically, user-supplied input is reflected back into the response message without being neutralized.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before including it in the generated HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user via the application's response, causing the script to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies or other sensitive data
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Defacing web pages
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs or HTTP requests that contain malicious JavaScript code within the input parameters of iManager JSP pages.
*   An attacker could use social engineering to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link, thus triggering the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs that include JavaScript payloads.
*   The attacker would need to lure a victim into accessing this URL, which usually requires some level of social engineering.
*   The attacker does not need to have direct access to the target server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected product is Micro Focus Access Manager (NAM) version 4.3
*   The vulnerable component is the iManager administrative console.
*   The fix involves sanitation and validation of the input into the iManager JSP pages and is available in Access Manager 4.3 SP3 patch.
