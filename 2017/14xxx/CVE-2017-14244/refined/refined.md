Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-14244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The iBall ADSL2+ Home Router does not properly authenticate access to pages when accessed via their CGI counterparts. Instead of accessing pages like `abcd.html`, an attacker can access `abcd.cgi` without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks when accessing pages through their CGI versions. This allows unauthenticated access to sensitive router functionalities.
*   **Direct Access to CGI Scripts:** The router exposes CGI scripts that should be protected behind authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information about the router's status and configuration.
*   **Ability to Perform Actions:** The attacker can perform various actions without authentication, including:
    *   Resetting the router
    *   Downloading backup configurations
    *   Uploading backup configurations (potentially malicious ones)
    *   Performing firmware upgrades
    *   Modifying PPPoE settings
    *   Changing passwords

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access via Network:** An attacker on the same network as the router can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the router's IP address followed by the .cgi path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
*   The attacker needs to know the router's IP address.
*   The attacker does not need to have valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the iBall ADSL2+ Home Router (Firmware version: FW\_iB-LR7011A\_1.0.2).
*   The vulnerability also affects UTStar WA3002G4 ADSL Broadband Modem (Firmware Version: WA3002G4-0021.01)
*   The techipick.com article mentions that in the UTStar device, the `password.cgi` page contains usernames and passwords in plain text.
*   The exploit-db content provides multiple example URLs of vulnerable cgi pages and a youtube video POC
