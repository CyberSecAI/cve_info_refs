Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `pgxtoimage` function of the OpenJPEG library. This function is responsible for converting a specific image format (PGX) to an OpenJPEG image structure. The root cause lies in the usage of `fscanf` to parse the input file format without proper bounds checking on the input buffers `temp` and `signtmp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `fscanf` function, when used with format specifiers like `%s` or `%[`, is prone to buffer overflows if the input exceeds the size of the provided buffer. In this case, the `temp` and `signtmp` buffers are overflowed when parsing the input file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** While not explicitly stated in the provided information, a stack buffer overflow can potentially be exploited to overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted input file:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted PGX file to trigger the overflow in the `pgxtoimage` function. This file needs to contain overly long strings in the areas where `fscanf` is attempting to parse the image's header (specifically, format specifier `PG%[ \t]%c%c%[ \t+-]%d%[ \t]%d%[ \t]%d`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PGX file that is processed by the vulnerable `openjpeg` library. This can occur if the application uses `openjpeg` to process user-supplied images. The attacker must understand the file format sufficiently to craft the malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The vulnerability affects at least version 2.2.0 of OpenJPEG
- The fix involves adding a maximum field width to the `fscanf` calls: `fscanf(f, "PG%31[ \t]%c%c%31[ \t+-]%d%31[ \t]%d%31[ \t]%d", temp, &endian1, ...)` limiting the size of string read to prevent buffer overflow.
