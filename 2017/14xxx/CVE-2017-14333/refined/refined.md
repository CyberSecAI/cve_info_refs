Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `process_version_sections` function within `readelf.c`. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when processing version sections of an ELF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Integer overflow: The `idx += ent.vn_next` calculation within a loop can overflow, leading to unexpected behavior due to `ent.vn_next` having a large value, where `idx` is a size\_t.
*   Lack of proper bounds checking: The code does not properly check for the potential integer overflow before performing the addition `idx += ent.vn_next`, resulting in `idx` potentially wrapping to a small value and failing to break out of the loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): The integer overflow leads to an infinite loop, causing the `readelf` utility to hang, thus resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Specially crafted ELF file: An attacker can create a malicious ELF file with specific version section data that triggers the integer overflow.
*   File parsing: The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to create a crafted ELF file
*   Ability to entice a user to use `readelf` to analyze the crafted ELF file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `readelf.c` within the `process_version_sections` function.
*   The loop iterates through version entries, using `idx` as the current offset and `ent.vn_next` to advance to the next entry.
*   If `ent.vn_next` has a large value (e.g., `4294967168`) adding it to idx, can cause `idx` to wrap around to a small value, creating an infinite loop, which can be observed in the provided sourceware.org bug report:
    *   `Loop 0: idx = 0; ent.vn_next = 64`
    *   `Loop 1: idx = 64; ent.vn_next = 64`
    *   `Loop 2: idx = 128; ent.vn_next = 4294967168`
    *   `Loop 3: idx = 0; ent.vn_next = 64`
*   The loop continues because the bounds check (`if (idx > (size_t) (endbuf - (char *) eneed))`) fails due to the integer overflow causing `idx` to be a small value, so the loop doesn't break.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed by checking for integer overflows before performing the addition and using `unsigned long` for index variables, and adding a check for invalid `vn_next` fields before adding to `idx`.
*   The provided sourceware.org link includes a crafted ELF file attachment, which can be used to reproduce the bug.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201801-01) lists this CVE along with other binutils vulnerabilities.
