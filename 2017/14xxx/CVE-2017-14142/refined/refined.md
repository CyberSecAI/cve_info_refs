  "CVE-2017-14142": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Kaltura where user input passed via the 'userzone' cookie to the unserialize() function can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). Additionally, it highlights multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities related to insecure input sanitization using strip_tags().",
    "details": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution through unserialize()",
        "description": "The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded cookie secret used to validate the 'userzone' cookie. This allows an attacker to bypass the cookie signature validation, and inject a malicious serialized PHP object, which when unserialized leads to remote code execution.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use of a hardcoded cookie secret",
          "Insecure deserialization of user-controlled data",
           "Lack of input sanitization"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
         "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious 'userzone' cookie with a valid hash signature and embedding a malicious serialized PHP object, and sending it to the server. The getAllEntriesAction has to be called with a valid entry ID to trigger the vulnerable code.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request with a modified cookie."
      },
       {
        "vulnerability": "Authenticated Remote Code Execution through unserialize() in the admin panel",
        "description": "The admin panel provides a function 'wiki_decode' which takes user input and passes it to unserialize() after some encoding. This can be exploited by passing a base64 encoded malicious serialized object.",
          "weaknesses": [
           "Insecure deserialization of user-controlled data"
        ],
         "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
          "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object, base64 encoding it and sending it to the admin panel using the 'wiki_decode' function.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user."
      },
      {
        "vulnerability": "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities under the API path",
        "description": "The use of PHP's strip_tags() function to sanitize user input is insufficient and allows for XSS attacks. This was found in the bigRedButton.php script.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inadequate input sanitization using strip_tags()",
           "Lack of context-aware output encoding"
        ],
        "impact": "Cross-site scripting, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.",
        "attack_vector": "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable parameters, such as 'partnerId' in bigRedButton.php",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the server with a malicious script as parameter"
      }
    ],
     "remediation": "Kaltura 13.2.0 was released to fix these vulnerabilities. The fix involves strict input validation, as seen in the code changes provided, with the introduction of `safeGetInput` function and usage of regular expression patterns to enforce data type. The `strip_tags` is replaced by `safeGetInput` with a pattern that allows only specific chars, preventing XSS. Input to unserialize() is not user controlled anymore."
