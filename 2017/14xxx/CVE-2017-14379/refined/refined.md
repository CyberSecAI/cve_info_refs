```
Root cause of vulnerability: The RSA Authentication Manager Security Console is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the userâ€™s browser session within the context of the RSA Authentication Manager application. This could lead to the compromise of the affected system.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the RSA Authentication Manager Security Console. The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code which is then stored and executed in the user's browser.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a malicious user with the ability to inject code into the vulnerable component. The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) to be able to inject the malicious code and the user needs to perform an action (UI:R).
