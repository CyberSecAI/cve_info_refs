# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

* [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

                 CVE-2017-14767

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FFmpeg multimedia
framework, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed Real, MV, RL2, ASF, Apple HLS,
Phantom Cine, MXF, NSV, MOV or RTP H.264 files/streams are processed.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:3.2.8-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.

## Description

In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in asf\_read\_marker() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted ASF file, which claims a large "name\_len" or "count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the loops over the name and markers would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside these loops.

                 CVE-2018-14394 CVE-2018-1999010

Several security vulnerabilities were corrected in the libav
multimedia library which may lead to a denial-of-service, information
disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed file is
processed.

CVE-2017-9993

    Libav does not properly restrict HTTP Live Streaming filename
    extensions and demuxer names, which allows attackers to read
    arbitrary files via crafted playlist data.

CVE-2017-9994

    libavcodec/webp.c in Libav does not ensure that pix_fmt is set,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via a crafted file, related to the
    vp8_decode_mb_row_no_filter and pred8x8_128_dc_8_c functions.

CVE-2017-14055

    Denial-of-service in mv_read_header() due to lack of an EOF (End of
    File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.

CVE-2017-14056

    Denial-of-service in rl2_read_header() due to lack of an EOF
    (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.

CVE-2017-14057

    Denial-of-service in asf_read_marker() due to lack of an EOF
   (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption.

CVE-2017-14170

    Denial-of-service in mxf_read_index_entry_array() due to lack of an
    EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.

CVE-2017-14171

    Denial-of-service in nsv_parse_NSVf_header() due to lack of an EOF
   (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.

CVE-2017-14767

    The sdp_parse_fmtp_config_h264 function in
    libavformat/rtpdec_h264.c mishandles empty sprop-parameter-sets
    values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (heap buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
    a crafted sdp file.

CVE-2017-15672

    The read_header function in libavcodec/ffv1dec.c allows remote
    attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted MP4 file, which
    triggers an out-of-bounds read.

CVE-2017-17130

    The ff_free_picture_tables function in libavcodec/mpegpicture.c
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via a crafted file, related to
    vc1_decode_i_blocks_adv.

CVE-2018-6621

    The decode_frame function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in Libav allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out of array read)
    via a crafted AVI file.

CVE-2018-7557

    The decode_init function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in
    Libav allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (Out of array read) via an AVI file with crafted dimensions within
    chroma subsampling data.

CVE-2018-14394

    libavformat/movenc.c in Libav allows attackers to cause a
    denial of service (application crash caused by a divide-by-zero
    error) with a user crafted Waveform audio file.

CVE-2018-1999010

    Libav contains multiple out of array access vulnerabilities in the
    mms protocol that can result in attackers accessing out of bound
    data.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
6:11.12-1~deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.
