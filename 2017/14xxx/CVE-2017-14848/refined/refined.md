{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'id' and 'employee_id' parameters within the WPHRM WordPress plugin. This allows an employee user to inject SQL commands through these parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion from the database. Sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data stored in the database could be compromised.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL payloads injected into specific parameters, namely 'id' and 'employee_id'. The vulnerable URLs are within the 'hr-dashboard' functionality of the plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated employee user of the WordPress application running the vulnerable WPHRM plugin."
