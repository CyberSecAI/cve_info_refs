- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The administration user deletion resource in Atlassian FishEye and Crucible does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `uname` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into the `uname` parameter of the administration user deletion resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need special privileges. The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and inject it into the vulnerable parameter.
