Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14729:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `_bfd_x86_elf_get_synthetic_symtab` function, specifically when handling Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) entries. The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper handling of corrupted PLT entries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A memory buffer allocated on the heap is overwritten due to a missing bounds check or improper size calculation.
- **Corrupted PLT Handling:** The code doesn't guard against corrupted PLT entries, allowing for duplicate entries to be processed. This leads to the heap buffer overflow when the code tries to write information for multiple instances of the same symbol.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** A heap-based buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully craft the input to overwrite sensitive data in memory, such as function pointers.
- **Denial of service:** At the very least, this bug can crash the `nm` utility (and potentially other tools that use the vulnerable function), causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious ELF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious ELF file containing corrupted PLT entries. When this file is processed by `nm` (or another program using the vulnerable library), the overflow occurs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious ELF file as input to the vulnerable utility.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The fix involves setting a variable to NULL after processing a PLT entry to prevent the same entry from being processed again, which guards against corrupted PLTs.
- The bug is present in the `binutils` package, version 2.30 and possibly older.
- The fix was applied to both the master branch and the 2.29 branch.
- The vulnerability was reported by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
- The vulnerable code is located in `elfxx-x86.c`, `elf32-i386.c` and `elf64-x86-64.c` within the `bfd` library of `binutils`.
