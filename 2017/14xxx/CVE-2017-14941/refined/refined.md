{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "JasperReports stores database connection passwords in cleartext within the HTML source code of the data source edit page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext password storage",
      "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain access to database connection strings, usernames, and passwords by viewing the HTML source code of a data source edit page, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the JasperReports application as a logged-in user",
      "Navigating to the data source edit page",
      "Viewing the HTML source code of the page"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the JasperReports application and be able to navigate the user interface.",
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in JasperReports version 4.7. When editing a Data Source on /jasperserver-pro/flow.html, the application renders the database connection string, username, and password directly into the HTML form in cleartext. An attacker can view the HTML source code of the page to extract the sensitive data. The vulnerability was addressed by loading a substitute value into password HTML form."
