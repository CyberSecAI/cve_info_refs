Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `physical.php` file within the `/admin/app/physical/` directory of MetInfo version 5.3.17.
*   The `fingerprintdo` action within this file takes a user-controlled variable `$f_filename` and passes it to the `fingerprint()` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on the `$f_filename` variable, allowing an attacker to manipulate it with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`).
*   **Unrestricted File Read:** The `fingerprint()` function uses `parse_ini_file()` on the provided `$fileback` (which is the attacker-controlled `$f_filename`) without verifying its path. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read sensitive configuration files, source code, and other files that the web server has access to, potentially revealing confidential information like database credentials, API keys, etc.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows the attacker to gain insights into the system's inner workings and configuration, which can be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a specific HTTP request to the `physical.php` file, setting the `action` parameter to `fingerprintdo`, and setting the `f_filename` parameter to a path containing directory traversal sequences.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `$f_filename` variable is passed as a parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to easily manipulate it to read different files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MetInfo instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs knowledge of the location of `physical.php`.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The provided content suggests this vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication since there is no mention of any required login or authorization.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `fingerprintdo` action directly uses `file_exists()` to verify the existence of `$f_filename`. The vulnerability exists when `file_exists()` returns true. Then the path is passed to `fingerprint()` function.
*   The `fingerprint()` function uses `parse_ini_file()` without proper path validation. This causes a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Example PoC:**

The content provides the following PoC URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1/admin/app/physical/physical.php?action=fingerprintdo&f_filename=../../../../../bin/php/php5.6.25/php.ini
```

This URL exploits the vulnerability to read the `php.ini` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also suggests that deleting the cache and update folder is performed before the file read.
*   The content is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It includes code snippets, a PoC URL, and an explanation of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
