Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14100:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `app_minivm` module in Asterisk uses the caller-id name and number as part of a string passed to the OS shell for execution. Because the caller-id can be controlled by an attacker, this enables shell command injection. Specifically, the `externnotify` program configuration option within the `app_minivm` module is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command injection:** The primary weakness is the use of untrusted input (caller-id name and number) to construct a command string that is then executed by the OS shell.
- **Insecure use of `ast_safe_system` and `popen`:** The issue arises because functions like `ast_safe_system` and `popen` do not properly protect against command injection.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the caller-id input before using it in the command string.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary command execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Asterisk server.
- **System compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the Asterisk process, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.
- **Data breach/manipulation:** An attacker could access sensitive data on the server, or manipulate call records.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious caller-id:** An attacker can set a specially crafted caller-id name or number through a SIP call or similar method.
- **Dialplan manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the dialplan to invoke the vulnerable `app_minivm` application with the malicious caller-id.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to set caller ID:** An attacker needs to be able to control the caller-id information associated with a call.
- **Knowledge of dialplan:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the Asterisk dialplan to potentially target the vulnerable function. However, since the vulnerability affects modules used in common configurations, exploiting it does not require special dialplan knowledge from the attacker if a vulnerable dialplan is already in place.
- **Authenticated session:** The advisory indicates the susceptibility is via "Remote Authenticated Sessions." This may imply that the attacker needs to have some form of authentication (like a SIP account) to initiate a call to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Asterisk versions 11.x, 13.x, and 14.x, as well as their certified versions.
- Patches were made to use a safer system call (`ast_safe_execvp`) that passes arguments in an array, preventing shell interpretation of the command string.
- The issue was addressed in Asterisk versions 11.25.2, 13.17.1, and 14.6.1 and their certified equivalents.
- Several modules are mentioned as vulnerable if the admin gets parameters from untrusted values: `app_system`, `app_mixmonitor`, `func_shell`, and `res_monitor`.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability and its implications.
