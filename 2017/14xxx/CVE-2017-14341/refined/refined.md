Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ReadWPGImage` function within the `wpg.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, a crafted WPG image file can control the `Rec.RecordLength` value, which is later used to determine the size of data processed by the `ExtractPostscript` function.  The `ExtractPostscript` function then iterates based on this size, reading bytes from the input and writing them to a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unbounded Loop:**  The `while (PS_Size-- > 0)` loop in `ExtractPostscript` relies on `PS_Size`, which is derived from the attacker-controlled `Rec.RecordLength`.  A large `Rec.RecordLength` value leads to a very large `PS_Size`, causing the loop to iterate excessively.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is insufficient validation of the `Rec.RecordLength` value before it is used to calculate `PS_Size`. While a check for `Rec.RecordLength > 8` exists, it does not prevent very large values. The fix commit adds a check that `Rec.RecordLength` is smaller than the size of the blob.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The unbounded loop in `ExtractPostscript` leads to CPU exhaustion, effectively causing a denial of service on the system processing the malformed WPG image.
*   **Possible I/O failure:** The excessive reads in ExtractPostscript may cause I/O errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed WPG Image File:** An attacker crafts a WPG image file with a large `Rec.RecordLength` value to trigger the excessive loop in the `ExtractPostscript` function.
*   **Image Processing:** The crafted image is processed by ImageMagick (e.g., using the `identify` command).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malformed WPG file:** An attacker must be able to provide the specially crafted image to a system using ImageMagick. This could occur via various means such as uploading it to a web server or sending it via email.
*   **Target interaction:**  The victim must use ImageMagick to process the attacker's malformed image.

**Additional Notes:**

* The fix involves adding a check `if (Rec.RecordLength > GetBlobSize(image))` to verify if the `Rec.RecordLength` is larger than the actual size of the image. If it is, a `CorruptImageError` is thrown.

* The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is also tracked under Debian bug IDs: 867778 and 878548.
