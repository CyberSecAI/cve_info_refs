The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in ASUS routers, but only one of them could be related to CVE-2017-14698. Since the CVE description is a placeholder, the relationship needs to be confirmed when the CVE description is available. The identified vulnerability is:

**1. Unauthenticated Password Reset Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The password reset functionality in the ASUS router's web interface does not properly authenticate requests.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper authentication/authorization controls on the password reset form.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with access to the router's web interface (either on the local network or remotely if the web interface is exposed) can change the password of any user, including the administrator, gaining full control of the device. This would allow them to access the router's settings and potentially gain access to the local network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the password reset form, modifying the `http_passwd` field with a new password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the router's web interface, no authentication is required.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying error messages.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Improper input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL and when a victim visits the crafted URL, the injected code would execute in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing a non-existent resource with a malicious script in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send or trick a user to open a crafted URL.

**3. XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The AiCloud service incorrectly parses XML, allowing external entities to be included.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper XML parsing and lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access local files on the router's filesystem by including malicious external entities in XML requests to the AiCloud service. This could expose sensitive system files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted XML request to specific AiCloud endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the router's web interface (specifically the AiCloud service on port 449).

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post identifies several affected ASUS router models.
* ASUS was notified and released patches for these issues.
* The XSS vulnerability is described as a "boring" vulnerability, suggesting it is a basic XSS found in error pages.
* The password reset vulnerability is considered the most critical vulnerability identified.
* The XXE vulnerabilities in the AiCloud service allow for local file disclosure.
* The blog post does not mention a specific CVE for each of the vulnerabilities.
*The provided information indicates that there is a missing CVE for the described vulnerabilities, therefore this is not a description of CVE-2017-14698, but it might be related.
