Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14421:

**Relates to CVE:** Yes, this content specifically discusses CVE-2017-14421 under the "LAN - revB - Backdoor access" section.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the inclusion of a telnet daemon (`mfcd`) as a backdoor in the firmware of D-Link 850L revision B routers. This backdoor is enabled by default if the router is reset or if the `devconfsize` is equal to 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor Account:** A hardcoded username (`Alphanetworks`) and password (`wrgac25_dlink.2013gui_dir850l`) are used to access the telnet daemon, granting root shell access.
- **Unnecessary Service:** The telnet daemon (`mfcd`) is not a standard service and should not be running on the device by default.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The telnet daemon is accessible from the LAN side without any restrictions, meaning any device on the local network can attempt to connect to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain a root shell on the affected router. This provides complete control over the router, enabling the attacker to:
- Access and modify router configurations.
- Intercept and modify network traffic.
- Install malware on the device.
- Use the router as a bot in a botnet.
- Pivot to other devices on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- **Telnet Client:** A simple telnet client can be used to connect to the backdoor and provide login credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same LAN as the vulnerable D-Link 850L revision B router.
- The attacker must be able to establish a TCP connection to the router on the default telnet port (usually 23).
- The attacker needs to know the hardcoded credentials to log in (username `Alphanetworks`, password `wrgac25_dlink.2013gui_dir850l`).

**Additional Details:**
- The `mfcd` binary is launched by the `/etc/init0.d/S80mfcd.sh` script at boot time.
- The backdoor is only enabled when certain conditions are met, mainly if the router is reset or if the `devconfsize` is equal to 0.
- The vulnerability is specific to revision B of the D-Link 850L router.
