Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `Exiv2::Jp2Image::readMetadata` function, specifically at `jp2image.cpp:277`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This is due to improper handling of the size of data being read, leading to `memcpy` writing past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** A heap overflow could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting function pointers or other critical data structures on the heap.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate effect observed was a crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting a heap buffer overflow. This crash can be leveraged as a denial of service if an attacker can provide malformed input to trigger the issue.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious file input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JP2 image file. The `readMetadata` function is invoked when processing these files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide or have the vulnerable application process a malformed JP2 file. This can be done locally (if the attacker has access to the system), remotely (if the application is accessible remotely such as over a webserver or email), or by social engineering (convincing the user to open the file).
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to trigger this vulnerability if the application can be run in their context with a specially crafted file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer, which detected the heap-buffer-overflow.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `0.27` of `exiv2`.
- The PoC file is available as an attachment in the bug report, enabling verification of the vulnerability.
- The fix was backported to the 0.26 branch according to the github issue comments.
- The bugzilla report is marked as `CLOSED ERRATA`, which links to a related Red Hat Security Advisory: [RHSA-2019:2101](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2101).
