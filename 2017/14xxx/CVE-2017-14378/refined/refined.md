- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK for C versions 8.5 and 8.6 has an error handling flaw where return codes from the API/SDK are not properly handled by the application when used in TCP asynchronous mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper error handling of return codes when using the API/SDK in TCP asynchronous mode can lead to authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to authentication bypass.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability occurs when the API/SDK is used in TCP asynchronous mode, and the return codes are not correctly handled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to exploit the application's incorrect handling of the API/SDK return codes in a TCP asynchronous context. This implies the attacker needs to interact with the application in a way that triggers the vulnerable error handling path.
