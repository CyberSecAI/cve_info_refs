ESA-2017-146: RSA® Authentication Agent SDK for C Error Handling Vulnerability

EMC Identifier:  ESA-2017-146
CVE Identifier:  CVE-2017-14378

Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) (see note below)

Affected Products:
        .       RSA® Authentication Agent API 8.5 for C
        .       RSA® Authentication Agent SDK 8.6 for C

Summary:
A security vulnerability in RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK for C versions 8.5 and 8.6 could potentially lead to
authentication bypass in certain limited implementations.

Details:
RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK 8.5/8.6 for C has an error handling flaw that could lead to authentication bypass in
certain limited implementations. This issue will occur when the API/SDK is used in TCP asynchronous mode and return
codes from the API/SDK are not handled properly by the application.

Implementations handling the API/SDK return codes appropriately (per coding guidelines documented in the  RSA
Authentication Agent API for C Developer's Guide) are not vulnerable. Refer to KB article 000035762
(<https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-85061>) for information on how to inspect your implementation and additional
guidance on proper handling of API/SDK return codes.

For clarification purposes, this issue does not impact:
        .       RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK for Java
        .       RSA Authentication Agent API for C versions prior to v8.5
        .       RSA Authentication Manager SDK and RSA SecurID® Mobile SDK.

Note: The CVSSv3 base score and vectors provided above are calculated based on maximum impact for vulnerable
implementations. RSA recommends that all impacted customers take into account the base score (re-calculated for their
own vulnerable implementation) and any temporal and/or environmental scores that may be relevant to their environment
to assess their overall risk.

Recommendation:
The following releases contain resolution for this vulnerability:
        .       RSA Authentication Agent API 8.5.1 for C
        .       RSA Authentication Agent SDK 8.6.1 for C

RSA recommends all impacted customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity and/or ensure that their implementation of
the API/SDK conforms to the coding guidelines documented in the RSA Authentication Agent API for C Developer's Guide.
RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK downloads and documentation can be found at
<https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-40601#agents>

Severity Rating:
For an explanation of Severity Ratings, refer to the Security Advisories Severity Rating  knowledge base article
(<https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-47147>). RSA recommends all customers take into account both the base score and any
relevant temporal and environmental scores which may impact the potential severity associated with particular security
vulnerability.

EOPS Policy:
RSA has a defined End of Primary Support policy associated with all major versions. Please refer to the Product Version
Life Cycle (<https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-40387>) for additional details.
