```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `MMM::Agent::Helpers::Network::clear_ip()` function, used to remove IP addresses, constructs a shell command using an unsanitized IP address. This allows for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the IP address in the `clear_ip()` function when constructing shell commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the `mmm_agentd` process, typically root, which can lead to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a specially crafted MMM protocol message, specifically using the `SET_STATUS` message to define a role with a malicious IP address. This then invokes the vulnerable function via the `clear_ip` helper command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the `mmm_agentd` process. No authentication is required by default."
