Title: OpenText Documentum Administrator and Webtop - Open Redirection
Author: Jakub Palaczynski
Date: 24. September 2017
CVE (Administrator): CVE-2017-14524
CVE (Webtop): CVE-2017-14525

Affected software:
==================
Documentum Administrator
Documentum Webtop

Exploit was tested on:
======================
Documentum Administrator version 7.2.0180.0055
Documentum Webtop version 6.8.0160.0073
Other versions may also be vulnerable.

Open Redirection - 2 instances:
========================

1. First instance:
It is possible to frame custom/malicious website on a trusted domain.
This way an attacker may for example steal credentials via creating
fake login form or redirect users to a malicious website.

Proof of Concept:
<https://DOCUMENTUM/xda/help/en/default.htm?startat=//127.0.0.1/custom.html>

2. Second instance:
It is possible to redirect user to custom website. Besides redirection
it also allows for stealing sensitive data - before redirection takes
place application appends username and base64 encoded user's encrypted
password ("ticket" parameter).

Proof of Concept:
Please note that PoC below works only in Internet Explorer browser as
only this browser treats /%09/ as //, which makes redirection work.

```

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs in the `startat` and `redirectUrl` parameters, leading to open redirection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirection, Insecure handling of user input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites. In the second instance, sensitive user data (username and base64 encoded encrypted password) is exposed before redirection, potentially leading to credential theft. Framing trusted domain with attacker controlled content for credential harvesting is also possible.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs with `startat` parameter in the first instance, and `redirectUrl` parameter in the second instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs. They don't need to be authenticated but needs a vulnerable server address.
