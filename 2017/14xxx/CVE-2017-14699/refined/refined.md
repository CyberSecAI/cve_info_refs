The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in ASUS routers, including one that could be related to CVE-2017-14699, although this cannot be confirmed without the CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the error page when accessing a non-existent resource without authentication.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks when a user accesses a crafted URL.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user must visit a specially crafted URL, such as `https://<IP>/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(window.location.path)%3C/script%3E`.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that injects malicious javascript.

**2. Unauthenticated Password Reset**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization in the password reset form. The `http_passwd` parameter can be modified to change any user's password.
*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure direct object reference leading to unauthorized password change.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can change the password of any user, including the administrator, and gain control of the router.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the password reset form, modifying the `http_passwd` field, without any authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router and have access to the application's web interface, and be able to craft a POST request.

**3. XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerabilities in AiCloud Service**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper XML input validation when processing user requests in AiCloud.
*   **Vulnerability:** XXE vulnerabilities allowing for access to local system files.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the router's file system, such as `/etc/passwd`, by injecting malicious XML code containing external entity declarations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** 
    *   Sending a crafted XML payload within a POST request to the  `https://<IP>:<PORT>/smb/css/setting.html` resource.
    *   Sending a crafted XML payload within a POST request to another unspecified resource, which the provided content shows how the crafted xml request looks like.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to access the AiCloud service, typically on port 449, and have the ability to modify the XML payloads sent to the server. This would require enabling the AiCloud service first, and network access to port 449.
