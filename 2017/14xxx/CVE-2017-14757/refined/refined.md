Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of prepared statements in the application's SQL queries. This allows for direct injection of SQL code through user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks because it directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `jobRunId` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Retrieval:** A successful attacker could retrieve sensitive data from the application's database by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Error-Based Data Extraction:** The error messages expose the full query and injection point, which could be leveraged for error-based SQL injection techniques to extract information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/xDashboard/html/jobhistory/downloadSupportFile.action` endpoint. The `jobRunId` parameter within the URL is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** Basic SQL knowledge is required to craft malicious SQL queries for injection.
*   **Target URL knowledge**: The attacker needs to know the path `/xDashboard/html/jobhistory/downloadSupportFile.action` to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable parameter is `jobRunId`
* The vulnerability is present in OpenText Document Sciences xPression (formerly EMC Document Sciences xPression) v4.5SP1 Patch 13. Older versions might be affected as well.
* The proof of concept URLs show how to inject into the SQL query.
* Example vulnerable SQL query:
`SELECT  JOBRUN_ID, JOB_NAME, PUBLISH_PROFILE, PUBLISH_TYPE, START_TIME, END_TIME, HAS_DISTRIBUTION, DISTRIBUTION_NUMBER, STATUS, ERROR, REPORTING_LEVEL, THREAD_ID, JOB_ID FROM T_JOBRUN WHERE JOBRUN_ID='[INJECTED VALUE]';`
