The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14967.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the inputted output buffer address (`Irp->UserBuffer`) being saved on the stack and later used without validation as an argument.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an arbitrary write vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary write in the kernel, leading to potential privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered via a specific IOCTL (0x83000080).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver (`ntguard.sys` or `ntguard_x64.sys`). This typically requires local access to the system.
