        "vulnerability": "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Untrusted URL Invocation",
           "Improper handling of external resources",
           "Lack of user confirmation before accessing external resources"

        "impact": "Attackers could access resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "Embedding malicious images or code within a PDF document"
         ],

         "vulnerability": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the style attribute of FileAttachment annotation objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use-After-Free",
          "Missing object validation before operations"

          "Malicious PDF file",
          "Malicious web page"

         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file or host a malicious web page, and the user must open or visit the malicious content.",
        "additional_details": "The specific flaw exists within the style attribute of FileAttachment annotation objects."
       }
    ],
     "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Foxit Reader related to handling of XFA documents and FileAttachment annotations leading to remote code execution through untrusted URL invocation or use-after-free due to improper object validation, triggered by opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious webpage."
