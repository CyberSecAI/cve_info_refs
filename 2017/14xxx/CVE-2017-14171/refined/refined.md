Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14171

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing End-of-File (EOF) check within the `nsv_parse_NSVf_header()` function in `libavformat/nsvdec.c` in FFmpeg. Specifically, the code iterates over a `table_entries_used` field without verifying if it has reached the end of the file, thus reading beyond the file boundary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing EOF Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of an EOF check within a loop that reads file data based on the `table_entries_used` field.
- **Uncontrolled Loop:** When a crafted NSV file specifies a large `table_entries_used` value but does not provide enough backing data, the loop continues to read data past the end of the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition due to the excessive CPU consumption caused by the unbounded loop. The lack of EOF check leads to the process consuming a large amount of CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted NSV File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted NSV file. This file has a header that claims a large value for `table_entries_used` but contains less backing data than it claims.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the crafted NSV file to the vulnerable FFmpeg application. No specific position or capabilities of the attacker are mentioned other than that they need to be able to supply a crafted file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in FFmpeg versions 2.4 and 3.3.3
- A patch for the vulnerability was introduced in commit `c24bcb553650b91e9eff15ef6e54ca73de2453b7` by adding an EOF check inside the loop.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Xiaohei and Wangchu from Alibaba Security Team.
- This issue was addressed in Debian security updates DSA-3996-1 for the stable distribution (stretch) and DLA 1630-1 for Debian 8 (Jessie).
