Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-14498

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation and output sanitization when uploading SVG files. The SilverStripe CMS allows users to upload SVG files without properly sanitizing them. This allows for embedding malicious JavaScript code within the SVG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS. Malicious JavaScript code embedded in uploaded SVG files can be executed when a user views or interacts with the image through the CMS.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system doesn't sanitize the SVG file content upon upload.
*   **Lack of Output Sanitization**: The system does not properly sanitize the output of the uploaded file, allowing for execution of embedded javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and CMS functionalities.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can manipulate data within the CMS or the user's browser, potentially causing data loss or corruption.
*   **Redirects:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious SVG files through the CMS's file upload functionalities.
*   **Content Editor "Insert Media" Option**: An attacker can upload a malicious SVG through the insert image option when creating or editing content.
*   **Admin Panel (/admin/assets/add/)**: An attacker can upload a malicious SVG through the assets management panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **CMS Access:** An attacker needs access to the CMS interface. A low privilege user such as a content editor is enough to exploit this vulnerability
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker must have the ability to upload files.
*   **Knowledge of SVG Embedding:** The attacker needs to know how to embed JavaScript within SVG files.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves disabling SVG uploads by default.
*   The advisory mentions that there are two vulnerable instances of the same vulnerability: the "Insert Media" option in the content editor and the path "/admin/assets/add/".
*   The issue was initially reported as SS-2016-017 but was later corrected to SS-2017-017.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in SilverStripe CMS version 3.6.1.
*   A workaround includes not allowing SVG file uploads.
