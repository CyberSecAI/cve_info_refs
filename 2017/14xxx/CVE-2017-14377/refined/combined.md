ESA-2017-145: RSA® Authentication Agent for Web for Apache Web Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

EMC Identifier:  ESA-2017-145

CVE Identifier:  CVE-2017-14377

Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

Affected Products:
        .       RSA® Authentication Agent for Web: Apache Web Server version 8.0
        .       RSA® Authentication Agent for Web: Apache Web Server version 8.0.1 prior to Build 618

Summary:
A security vulnerability in RSA Authentication Agent for Web for Apache Web Server could potentially lead to
authentication bypass.

Details:
Due to an improper input validation flaw in RSA Authentication Agent for Web for Apache Web Server, a remote malicious
user can potentially bypass user authentication and gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the agent. The
privilege level of an unauthorized user who gains access depends on the authorization policy set by the underlying
application that is using the agent.

This vulnerability is only present when the RSA Authentication Agent for Web for Apache Web Server is configured to use
the TCP protocol to communicate with the RSA Authentication Manager server. UDP implementation, which is the default
configuration, is not vulnerable.  Please refer to the RSA Authentication Agent 8.x for Web for Apache Web Server
Installation and Configuration Guide for configuration details.

Recommendation:
