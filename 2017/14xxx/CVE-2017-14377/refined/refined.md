- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in RSA Authentication Agent for Web for Apache Web Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote malicious user can bypass user authentication and gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the agent. The privilege level of the unauthorized user depends on the authorization policy of the underlying application.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote malicious user. The vulnerability is only present when the RSA Authentication Agent for Web is configured to use the TCP protocol to communicate with the RSA Authentication Manager server.
