The provided content indicates that CVE-2017-14721 is a **path traversal vulnerability** in the file unzipping code of WordPress.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how WordPress handles file paths during the unzipping process. Specifically, the code was not properly sanitizing or validating the file paths within the ZIP archive, potentially allowing an attacker to specify paths that would overwrite or create files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The primary vulnerability is path traversal, which means that an attacker can manipulate input (in this case, file paths within a ZIP archive) to access or modify files/directories that they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite: An attacker could overwrite existing files with malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Creation of arbitrary files and directories: An attacker could create files and directories in sensitive locations on the server, leading to various forms of attack, including information disclosure, denial of service or further code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious ZIP archive: An attacker could create a specially crafted ZIP file containing files with manipulated pathnames (e.g., using "../" sequences) and upload this file through a vulnerable feature of WordPress, most likely during plugin or theme installation or update.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload a ZIP file to the WordPress server. This could be achieved through access to an administrative interface or, in some cases, via other vulnerabilities that allow file uploads.
- Some form of user interaction may also be needed (i.e. administrator initiating the zip process), based on the context where the unzipping operation is taking place.
