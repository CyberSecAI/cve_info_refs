{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tpacket_rcv()` function in `net/packet/af_packet.c` does not properly handle vnet headers when calculating the buffer offset, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with `CAP_NET_RAW` capability can cause a denial of service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have other unspecified impacts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A number of socket-related syscalls can be made to set up a configuration when each packet received by a network interface can cause writing up to 10 bytes to a kernel memory outside of a kernel buffer."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability, which usually requires root or a user namespace with network access. Specifically, the attacker must be able to open a PF_PACKET+SOCK_RAW socket."
