# The next step for LGTM.com: GitHub code scanning!

Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.com’s key features—and more! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

* Share:

Three years ago, [the team that built LGTM.com joined GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/). From that moment on, we have worked tirelessly to natively integrate its underlying CodeQL analysis technology into GitHub. In 2020, GitHub code scanning was [launched](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security) in public beta, and later that year it became [generally available](https://github.blog/2020-09-30-code-scanning-is-now-available/) for everyone. GitHub code scanning is powered by the very same analysis engine: CodeQL.

We’ve since continued to invest in CodeQL and GitHub code scanning. Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.com’s key features—and [more](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/)! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

### End of August 2022: no more user sign-ups and new repositories

Starting at the end of August, LGTM.com will no longer accept new user sign-ups. It will also no longer be possible to add new repositories for analysis to LGTM.com. Existing users will continue to be able to log in and use LGTM.com, and the analysis of existing repositories will continue to work. However, [historical analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/viewing-history-of-project) will no longer be performed–only new commits will be analyzed.

### October: help migrate repositories to GitHub code scanning

We will do our best to help migrate repositories that actively use LGTM.com to flag potential security issues in their pull requests. For those repositories, we will create pull requests that add a [GitHub Actions workflow that runs code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually). Once that configuration file is merged, the repository’s source code (and future pull requests) will be scanned by GitHub code scanning. GitHub code scanning will flag any potential security issues [in pull requests](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-02-users-can-view-and-comment-on-code-scanning-alerts-on-the-conversation-tab-in-a-pull-request/) and on the repository’s [security tab](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository). Once that’s all working as it should, you can disable the LGTM.com integration.

Some repositories make use of advanced LGTM.com build and analysis configurations. In such cases, we might not be able to automatically propose a GitHub Actions workflow to set up code scanning. We will notify such repositories directly.

### End of November: new commits and pull requests are no longer analyzed

At the end of November, LGTM.com will stop fetching new commits for the repositories that it analyzes. It will also stop analyzing pull requests on GitHub.com. Repositories that still use LGTM.com’s pull request analysis in the week(s) leading up to this deprecation phase will be reminded through a message in the pull request comments that are posted by LGTM.com.

### 16th of December: LGTM.com will be shut down

From the 16th of December, LGTM.com will no longer be available. This includes but is not limited to:

* [LGTM.com code quality badges](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/adding-badges-to-project-readme-files)
* The LGTM query console (including historical results)
* The LGTM documentation
* All LGTM.com APIs

## So long and thanks for all the fish!

On behalf of the entire LGTM.com team, we’d like to thank you all for joining us on this wonderful journey. From launching LGTM.com back in 2017, all the way through [GitHub’s acquisition of Semmle in 2019](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/), the subsequent [launch of GitHub code scanning](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security), and all the [improvements we’ve since shipped](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/): it’s been an absolutely amazing journey. Thank you!

## Summary

Here are listed the several security issues reported and the related enhancements.

## Vulnerability CVE-2017-14949

Restlet Framework XEE vulnerability is referenced as [CVE-2017-14949](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14949).

**Note:** Version 2.3.12 introduced enhancement to to circumvent this vulnerability, as well as newer versions also include the fix.

Thanks to Man Yue Mo of [Semmle Inc.](https://semmle.com/) and [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com) for reporting us this issue and providing assistance while fixing it.

### Identified vulnerabilities

Are subject to XEE vulnerability, user codes that rely on the "XML" Restlet Framework extension.

### Security enhancements

The XmlRepresentation (and inherited DOMRepresentation and SaxRepresentation), JacksonRepresentation classes and subclasses leverage one attribute called "expandingEntityRefs". This attribute has been introduced when handling [vulnerability CVE-2014-1868](#vulnerability-cve-2014-1868). Unfortunately, setting this attribute to `false` did not prevent properly to expand external entities.
The security fix ensures incoming XML streams are parsed safely in order to block expansion of entities.

## Vulnerability CVE-2017-14868

Restlet Framework XEE vulnerability is referenced as [CVE-2017-14868](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14868).

**Note:** Version 2.3.11 introduced enhancement to to circumvent this vulnerability, as well as newer versions also include the fix.

Thanks to Man Yue Mo of [Semmle Inc.](https://semmle.com/) and [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com) for reporting us this issue and providing assistance while fixing it.

### Identified vulnerabilities

Are subject to XEE vulnerability, user codes that rely on the "Jax-rs" Restlet Framework extension.

### Security enhancements

The security fix ensures incoming XML streams are parsed safely in order to block expansion of entities.

##### Technical details

The issue was introduced by external library `simple-xml`. At the time of writing, this library has been forked in order to provide a fix quickly. The maintenance team has been contacted, and we wait for their answer.

## Vulnerability CVE-2014-1868

Restlet Framework XEE vulnerability is referenced as [CVE-2014-1868](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1868).

**Note:** Versions 2.1.7 and 2.2 RC1 introduced enhancements and default behaviors to circumvent this vulnerability, as well as newer versions also include the fix.

For details regarding XEE (XML ENTITY EXPANSION), see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs>. Thanks to Alvaro Munoz from HP Fortify for reporting the issue and his assistance with the CVE process.

### Identified vulnerabilities

Are subject to XEE vulnerability, user codes that rely on the following Restlet Framework extensions :

* "xml" extension,
* "atom", "javamail", "lucene", "odata", "openid", "rdf", "wadl", "xdb" that directly depends on the "xml" extension.
* "jackson", "jaxb", "jibx", "xstream", "rome" that provides automatic converters.

### Security enhancements

#### If your code leverages XMLRepresentation or XML serializers

The following Restlet Framework components are concerned :

* XMLRepresentation and its sub classes : SaxRepresentation, DomRepresentation.
* but also representations that help handling serialization/deserializations from class instances to XML streams : JacksonRepresentation, JibxRepresentation, XStreamRepresentation, SyndFeedRepresentation (rome).

The security fix ensures incoming XML streams are parsed safely : at the representation level, we've added specific attributes, accessors and constructors (in case XML parsing happens at instantiation time)

##### Technical details

The XmlRepresentation (and inherited DOMRepresentation and SaxRepresentation), JacksonRepresentation classes and subclasses declare two new attributes :

* "expandingEntityRefs": instance attribute which specifies if the parser should expand entity referenced nodes, default value : false (inherited from XML\_EXPANDING\_ENTITY\_REFS),
* "validatingDtd": instance attribute to enforce XML stream validation against a DTD, default value : false (inherited from XML\_VALIDATING\_DTD).

You may override the default value of these attributes if you need Entity Expansion or DTD validation. In these cases, you 'll be subject to XEE vulnerability.

Moreover, the SaxRepresentation and its subclasses declare a third new attribute :

* "secureProcessing": instance attribute which activates the Sax internal secure processing feature (to avoid XML overflow attacks), default value : true (inherited from XML\_SECURE\_PROCESSING).

#### If your code uses Annotated ServerResources

In this case, the Restlet Framework engine calls XML converters, that leverage the Representation classes and subclasses discussed above.

The security fix enlarges the control you have regarding the XML parsing handled at the Representation level.

* XML\_EXPANDING\_ENTITY\_REFS: class attribute that sets the default value for the "expandingEntityRefs" instance attribute. Default value is false (inherited from the "org.restlet.ext.xml.expandingEntityRefs" system property).
* XML\_VALIDATING\_DTD: class attribute that provides the default value for the "validatingDtd" attribute. Default value is false (inherited from the "org.restlet.ext.xml.validatingDtd" system property).
* XML\_SECURE\_PROCESSING class attribute that provides the default value for the "secureProcessing" attribute. Default value is true (overrided by the "org.restlet.ext.xml.secureProcessing" system property).

#### Other XML Parsers

The enhancements described above concern the Jackson and Jaxb parsers.

The Rome extension relies on JDOM. Our XEE internal tests did not reveal XEE vulnerability.

The XStream extension relies on SAX, and is explicitely configured to be XEE safe. Our XEE internal tests confirmed no XEE vulnerability.

Concerning the JiBX and Emf extensions, our XEE internal tests did not reveal XEE vulnerability. Yet, we welcome your feedbacks on these later extensions.

Human progress depends on the open source community. One of the biggest issues facing developers today is how to create and consume open source in a secure and trusted way. And at GitHub, we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to provide the tools, best practices, and infrastructure to make software development secure.

Today we’re announcing a big step in securing the open source supply chain: we’re [welcoming Semmle to GitHub](https://blog.semmle.com/secure-software-github-semmle/).

Semmle’s revolutionary semantic code analysis engine allows developers to write queries that identify code patterns in large codebases and search for vulnerabilities and their variants. Semmle is trusted by security teams at Uber, NASA, Microsoft, Google, and has helped find thousands of vulnerabilities in some of the largest codebases in the world, as well as over 100 CVEs in open source projects to date.

Security researchers use Semmle to quickly find vulnerabilities in code with simple declarative queries. These teams then share their queries with the Semmle community to improve the safety of code in other codebases. Software security is a community effort; no single company can find every vulnerability or secure the open source supply chain behind everyone’s code. Semmle’s community-driven approach to identifying and preventing security vulnerabilities is the very best way forward.

To learn more about our approach to developer security, check out [a detailed overview of secure development on GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-securing-software-together/) from Shanku Niyogi, SVP of Product. The [Semmle blog](https://blog.semmle.com/) has many videos and examples of Semmle in action, and you can check out your favorite open source projects on Semmle’s [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com).

We’re so excited to be joined by the Semmle team and to welcome their world class engineers and security researchers to GitHub. Together, we’ll bring their work to all open source communities and to our customers. As a community of developers, maintainers, and researchers, we can all work together toward more secure software for everyone.
