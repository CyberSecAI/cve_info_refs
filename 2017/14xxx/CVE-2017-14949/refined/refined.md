Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14949:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of external entities in XML parsing within the Restlet Framework. Specifically, setting the `expandingEntityRefs` attribute to `false` was not sufficient to prevent external entity expansion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to prevent the expansion of external entities during XML parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to:
    -  Read local files from the server (if the server has access to them).
    -  Cause a denial-of-service by triggering a "billion laughs" attack (exponential entity expansion).
    -  Potentially perform SSRF attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
-  By sending a specially crafted XML document to the server, which contains external entity declarations, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to the server that is processed by the vulnerable Restlet Framework components. This typically means that the attacker can make HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix was introduced in Restlet Framework version 2.3.12 and later.
- The affected components are `XmlRepresentation`, `DOMRepresentation`, `SaxRepresentation`, and `JacksonRepresentation` classes and their subclasses within the "XML" Restlet Framework extension.
- The fix ensures that incoming XML streams are parsed safely to block external entity expansion.
- The vulnerability was reported by Man Yue Mo of Semmle Inc. (now part of GitHub) and lgtm.com (now deprecated, see content).
- The vulnerability is related to improper handling of the `expandingEntityRefs` attribute. While the attribute was meant to control entity expansion, setting it to false was insufficient to block it completely. The fix hardens the handling of XML streams.
