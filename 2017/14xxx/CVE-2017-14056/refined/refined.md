Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14056:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `rl2_read_header()` function within the `libavformat/rl2.c` file of the FFmpeg library.
*   The root cause is a missing End-of-File (EOF) check within loops that read chunk sizes and offsets. This allows for a crafted RL2 file to specify a large "frame_count" value in its header without providing sufficient actual data, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing EOF check:** The core weakness is the lack of an `avio_feof()` check within the loops that read chunk sizes and offsets. This allows the loops to continue indefinitely if the provided file is shorter than expected, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Uncontrolled resource consumption:** The loops without an EOF check lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption as the program tries to process non-existent data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. A crafted RL2 file can force the vulnerable function to consume excessive CPU and memory resources, potentially crashing the application or rendering it unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted RL2 file:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted RL2 file to an application using the vulnerable FFmpeg library. This file must contain a header claiming a large "frame_count", without having the backing data to support this claim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted RL2 file to an application that uses the vulnerable FFmpeg library. This could involve:
    *   Tricking a user into opening a malicious RL2 file.
    *   Providing the file to a server-side application which processes the file.
    *  Any system that uses libavformat library to parse user supplied RL2 files would be vulnerable.

**Additional details:**

*   The commit `96f24d1bee7fe7bac08e2b7c74db1a046c9dc0de` in the FFmpeg repository addresses this vulnerability by adding `avio_feof()` checks within the affected loops.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Xiaohei and Wangchu from Alibaba Security Team.
*   Debian assigned this CVE in DSA-3996-1.

In summary, CVE-2017-14056 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the `rl2_read_header()` function of FFmpeg due to missing EOF checks, which can be triggered by a malicious RL2 file leading to excessive resource consumption.
