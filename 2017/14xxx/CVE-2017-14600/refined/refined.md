The provided content describes two SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the `pragyan` project.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `getSuggestions` function in `cms/admin.lib.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization of the `$pattern` variable, which is directly incorporated into an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code directly concatenates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by manipulating the injected SQL query using a boolean-based injection.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is located in the `cms/admin.lib.php` file, specifically in the `getSuggestions` function, accessible through the `doaction=getsuggestions` and `forwhat` GET parameters in the admin panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable admin panel.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `delete_blacklist` function in `cms/admin.lib.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection because the input from `$_GET['del_black']` is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. The `safe_html` function, which is used, only performs HTML escaping, which does not prevent SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code uses user-supplied input directly in an SQL query, and the provided `safe_html` function is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can use this to perform error-based SQL injection, potentially gaining the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to data extraction or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is located in the `cms/admin.lib.php` file, specifically in the `delete_blacklist` function, accessible through the `subaction=global` and `del_black` GET parameters in the admin panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable admin panel.
