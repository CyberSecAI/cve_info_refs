- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 Service Agent, which listens on ports 4000 and 4001, crashes when it receives large amounts of random data due to improper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) vulnerability. The service agent does not properly validate the size of incoming packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS). Sending a large packet to the affected ports can cause the service to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a large packet to TCP/4000 or TCP/4001. For port 4000, the crash occurs consistently, while the crash on port 4001 might require multiple attempts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the Moxa EDR-810 device. No authentication is required.
