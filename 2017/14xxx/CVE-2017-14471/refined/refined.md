- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLC firmware allows unauthenticated users to read and write to various files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The PLC does not properly restrict access to data, program, and function files, allowing unauthenticated users to perform read and write operations. Specifically, this CVE concerns the STI, EII, and HSC function files, which contain bits signifying fault occurrences and auto-start configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger faults in the STI, EII, and HSC modules by setting specific bits in their respective function files, causing the device to fault when moved into a run state. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted, unauthenticated CIP encapsulated PCCC commands over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the PLC. No authentication is required. The attacker needs to send specific function codes (0xa7, 0xa9, 0xaa, or 0xab) to trigger the vulnerability.
