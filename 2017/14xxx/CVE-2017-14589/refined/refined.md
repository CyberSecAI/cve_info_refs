Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a double OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) evaluation within FreeMarker templates. This occurs through the use of Struts FreeMarker tags in Atlassian Bamboo.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double OGNL Evaluation:** The core issue is that OGNL expressions within FreeMarker templates are being evaluated twice, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server running the vulnerable Bamboo instance. This can lead to a full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Restricted Administrative Rights:** An attacker with limited administrative access to Bamboo can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Website Hosting:** An attacker could host a malicious website that, if visited by a Bamboo administrator, could trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Injection through specially crafted input**: The specific vector of injection is through FreeMarker templates, which are used to generate dynamic content within the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs either:
    -  Restricted administrative access to Bamboo, or
    - Ability to entice a Bamboo administrator to visit a malicious webpage.
- An understanding of OGNL and FreeMarker templating is beneficial for crafting the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is classified as "critical" severity.
- The vulnerability affects Bamboo versions before 6.1.6 and versions between 6.2.0 and 6.2.5.
-  The issue is tracked as BAM-18842 in Atlassian's Jira.
- The fix involves upgrading to Bamboo 6.1.6 or 6.2.5 or later versions.
-  Atlassian credited Sebastian Perez for reporting this vulnerability.
