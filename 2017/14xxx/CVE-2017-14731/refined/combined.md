Package        : libofx
Version        : 1:0.9.4-2.1+deb7u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-2816 CVE-2017-14731

CVE-2017-2816
     An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tag
     parsing functionality of LibOFX 0.9.11. A specially crafted OFX
     file can cause a write out of bounds resulting in a buffer
     overflow on the stack. An attacker can construct a malicious
     OFX file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2017-14731
     ofx_proc_file in ofx_preproc.cpp allows remote attackers to cause
     a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application
     crash) via a crafted file

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1:0.9.4-2.1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libofx packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Notes: Thanks to Kapsi internet-käyttäjät ry for providing fuzzing resources.

You can create the reproducer with:

```
python3 -c "import binascii;print(binascii.unhexlify('3c4f46583e').decode('ascii'))" > char_traits-heap-buffer-overflow.ofx
