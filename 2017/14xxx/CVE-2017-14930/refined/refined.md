The provided content is related to CVE-2017-14930.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `decode_line_info` function within `dwarf2.c` in GNU binutils version 2.29. Specifically, the linked list `table->sequences` is not properly freed when an error occurs during the processing of DWARF debug information, before it's replaced with a `bfd_alloc` array in `sort_line_sequences`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: Memory allocated by `bfd_malloc` is not freed during the disassemble process under certain error conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: Repeated triggering of this vulnerability could lead to a gradual consumption of memory, potentially causing the application to crash or become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing crafted ELF files containing specific DWARF debug information.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `objdump` is used to disassemble an ELF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable `objdump` utility.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the function `decode_line_info` located in `dwarf2.c`.
- The `table->sequences` is a linked list before it is replaced by `bfd_alloc` array in `sort_line_sequences`. If an error occurs before the replacement, the linked list is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.
- The memory leak is detectable with AddressSanitizer.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) executable (`memory leak poc`) is attached, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix involves properly freeing line sequences on error.
