Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an open redirection issue within the Documentum Administrator application. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-provided URLs, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirection:** The core weakness is the application's susceptibility to open redirection. It allows an attacker to manipulate the URL to redirect users to a different domain controlled by the attacker.
- **Insecure URL Handling:** The application does not sufficiently validate or sanitize the provided `redirectUrl` parameter, which is used for redirection purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can frame malicious content on a trusted domain, potentially stealing user credentials through fake login forms.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to websites hosting malware, leading to infection.
- **Data Theft:** The application appends sensitive user information (username and a base64 encoded encrypted password, referred to as "ticket") to the redirection URL, potentially allowing an attacker to steal these before the redirection occurs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URL Parameters:** Attackers inject malicious URLs into the `startat` or `redirectUrl` parameters.
- **Specific Browser Behavior:** The second instance of the vulnerability exploits a behavior specific to Internet Explorer, where `/%09/` is treated as `//` allowing the redirection to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that can be passed to the vulnerable application, and to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters used for redirection (`startat`, `redirectUrl`, etc).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application to leverage the redirection vulnerability.
- For the second instance, the victim must be using Internet Explorer to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit was tested on Documentum Administrator version 7.2.0180.0055. However, other versions may also be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability also exists in Documentum Webtop, identified by CVE-2017-14525.
- The proof of concept includes two different instances of open redirection.
