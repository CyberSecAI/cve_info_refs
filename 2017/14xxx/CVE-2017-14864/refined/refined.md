Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid memory address dereference in the `Exiv2::getULong` function within `types.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory address dereference leading to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Processing a specially crafted image file using `exiv2`. The crafted file triggers the invalid memory dereference when the `getULong` function is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted image file to the vulnerable application. The application must then process the file, which can be achieved by tricking a user into processing a malicious file with exiv2, or by having the vulnerable application process an attacker-controlled image file.

**Additional details:**
- The bugzilla entry shows the specific code path leading to the crash, highlighting the call stack involving various `Exiv2` functions used in processing image metadata.
- The provided information from Debian also links this CVE with other Exiv2 vulnerabilities, providing a broader view of the various issues that have been addressed in the same update.
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability in their product and points to the fix in their errata RHSA-2019:2101.
