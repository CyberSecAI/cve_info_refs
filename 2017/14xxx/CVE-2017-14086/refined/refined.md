Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-14086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in Trend Micro OfficeScan versions 11.0 and XG (12.0). Specifically, the vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to access and trigger the execution of specific executables (`fcgiOfcDDA.exe` and `cgiRqUpd.exe`) within the OfficeScan application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Remote Process Execution:**  Attackers can remotely trigger the execution of `fcgiOfcDDA.exe` without authentication. This process runs briefly and then crashes, generating a dump file, which can lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **INI File Corruption:** Attackers can send a specially crafted request to `cgiRqUpd.exe` which results in an "INI corruption," further supporting a denial of service attack. This is done by sending the text `[INI_UPDATE_SECTION]` followed by `BOOOM!` within the request.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication requirements to access vulnerable executables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (limited):** While not arbitrary code execution, the ability to remotely start `fcgiOfcDDA.exe` indicates a potential for further exploitation if a suitable method was found to inject code during the execution or use this execution to trigger other vulnerabilities
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated requests to execute `fcgiOfcDDA.exe` can consume server disk space with crash dump files. The INI corruption from `cgiRqUpd.exe` can also cause a denial of service.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The crash of `fcgiOfcDDA.exe` indicates memory corruption due to the way it is invoked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests sent to the vulnerable OfficeScan server application.
    *   Specifically, requesting `/officescan/console/CGI/fcgiOfcDDA.exe` to trigger process execution.
    *   Specifically, requesting `/officescan/CGI/cgiRqUpd.exe` with a crafted request to trigger ini corruption.
*   **Network Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via port 4343.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target OfficeScan server. No authentication is required.
*   **Basic HTTP Skills:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests using tools such as `curl`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `fcgiOfcDDA.exe` process crashes with an exception code `c000000d`, which suggests a memory access violation.
*   The vulnerability was patched by Trend Micro on September 27, 2017.
