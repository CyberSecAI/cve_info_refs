### Summary:
The provided documents describe a vulnerability in the `apport` package, specifically concerning how it handles core dumps of setuid binaries and processes within PID namespaces. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2017-14177. The root cause is an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1324, leading to privilege escalation and denial of service.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability arises from `apport`'s flawed method of identifying tainted/protected processes by comparing the real UID and GID of the crashed process (from `/proc/<pid>/status`) with the UID and GID file owner information of `/proc/<pid>/stat`. If these match, `apport` incorrectly assumes the process is not tainted and writes a core dump as root, which can be exploited if the process is setuid and has dropped privileges after forking.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1324:**  The initial fix only partially addressed the issue of writing core dumps for setuid processes.
- **Incorrect Tainted Process Detection:** `Apport` incorrectly assumes non-tainted status based on a flawed comparison of UIDs/GIDs, allowing core dumps for tainted processes.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Writing core dumps for tainted processes as root allows privilege escalation as the core dump can be exploited by the attacker to gain root privileges
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The ability to force core dumps can lead to resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain root privileges by exploiting a core dump created by `apport` for a setuid program.
- **Denial of Service:** A local attacker can cause resource exhaustion by triggering excessive core dumps, leading to a DoS condition.

### Attack vectors:
- Local attacker running setuid programs
- Local attacker forcing a crash of a process that meets the conditions.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user account on the affected system.
- Ability to execute programs.
- Knowledge of how to cause a crash of a process with specific properties.

### Additional details:
- The vulnerability affects all supported Ubuntu releases, including 12.04 LTS (ESM), 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, 17.04, and 17.10.
- The proper fix is to never write core dump files for processes where `suid_dumpable=2` has taken effect, by checking core(5) output through kernel.core_pattern.
-  The vulnerability is related to how `apport` handles setuid programs and does not properly handle cases where setuid processes drop privileges after forking.
- The vulnerability is identified as part of a larger set of security issues in `apport`, including issues related to container/PID namespace handling (CVE-2017-14179 and CVE-2017-14180), which are addressed in the same fixes.
