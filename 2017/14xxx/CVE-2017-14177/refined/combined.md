# apport 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.27 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
apport (2.14.1-0ubuntu3.27) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE: Denial of service via resource exhaustion and
    privilege escalation when handling crashes of tainted processes
    (LP: [#1726372](/bugs/1726372))
    - When /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable is set to 2, do not assume that
      the user and group owning the /proc/<PID>/stat file is the same
      user and group that started the process. Rather check the dump
      mode of the crashed process and do not write a core file if its
      value is 2. Thanks to Sander Bos for discovering this issue!
    - CVE-2017-14177
  * SECURITY UPDATE: Denial of service via resource exhaustion,
    privilege escalation, and possible container escape when handling
    crashes of processes inside PID namespaces (LP: [#1726372](/bugs/1726372))
    - Change the method for determining if a crash is from a container
      so that there are no false positives from software using PID
      namespaces. Additionally, disable container crash forwarding by
      ignoring crashes that occur in a PID namespace. This functionality
      may be re-enabled in a future update. Thanks to Sander Bos for
      discovering this issue!
    - CVE-2017-14180

## Binary packages built by this source

[apport](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport):
automatically generate crash reports for debugging

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 .

 This package also provides a command line frontend for browsing and

 handling the crash reports. For desktops, you should consider

 installing the GTK+ or Qt user interface (apport-gtk or apport-kde).

[apport-gtk](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport-gtk):
GTK+ frontend for the apport crash report system

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 .

 This package provides a GTK+ frontend for browsing and handling the

 crash reports.

[apport-kde](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport-kde):
KDE frontend for the apport crash report system

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 .

 This package provides a KDE frontend for browsing and handling the

 crash reports.

[apport-noui](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport-noui):
tools for automatically reporting Apport crash reports

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 .

 Installing this package will configure your system to automatically submit

 all new Apport crash reports.

[apport-retrace](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport-retrace):
tools for reprocessing Apport crash reports

apport-retrace recombines an Apport crash report (either a file or a

 Launchpad bug) and debug symbol packages (.ddebs) into fully symbolic

 stack traces. This can optionally use a sandbox for installing debug symbol

 packages and doing the processing, so that entire process of retracing crashes

 can happen with normal user privileges without changing the system.

 .

 You need to install gdb-multiarch if you want to be able to retrace crash

 reports which happened on a different architecture than the one you run

 apport-retrace on.

[apport-valgrind](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/apport-valgrind):
valgrind wrapper that first downloads debug symbols

apport-valgrind is a valgrind wrapper that automatically downloads related

 available debug symbols and provides them to valgrind's memcheck tool, which

 is executed. The output is a valgrind log file ("valgrind.log") that contains

 stack traces (with as many symbols resolved as available) and that shows

 memory leaks.

[dh-apport](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/dh-apport):
debhelper extension for the apport crash report system

apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and

 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump

 helper hook provided by the Ubuntu kernel.

 .

 This package provides a debhelper extension to make it easier for other

 packages to include apport hooks.

[python-apport](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/python-apport):
Python library for Apport crash report handling

This Python package provides high-level functions for creating and

 handling apport crash reports:

 .

  \* Query available and new reports.

  \* Add OS, packaging, and process runtime information to a report.

  \* Various frontend utility functions.

  \* Python hook to generate crash reports when Python scripts fail.

[python-problem-report](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/python-problem-report):
Python library to handle problem reports

This Python library provides an interface for creating, modifying,

 and accessing standardized problem reports for program and kernel

 crashes and packaging bugs.

 .

 These problem reports use standard Debian control format syntax

 (RFC822).

[python3-apport](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/python3-apport):
Python 3 library for Apport crash report handling

This Python package provides high-level functions for creating and

 handling apport crash reports:

 .

  \* Query available and new reports.

  \* Add OS, packaging, and process runtime information to a report.

  \* Various frontend utility functions.

  \* Python hook to generate crash reports when Python scripts fail.

and, likely, other distributions and Ubuntu derivatives using Apport

as well.

Exploitation types are privilege escalation (root exploitation), full

disk DoS, and Linux container escaping.

DESCRIPTION, WITH PROPOSED FIXES / WORKAROUNDS

----------------------------------------------

Issue 1 (CVE-2017-14177): Incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1324

-----------------------------------------

Exploitation types: privilege escalation, full disk DoS.

Ubuntu releases affected: 12.04 LTS (ESM), 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, 17.04, 17.10

(i.e., all currently supported releases).

Note: default OS installations might need an extra package installed,

or a system configuration setting changed, to be exploitable.

Description:

The Apport issue I reported in 2015 (CVE-2015-1324) [2], leading to

privilege escalation, was not fixed properly. The initial issue and

vulnerability still apply, although to a lesser extent.

Since the introduction of the fix [3] Apport detects setuid, unreadable,

and other types of tainted / protected binaries / processes by

comparing the real UID and real GID of the crashed process, read from

/proc/<pid>/status and which Apport first sets its own UID and GID to,

with the UID and GID file owner information of /proc/<pid>/stat.

For non tainted processes, the file owner information of /proc/<pid>/stat

is the UID and GID of the user that started the process. For tainted

processes, the file owner information is 0.

If the comparison does not match, Apport assumes the process to be a

tainted process, and disables writing a core dump file. This on itself

is correct.

However, if the comparison \_does\_ match, it is not always correct to

assume that the process is \_not\_ a tainted process (and, consequently,

write a core dump file). For example, some setuid programs run by users

receive real UID 0 and real GID 0. Also, some setuid processes started

by root (partially) drop privileges at some point (after which users

could crash them), for example after forking, but retain real UID 0 and

real GID 0.

In such cases, Apport writes a core dump file (as root) while in fact

it should not do so. This brings back the problem of CVE-2015-1324.

It should also be noted that, for the same reason, Apport "dropping privileges"

to the real UID and real GID read from /proc/<pid>/status is at times

incorrect and, thus, unsafe as well.

Proposed fix:

The proper fix is to really \_never\_ write a core dump file for processes

where suid\_dumpable=2 got effectuated. This was probably what was

intended with the fix for CVE-2015-1324, but the check that was created

does not catch all cases of tainted processes. A better approach would

be to let Apport read out "%d" from core(5) through "kernel.core\_pattern"

and if it returns "2", not write a core dump file. Note however that

"%d" is only present since kernel version 3.7, and would thus not work

on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS systems running a 3.2 "GA" (General Availability)

kernel from earlier Ubuntu 12.04.x LTS releases (as opposed to such

systems running a 3.13 "HWE" (Hardware Enablement Stack) kernel from

later Ubuntu 12.04.x LTS releases).

Issue 2 (CVE-2017-14179): Apport lacking container / PID namespace support

and

Issue 3 (CVE-2017-14180): Apport broken container / PID namespace support

---------------------------------------------------------

Exploitation types: container escape, privilege escalation, full disk DoS.

Ubuntu releases affected: 12.04 LTS (ESM), 16.04 LTS, 17.04, 17.10.

Note: exploitable on default OS installations.

Description:

Issue 2 (CVE-2017-14179):

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: Apport does not recognize ("support")

PID namespaces / containers.

Issue 3 (CVE-2017-14180):

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 17.04, and Ubuntu 17.10: Apport supports

containers, but checks if a crashed program originated in a container

only by checking for a mismatch of the global PID and the local PID of a

crashed process. This check will in fact be true in case of a process

that originated in a container. However, the check does not suffice

because a second, nested, PID namespace can exist in the container

(without itself being part of another "full" container). In that case

Apport (or, actually, a second Apport called by the host OS Apport,

and running in the container) will incorrectly take information from

the container /proc directory while in fact that /proc does not belong

to the PID namespace from which the crashed process originated.

(Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the other supported Ubuntu release, does detect

containers but not "support" them: it exits in case of a global / local

PID mismatch. Apport's container support was disabled in April 2015

due to security vulnerabilities and re-implemented in February 2016,

but the new container support implementation was not added to

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, probably because it uses sytemd features and

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS does not run systemd. Thus, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is not

vulnerable, although that is more or less by coincedence.)

Apport misreading /proc for PID namespaces processes breaks Apport's

functionality for applications that use "CLONE\_NEWPID" (see the clone(2)

and unshare(2) man pages), because /proc<pid>/ will either belong to

a different (global) process with the same global PID as the local PID

of the crashed proces, or it will not exist in case no global process

with that PID exists. This broken functionality is a bug on itself but,

worse, introduces a security vulnerability.

Simple demonstrational PoC:

To demonstrate the above, the following C program could be run as a

non-root user on for example an Ubuntu 17.10 (LXC) system container

(called "container OS" in the rest of this report) on an Ubuntu 17.04

host OS:

---

#define \_GNU\_SOURCE

#include <sched.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <unistd.h>

#include <sys/resource.h>

#include <sys/time.h>

int main(void) {

   int pid;

   struct rlimit corelimit;

corelimit.rlim\_cur = RLIM\_INFINITY;

   corelimit.rlim\_max = RLIM\_INFINITY;

   setrlimit(RLIMIT\_CORE, &corelimit);

unshare(CLONE\_NEWUSER|CLONE\_NEWPID);

chdir("/tmp/");

pid = fork();

   if (pid == 0) {

      abort();

   }

}

---

Thus, there are three layers: host OS -> container OS -> PID namespace.

The forked process in the program above will have PID 1 within the PID

namespace, i.e., within the third layer.

Running this program (in the container OS) will trigger Apport in the

host OS, which will forward the crash to the Apport of the container OS.

This second Apport instance will then actually handle the crash. It will

use PID 1 for this, since that's the PID that Apport from the host OS

has told it to use: the local PID of the crashed process.

This PID 1 is the local PID 1 from the PID namespace, but Apport from the

container OS reads from /proc/1/ from the container OS. This directory

actually belongs to PID 1 within the container OS, \_not\_ PID 1 from

within the PID namespace.

Effectively, the Apport in the container will create

a ".crash" crash report file in /var/crash/, for example

/var/crash/\_lib\_systemd\_systemd.0.crash or /var/crash/\_sbin\_init.0.crash,

with UID root and GID root as file owner (although Apport may optionally

change the GID of the crash report file later on). Apport will also

create the file "/core", with UID root and GID root as file owner as well.

The files will contain /proc information belonging to (coming from),

and for the crash report file the path name of, the \_global\_ PID 1

within the container OS. Also, the CWD of that global PID 1 is taken

as the directory to write the core dump file in, not the CWD of the

crashed program (which is set to /tmp/ to demonstrate that). The core

dump contents in the crash report file and the contents of the "/core"

core dump file \_are\_ in fact coming from the crashed program, which is

correct, although exactly this can be used for further exploitation.

The above program also works on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, when running as a host

OS (as opposed to running it as a container OS). The effect is similar,

but the cause of the effect is different (it's a different bug / code

issue): Apport in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS does not recognize at all that the

crashed process originated in a PID namespace / container, and it will

not see a global PID \_and\_ a local PID of the process, but only its

local PID 1 which it will then use (which is wrong, as that local PID

1 obviously is not the global PID 1).

For Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with a 3.2 "GA" (General Availability) kernel (from

earlier Ubuntu 12.04.x LTS releases), as opposed to such systems running

a 3.13 "HWE" (Hardware Enablement Stack) kernel (from later Ubuntu

12.04.x LTS releases), it should be noted that exploitation might be

more difficult, and perhaps not possible on default OS installations.

This is because user namespaces ("CLONE\_NEWUSER", see the clone(2)

and unshare(2) man pages) is not available in kernel version 3.2, i.e.,

non-root users can not create PID namespaces ("CLONE\_NEWPID" requires

"CLONE\_NEWUSER"), although for example setuid programs from packages

installed by root could do this for them.

It should also be noted that exploitability of this vulnerability does

not only depend on what release of Ubuntu is running, but also if it is

running as the host OS, as a containers OS, or as both of them.

Below follows a, possibly incomplete but believed to be accurate,

overview of host OS / container OS combinations and what can be achieved

in exploitation in each combination. Full disk DoS scenarios are also

possible on either the host OS, the container OS, or both, but not

included here.

Host OS: 12.04 LTS

Container OS: not involved

Simple exploit: user on host OS creates "/core" on host OS

Privilege escalation exploit: user host OS -> root host OS

Host OS: 12.04 LTS

Container OS: any Linux distribution

Simple exploit: user in container OS creates "/core" on host OS

Privilege escalation exploit: user container OS -> root host OS

\*\*\* Note: effectively this means escaping a container, and is not limited to Ubuntu \*\*\*

Host OS: 16.04 LTS / 17.04 / 17.10

Container OS: 16.04 LTS / 17.04 / 17.10

Simple exploit: user on container OS creates "/core" on container OS

Privilege escalation exploit: user container OS -> root container OS

Note: escaping a container as mentioned in the

user container OS -> root host OS scenario above does not refer to a

general container escape technique using for example a bug in LXC, Linux

namespaces, or the fact that the kernel is shared between the container

and host OS; instead, it refers to a Apport specific, newly found, but

"indirect" method of escaping a container. The end effect is however

equal, thus it is mentioned as a way of escaping a container.

Note: the user container OS -> root container OS scenario could from

that point on lead to privilege escalation to root on the host OS, for

example by exploiting the fact that the container OS and the host OS

share the same kernel. Known, general techniques could be used for that.

This would require the container OS to be running in a "privileged"

container, i.e., a container created by and running as the root user on

the host OS, as opposed to be running in an "unprivileged" container,

i.e., a container created by but not running as root on the host OS,

or created by a non-root user on the host OS. This could for example

be the case when user namespaces are disabled or otherwise not available

on the host OS,

Proposed fix:

For Apport without container support (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS), a fix could be to

have Apport detect containers by comparing the global PID and the local

PID of a crashed process and if they don't match, exit (this is exactly

what is currently done in Ubuntu LTS 14.04). Note however that the "%P"

global PID template specifier from core(5) is only available and can

thus be only used in "kernel.core\_pattern" since kernel version 3.12,

so this fix will be problematic to implement on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS systems

running a 3.2 "GA" (General Availability) kernel (from earlier Ubuntu

12.04.x LTS releases) (as opposed to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS systems running a

3.13 "HWE" (Hardware Enablement Stack) kernel from later Ubuntu 12.04.x

LTS releases).

For Apport with container support (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 17.04, 17.10),

a short term fix (workaround) could be to (again) disable container

support in Apport (this is what is currently done in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).

A long term fix would probably be to have Apport do a proper container

check instead of only relying on PID number information. In any case,

it should be made sure not to read from the wrong /proc directory

(if that can be avoided with certainty at all, e.g., a "container" /

collection of namespaces might not have its own mount namespace or /proc,

in which case things might get difficult).

So I'm only going to cover the container piece and only for 16.04 and later as for everything else we should just do as good a job as we can to turn this off, but unfortunately due to what the kernel would provide in older kernels, I'm not sure that we can always determine that.

So the issue we have here is when a process has 3 PIDs:

 - ns0 pid (host machine)

 - ns1 pid (container where apport runs)

 - ns2 pid (some nested PIDNS which does not have a matching MNTNS + apport instance)

In such case, the kernel tells the host apport process about the ns0 and ns2 pids. Apport rightfully detects that the process is coming from a container, locates the apport socket and sends what it knows of the process across.

Apport in the container will then dump the wrong process as it wasn't provided the pid for the right level of pidns.

This also highlight another general issue with the way apport handles this today. We assume that ns0 pid != ns2 pid means we got a crash from a container. But it would actually be possible to create a clash there too, this may be very tricky to hit, but you could in theory have a process in a pid namespace have the same ns0 and ns2 pid as pids are only unique within their pidns.

Without looking at the code again (traveling), I believe the best way to fix this is to use even more magic kernel features :)

1) Change the container detection code.

   Rather than compare the two pids we should instead be looking for the inode of /proc/<ns0 pid>/ns/pid and compare it /proc/self/ns/pid. If it doesn't match, we're in a different pidns, regardless of what the pid is.

This check should be more reliable in general and wouldn't need to have us use the "new" core\_pattern field.

2) Use a ucred to send the pid to the apport process in the container.

A ucred is a special kernel structure which can be sent over a unix socket and which may contain a pid, uid and gid. This is sent through the out of bound communication mechanism of Linux's unix socket implementation.

ucreds are great for this because any of their field will be translated by the kernel when you read it. So if you set the pid to the host pid, it will be translated to whatever the value is in your pidns. It's also tamper proof. You can only set the pid, uid and gid, to valid values which you own or have privileges over.

The main issue is going to figure out how to send and read ucreds in python.

I've done it many many times in C and Go, but I don't know if python's socket API exposes that kind of low level functionality.

Attaching what should be a fix for the container handling code.

This does two things:

1) It stops assuming that argv[1] != argv[4] means that the crash occurred in a container as this check was getting false positives from host software using pidns (chrome) as well as false negatives from a container process that happens to have the same pid as the host process.

Instead, we're now checking whether we got a separate global pid. If we did, we check whether the crashed process shares mntns and pidns with the apport process (usually hostns). If the crashed process shares either namespace with the host, we consider it as not being a container crash and will process it as a host process crash, replacing the local pid with the global pid before continuing.

This ensures that a crash coming from an application that uses a pidns only will still get handled by apport as normal (pidns would differ, mntns wouldn't).

2) When sending the crash to apport inside the container, we're now doing the following:

   1) Send a ucred as out-of-band data

   2) Send a fd as out-of-band data

   3) Send the arguments as normal data

Apport in the container will then look for the ucred and if found, will override the pid in the arguments string with the pid found in the ucred.

This allows for backward compatibility both ways. A container can run a newer apport and will just move on if the ucred is missing or the host can run a newer apport and the container will still get what it expects.

When both are up to date, the message being sent now will use the ucred's pid field to get kernel level translation of the crashed process' pid. So apport in the container will be getting a pid that makes sense in its namespace as derived from the global pid, rather than using the crashed process' view of the pid.

The attached patch is against Ubuntu 16.04's version of apport and was tested on a 16.04 system.

Thanks Brian. Do you plan on attaching a Trusty debdiff to fix CVE-2017-14177 and CVE-2017-14180 (the incorrect pid comparison to detect in-container crashes)?

My most recent set of patches tried to maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions of apport but that actually won't work. The following change needs to be made.

363 # Simply log an entry in the host error log and exit 0.

364 if len(sys.argv) in (5, 6):

365 host\_pid = int(sys.argv[-1])

366

Should be:

363 # Simply log an entry in the host error log and exit 0.

364 if len(sys.argv) == 6:

365 host\_pid = int(sys.argv[5])

    - When /proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable is set to 2, do not assume that

      the user and group owning the /proc/<PID>/stat file is the same

      user and group that started the process. Rather check the dump

      mode of the crashed process and do not write a core file if its

  \* SECURITY UPDATE: Denial of service via resource exhaustion,

    privilege escalation, and possible container escape when handling

    crashes of processes inside PID namespaces (LP: [#1726372](/bugs/1726372))

    - Change the method for determining if a crash is from a container

      namespaces. Additionally, disable container crash forwarding by

      ignoring crashes that occur in a PID namespace. This functionality

# USN-3480-1: Apport vulnerabilities

15 November 2017

Apport could be tricked into creating files as an administrator, resulting in
denial of service or privilege escalation.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 17.04](/security/notices?release=zesty)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Sander Bos discovered that Apport incorrectly handled core dumps for setuid

binaries. A local attacker could use this issue to perform a denial of service

via resource exhaustion or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2017-14177](/security/CVE-2017-14177))

Sander Bos discovered that Apport incorrectly handled core dumps for processes

in a different PID namespace. A local attacker could use this issue to perform

a denial of service via resource exhaustion or possibly gain root privileges.
