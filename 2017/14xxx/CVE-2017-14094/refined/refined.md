```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `admin_update_program.php` script uses unsanitized user-provided input from the `hidTimingMin` parameter to construct a cron job command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the cron job.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution with the privileges of the `webserv` user, which can be further escalated to root via known privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the `admin_update_program.php` endpoint with a malicious command injected into the `hidTimingMin` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to obtain a valid session ID, which can be achieved via the session hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2017-11398). The attacker can then send the crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint"
