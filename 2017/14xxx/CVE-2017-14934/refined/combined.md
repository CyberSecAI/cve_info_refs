| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22219#c0)  skysider    2017-09-27 07:00:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10490](attachment.cgi?id=10490 "poc of infinite loop") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10490&action=edit "poc of infinite loop") poc of infinite loop  When I run "objdump -x -D -S -s -g -e -G --dwarf -t -T -r -R --special-syms --inlines --dwarf-check loop.elf", it traps into function process_debug_info.  Some of the function snippet is here:  for (section_begin = start, unit = 0; start < end; unit++)     { ......   start += compunit.cu_length + initial_length_size; ...... }  When I debug it with gdb, I can see that compuint.cu_length = 0xfffffff4 and initial_length_size =12 which leads to start +=0 each loop. Maybe there is an integer overflow here. The poc is attached here. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22219#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2017-09-27 09:44:11 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=19485196044b2521af979f1e5c4a89bfb90fba0b>  commit 19485196044b2521af979f1e5c4a89bfb90fba0b Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Wed Sep 27 10:42:51 2017 +0100      Prevent an infinite loop in the DWARF parsing code when encountering a CU structure with a small negative size.

I have checked in a patch to test for negative lengths in the comp_unit structure, which will prevent this infinite loop from happening again.  Cheers   Nick ``` |  |
