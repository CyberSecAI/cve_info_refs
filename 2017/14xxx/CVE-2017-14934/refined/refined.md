- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow occurs within the `process_debug_info` function in `dwarf.c` of binutils. The `cu_length` field within a DWARF compilation unit structure can have a small negative value. When this negative length is added to `start`, it leads to a situation where `start` does not increment, causing the loop to become infinite.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to an infinite loop. The code doesn't properly validate the `cu_length` field before incrementing the start pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The infinite loop causes the `objdump` utility to hang and potentially become unresponsive, consuming CPU resources and preventing further processing.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted ELF file with a DWARF compilation unit structure containing a negative `cu_length` value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious ELF file to be processed by the vulnerable `objdump` command.
