- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLCs. Specifically, the PLC allows unauthenticated read access to a specific undocumented data file containing the master password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication and authorization for accessing sensitive data files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read the master password of the PLC which can then be used to perform further attacks on the PLC such as modifying ladder logic and causing device faults.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted CIP encapsulated PCCC commands over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the PLC. No prior authentication is needed.
