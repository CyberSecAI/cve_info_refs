Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-14990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `wp_signups.activation_key` field in the WordPress database stores user activation keys in plain text instead of a hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of activation keys in a non-hashed, plaintext format in the database. This exposes the keys if an attacker gains access to the database.
- **Lack of Expiration:** Initially, the activation keys did not have an expiration mechanism, meaning they could be used indefinitely if compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker gains access to the database, they can obtain the plaintext activation keys.
- With a valid activation key, an attacker can complete the user registration process, gaining access to the site as a new user.
- Once logged in, the attacker can potentially upload files, delete content, and perform other actions depending on the user role they acquire.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Breach:** The primary attack vector is gaining unauthorized access to the WordPress database. This could occur through various means, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities, compromised server credentials, or other methods of data breach.
- **Email Compromise (Indirect):** While not the direct vector, an attacker gaining access to a user's email could potentially obtain activation links containing the plaintext key. However, the lack of key expiration was a more immediate concern in this case, as even old, unactivated keys remained valid until used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker needs the ability to query the database where WordPress stores the `wp_signups` table. This implies some level of administrative or compromised access to the underlying server.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send a GET request to `wp-activate.php` with the compromised activation key.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

- The provided content details the development of a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The patch involved hashing the activation keys with a timestamp to include an expiration mechanism, similar to how user activation keys are handled (`wp_users.user_activation_key`).
- The patch was designed to handle both old (plain text) and new (hashed) activation keys so as not to invalidate existing pending activations.
- It also introduced a time-based expiration for activation keys to limit the time window for potential attacks.
- The content mentions that while the security risk is not critical (as database access would allow greater compromise), the ability to use an activation key to create a new account presents a significant risk that needed to be resolved.
