# wp\_signups.activation\_key stores activation keys in plain text

### Description

## Steps

1. Visit /wp-admin/user-new.php (on a multisite installation - I haven't tested on single site)
2. Fill out the "Add New User" form but do not check the "Skip Confirmation Email" checkbox
3. The user will be sent an email containing a link to /wp-activate.php?key=7259c714857ef009

## Actual behaviour

This key is stored in the database unencrypted:

```
mysql> select activation_key from wp_signups where signup_id=4;
+------------------+
| activation_key   |
+------------------+
| 7259c714857ef009 |
+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```
## Expected behaviour

wp\_users.user\_activation\_key contains a timestamp and a hash of the key. wp\_signups.activation\_key is no less important to security and so should include these security features too.

Hi,

The current proposed patch (38474.patch) will implement this feature, with additionally providing signup\_id to be able to retrieve records from the database.

Example workflow (given a multi-side WordPress setup):

1. Visit /wp-admin/user-new.php
2. Fill out the "Add New User" form but do not check the "Skip Confirmation Email" checkbox
3. The user will be sent an email containing a link to /wp-activate.php?key=<KEY>&signup\_id=<SIGNUP\_ID> [![](/raw-attachment/ticket/38474/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-15%20at%2002.04.56%20AM.png)](/attachment/ticket/38474/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-15%20at%2002.04.56%20AM.png)
4. Check the records in the database
   ```
   mysql> select * from wp_signups;
   +-----------+--------+------+-------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | signup_id | domain | path | title | user_login | user_email           | registered          | activated           | active | activation_key                     | meta                                                               |
   +-----------+--------+------+-------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         1 |        |      |       | testa      | ..........@......com | 2017-01-15 01:04:44 | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |      0 | $P$BOEBNJ7xvVIc6JfWQuFzip208ua.5b0 | a:2:{s:11:"add_to_blog";s:1:"1";s:8:"new_role";s:10:"subscriber";} |
   +-----------+--------+------+-------+------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)

   ```
5. When the user clicks the link, they should be able to login (there is a check for both signup\_id and activation\_key in the backend) [![](/raw-attachment/ticket/38474/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-15%20at%2002.06.48%20AM.png)](/attachment/ticket/38474/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-15%20at%2002.06.48%20AM.png)

@SergeyBiryukov could you please review/provide your input on this?

Probably not that big of a security issue, as someone that has access to the db has access to all of the content more or less. However, if they use an activation key they can login and upload files, delete files, etc.

The early tags are used to milestone events needing to occur early in a cycle. WordPress 4.9 has reached Beta already, so this will not be making the 4.9 release.

Aside from that, it doesn't appear anyone's yet answered how this patch affects users who have already been issued an email to activate an account, then the upgrade to this patch occurs, what happens to those links? Do they continue working?

Thanks for opening a ticket, @tomdxw.

In the future, if you believe you are reporting a security vulnerability, please follow the guidelines at [​https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/). With the text entered in the original issue, there should have also been a required check-box input confirming that a security vulnerability was not being reported.

That said, this is an area that could use some hardening and is okay to be fixed as a public ticket. I don't believe a CVE is necessary. See [#24783](/ticket/24783 "#24783: task (blessed): user_activation_key is not hashed in the database (closed: fixed)") as an example of a related issue that has been addressed publicly in the past. Ideally we'll be able to use a similar fix to help communicate the activation key change to any pending users.

@bor0 - Thank you for the initial patch. I think you're on the right path. It'd be good if we can resolve this without the addition of another parameter on the URL (`signup_id`). See [[25696]](/changeset/25696 "Hash password reset keys in the database.

All existing, unused ...") for an example of how we've handled an old format and new format at the same time. Using the plain text key in the activation URL is okay because we can compare it with an old or new (hashed) version in the DB. I'm going to assign ownership of the ticket to you and will happily review ongoing patches. :)

I'm going to put this in the 5.0 milestone for now, though we may be able to ship it as part of a 4.9.1 release with the right progress.

@jeremyfelt thanks for the example changeset! That approach looks good to me. I will rework the patch.

Hey @jeremyfelt!

Looking at the previous patch I just recalled why I introduced `signup_id` to the GET parameter.

It's so that we don't need to get all the rows from `$wpdb->signups`, and call `CheckPassword` on each one of them to see if it matches. We can get rid of `signup_id` but it's probably faster to do it this way?

In [#24783](/ticket/24783 "#24783: task (blessed): user_activation_key is not hashed in the database (closed: fixed)") they use the same approach, but use `user_login` instead of `signup_id`. However, we don't have `user_login` in this context.

In any case I updated the patch to throw a `WP_Error` in the case of `$key === $signup->activation_key` for legacy data, and also did some code style fixes and updated the filters to contain the hashed key as well.

Let me know how that looks and we can go from there.

Thanks!

I might be missing something, but `wpmu_activate_signup()` only gets one row (`WHERE activation_key = %s`), why would it get all the rows from `$wpdb->signups`? I still don't see the need for `signup_id` there.

On a related note, the patch adds a `Signup ID` input to the activation form. Where the user is supposed to get that value?

### [#14](#comment:14) in reply to: [↑ 12](#comment:12) [@tomdxw](https://profiles.wordpress.org/tomdxw) [7 years](/timeline?from=2017-10-12T12%3A50%3A16Z&precision=second "See timeline at 10/12/2017 12:50:16 PM") ago

@bor0:

The wp\_users.user\_activation\_key field includes a timestamp, and by default the activation link expires after 24 hours. This means that if somebody receives an activation email but they forget about it, and then an attacker gains access to their email days or weeks later, the attacker doesn't have instant access to the site.

[​https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/2ad86e1e82722d8cdae17ff10e34672c8e6ab93a/wp-includes/user.php#L2195-L2196](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/2ad86e1e82722d8cdae17ff10e34672c8e6ab93a/wp-includes/user.php#L2195-L2196)

I think it would be appropriate to use a timestamp here also.

This is done so that we catch any legacy activation keys (see check where `$key === $signup->activation_key`).

I like this approach. Thanks! I will be updating the patch.

# WordPress Slack

[![WordPress and Slack logos](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/files/2019/12/4124.chat-banner.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/files/2019/12/4124.chat-banner.png)

**The WordPress project uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) as its main real-time communication platform**, replacing previous communication platforms such as IRC. When compiling a list of things people liked about our previous communication methods, it was obvious that SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform <https://slack.com/>. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at <https://make.wordpress.org/chat/>. was all of that and more, including:

* Open for everyone
* Friendly user interface
* Easy asynchronous conversation
* iOSiOS The operating system used on iPhones and iPads. and Android apps
* Powerful customization abilities
* Excellent search

WordPress historically used IRC for its real-time communication, and is still [where the real-time `#wordpress` support channel exists](https://make.wordpress.org/support/irc-support-channel/). Slack communication is used for *contributing* to the WordPress project, be it code, design, documentation, etc.

[Set up a WordPress.org and Slack account for the Make WordPress Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjO7sGhNJ9o)

## I need help with WordPress!

Please note that there is **no support channel for WordPress on Slack**. The best place to get support is the [WordPress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/) which are highly active and well maintained.

## Joining the WordPress team on Slack

Please [log in to WordPress.org first](https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fmake.wordpress.org%2Fchat%2F&locale=en_US) to join.

## I need help with Slack!

For starters, [Slack’s Help Center](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) is really great. Once you’ve joined [wordpress.slack.com](https://wordpress.slack.com/), there is a #slackhelp channel to help members of the community.

---

Here are some tips for getting the most out of Slack:

### Notifications

The default [notification settings](https://wordpress.slack.com/account/notifications) for Slack send you *everything*. You’re going to want to switch to the recommended settings, which are for mentions and direct messages. You can also tweak these settings further, like setting specific “highlight” words and email preferences.

### Native Desktop and Mobile Apps

Slack has a great, fully-featured [web app](https://wordpress.slack.com/), native [Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?ls=1&mt=12) and [Windows](https://wordpress.slack.com/ssb/download-win) apps, and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-app/id618783545?ls=1&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack) apps. Preferences, conversations, and what you’ve read are synced across devices. Push notifications on the go are pretty cool, too.

![](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/files/2019/12/4124.chat-mobile.png)
### Hiding Join Messages

If the join/leave messages feel somewhat noisy, you may find the [following user style helpful](https://userstyles.org/styles/106647/wordpress-slack-hide-join-leave); it will hide them for you.

### Gravatars

You can (and should!) add your special `@chat.wordpress.org` email to [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/).

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Slack has many useful keyboard shortcuts. Access a list by typing `Cmd-?`. For example, `Shift-Opt-↑` (up or down arrow) to switch to the next unread channel. `Cmd-K` or `Cmd-T` is a “quick switcher” that allows you to jump to any channel quickly. [More keyboard shortcuts](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201374536-Keyboard-Shortcuts).

### Commands

Much like IRC you can use Slack commands in the format `/command` where you start with a forward slash and then type the given command to perform an action. For example, `/away` to toggle status, /me to describe something you’re doing, or `/prefs` to open Preferences menu. [More commands](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201259356-Slash-Commands).

### TracTrac Trac is the place where contributors create issues for bugs or feature requests much like GitHub.<https://core.trac.wordpress.org/>. Integration

Slack has dozens of powerful integrations with other services. We’ve already added a number of them, along with some custom tools using Slack’s webhooks. Trac and SVNSVN Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name svn) is a software versioning and revision control system. Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS). WordPress core and the wordpress.org released code are all centrally managed through SVN. https://subversion.apache.org/. bots served the project well in IRC for years. We’ve brought this functionality to Slack, and looks better, too.

When you enter `#12345`, a bot helpfully prints that ticket’s URLURL A specific web address of a website or web page on the Internet, such as a website’s URL www.wordpress.org and info. You can specify a specific Trac using `#12345-core` or `#123-meta`; otherwise, it is guided by the channel you are in.

If you want to suggest an integration or tool for a channel, or report a bug or issue, join [#slackhelp](https://app.slack.com/client/T024MFP4J/C02QHM0P8).

### WordPress Color Themes

![](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/files/2014/10/apps2.png)

Just enter `#23282d,#191E23,#0073AA,#FFFFFF,#191E23,#FFFFFF,#46B450,#00A0D2` into Preferences → SidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content. It is not always a vertical column on the side. It can be a horizontal rectangle below or above the content area, footer, header, or any where in the theme. Theme. For a theme that mimics the excellent “Midnight” WordPress admin color scheme, try `#363B3F, #26292C, #E14D43, #FFFFFF, #26292C, #FFFFFF, #E14D43, #E14D43`.

in version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u15.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.2+dfsg-2.
