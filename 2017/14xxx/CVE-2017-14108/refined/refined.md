## CVE-2017-14108

The provided content relates to CVE-2017-14108.

**Vulnerability Description:** libgedit.a in GNOME gedit through 3.22.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a file that begins with many '\0' characters.

**Root Cause:** Mishandling of NUL blocks in libgedit.a. Specifically, when gedit opens a file that begins with numerous null characters ('\0'), it leads to excessive CPU consumption.

**Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). Gedit doesn't properly handle files containing many leading null characters, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause gedit to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially rendering the application unusable.

**Attack Vector:** A remote attacker provides a specially crafted file to gedit. The file must begin with a large number of null characters.

**Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a file to gedit, either by tricking a user into opening it or by other means (unspecified in provided texts). No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** GNOME gedit through version 3.22.1.
*   The exploit author tested the vulnerability on Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux 4.4.0-93-generic).
*   The `cxsecurity.com` entry provides a sample command to create a file (`craft.txt`) containing null characters.
*   The `cxsecurity.com` entry includes `pidstat` and `top` output demonstrating high CPU usage by gedit when processing the crafted file.
