Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-14687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from mishandling of XML tag name comparisons within the MuPDF software when processing .xps files. Specifically, the software incorrectly handles non-tag data in tag name comparisons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is that MuPDF doesn't properly validate or sanitize input when parsing XML tag names, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering non-tag data where tags are expected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted .xps file can cause a crash in MuPDF.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The bug has the potential for arbitrary code execution, although this impact is noted as "possibly" and not confirmed by all sources. The Debian security advisory also notes this potential, while the bug report indicates the faulting address controls branch selection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted .xps file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .xps file to the vulnerable MuPDF software. This could be via a user opening a malicious file, or through an automated process if MuPDF is processing untrusted files.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The bug report details the crash occurring on Windows.
*  The fix involves using `fz_xml_is_tag` function instead of the previous idiom `fz_xml_tag && !strcmp` to handle the tag comparisons, indicating that the `!strcmp` was not robust enough to handle all input possibilities, and especially non-tag inputs.
*  The vulnerability was reported by WangLin.
*  The vulnerability affects MuPDF versions prior to the patched versions provided in the advisories.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4006-1 addresses CVE-2017-14687 along with other vulnerabilities.
*   Debian LTS advisory DLA-1164-1 addresses CVE-2017-14687 for the Wheezy release.
