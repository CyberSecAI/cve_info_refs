  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-14537",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the 'lang' parameter in `/maint/modules/home/index.php` and the `xajaxargs` array parameter in `/maint/index.php?packages`. This allows attackers to inject path traversal sequences.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Path Traversal"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote attackers can use directory traversal sequences to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially including sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and critical system files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to /maint/modules/home/index.php with a crafted 'lang' parameter",
         "HTTP POST request to /maint/index.php?packages with a crafted 'xajaxargs' parameter"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Trixbox instance. Authentication is required as specified by the 'Authorization' header with the credentials for user 'maint'. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with 'maint' privileges."
