Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter in SQL queries within the WordPress plugin "Responsive Image Gallery" version 1.1.8. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries through the vulnerable parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Public defacement:** Attackers could modify the website's content.
*   **Confidential data leakage:** Attackers could steal sensitive information from the database.
*   **Database server compromise:**  Attackers could gain control of the database server, potentially affecting other applications hosted on the same server.
*   **Client system compromise:**  Attackers might be able to target client systems as a secondary effect of exploiting the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this with requests to `/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpdevart_gallery_themes&task=add_edit_theme&id=...`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to target a website using the vulnerable version of the "Responsive Image Gallery" plugin.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable URLs. In this case the `id` parameter in the URL needs to be manipulated.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected WordPress installation.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the following files:
    *   `/gallery-album/includes/frontend/gallery_class.php`
    *   `/gallery-album/includes/admin/gallery_theme.php`
*   The vulnerable SQL queries use the `$wpdb->get_row()` function, which directly uses the unsanitized `$theme_id` and `$id` parameters.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using both Union-based and Blind SQL injection techniques.
*   The vulnerability requires using HTTP version 1.0 to interact with the application.
