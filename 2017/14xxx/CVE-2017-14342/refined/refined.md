{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory exhaustion vulnerability was found in the `ReadWPGImage` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is triggered due to incorrect handling of malformed image files, leading to excessive memory allocation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious WPG image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, leads to memory exhaustion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted WPG image file. The attacker would need to trick a user or system into processing this malformed image with ImageMagick.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed WPG image file to a user or system that is using ImageMagick."
