- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses a function that accepts user input without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial-of-service condition, and the ability to modify data.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through a network attack, targeting a function that takes unvalidated user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required, and exploitation requires a low level of skill.
