- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element. The application loads DLL files from a search path, and an attacker can place a malicious DLL file in this path. If the malicious DLL is loaded before the legitimate one, arbitrary code can be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** By placing a specially crafted DLL file in the search path, an attacker can force the application to load and execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to a location included in the application's DLL search path. The attack is remotely exploitable and requires a low skill level to exploit. User interaction is required, as the application needs to be executed and load the malicious DLL.
