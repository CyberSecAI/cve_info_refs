Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-14593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of several argument and command injection vulnerabilities in how Sourcetree for Windows handles Mercurial and Git repositories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Argument Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to argument injection flaws. This implies that an attacker can insert malicious commands or arguments into parameters that are passed to shell commands by Sourcetree.
*   **Command Injection:** The application is also vulnerable to command injection. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by injecting malicious commands into shell operations performed by Sourcetree.
*   **URI Handler Vulnerability:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through a malicious webpage using the Sourcetree URI handler, starting from version 0.8.4b of Sourcetree for Windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution on the system running the vulnerable version of Sourcetree for Windows.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository:** An attacker with permission to commit to a repository linked in Sourcetree can inject malicious commands.
*   **Webpage Exploitation:** A malicious webpage can exploit the Sourcetree URI handler to trigger the vulnerability, if the user opens a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have commit access to a repository that is linked to the victim's Sourcetree application.
*   Alternatively, an attacker can induce the victim to open a malicious link using the Sourcetree URI handler.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Sourcetree for Windows versions 0.5.1.0 up to (but not including) 2.4.7.0 are vulnerable.

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Sourcetree for Windows version 2.4.7.0 and higher.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability has a severity rating of "critical" according to Atlassian's severity scale.
*   The issue is tracked in Atlassian's Jira instance as SRCTREEWIN-8256.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Zhang Tianqi @ Tophant.
*   The vulnerability is related to other issues in Sourcetree for macOS (CVE-2017-14592) and other vulnerabilities involving Mercurial and Git LFS within the application (CVE-2017-17458, CVE-2017-17831).
