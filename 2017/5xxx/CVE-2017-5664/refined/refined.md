RELATED: CVE-2017-5664

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in how Tomcat's DefaultServlet handles error pages when "Sendfile" is used. It was discovered that static error pages used the original request's HTTP method instead of systematically using the GET method which can cause a security bypass.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Incorrect handling of pipelined requests when send file was used, Security constrained bypass in error page mechanism.

Impact of exploitation:
A crafted HTTP request could cause undesirable side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page.

Attack vectors:
Crafted HTTP request.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Remote network access.
