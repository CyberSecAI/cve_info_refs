Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-5552:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in QEMU's Virtio GPU Device emulator while processing the `VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The emulator does not properly handle memory allocation, leading to a leak when the specified command is processed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A guest user or process can exploit the memory leak to consume host memory, eventually leading to a denial of service on the host system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Guest user/process: The vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious guest user or process running within the QEMU virtual machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a QEMU guest operating system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the `VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING` command.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in QEMU when built with Virtio GPU Device emulator support.
- The issue was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.
