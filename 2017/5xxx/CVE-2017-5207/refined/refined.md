Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-5207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firejail handles the `--bandwidth` and `--shell` options. When these options are combined, Firejail executes a user-specified shell with a bandwidth command. This occurs because Firejail uses `execvp` with a user-controlled shell path, and doesn't validate the shell provided via the `--shell` option, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious program path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure use of `execvp`:** Firejail uses `execvp` with a user-controlled path (provided by `--shell`), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of input validation:** Firejail does not validate the provided path for the `--shell` option.
*   **Incorrect privilege handling:** The code temporarily elevates privileges using `setregid(0,0)` before executing the user-supplied command. This was meant to execute the `tc` command but a malicious user can use a crafted shell script instead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can escalate their privileges to root by using a specially crafted shell script, as the vulnerable code is executed as root.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command-line arguments:** The attacker can use the `--shell` and `--bandwidth` command-line arguments with a malicious payload.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system.
*   **Ability to execute Firejail:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `firejail` command.
*   **Ability to create/modify files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious shell script on disk, to use with the `--shell` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Martin Carpenter.
*   The fix involved hardcoding the shell path to `/bin/sh` instead of using the user-supplied shell path when using the bandwidth option.
*   The vulnerability was present in Firejail versions prior to 0.9.44.4 and the fix was released in version 0.9.44.4
