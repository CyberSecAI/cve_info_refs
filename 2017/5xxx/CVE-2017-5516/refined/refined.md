Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically through the `$_GET` parameters, in various PHP files within the GeniXCMS administration panel (`gxadmin`). The application directly embeds these parameters into HTML attributes without proper sanitization or encoding, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of reflected XSS are present. The application takes values from the `$_GET` array, such as 'token', 'act', and 'id', and directly places them within HTML attributes within form tags and input fields without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page by crafting specific URLs.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations:**
    *   `./gxadmin/inc/pages_form.php`: Line 68 includes `$_GET['token']` directly in a form action.
    *   `./gxadmin/inc/posts_form.php`: Line 55 includes `$_GET['token']` directly in a form action, Line 25 and 55.
    *   `./gxadmin/inc/menus_form.php`: Line 79 includes `$menuid`, which can come from `$_GET['id']`, directly in an input field.
    *   `./gxadmin/inc/menus_form_edit.php`: Line 225 includes `$token` derived from `$_GET['token']`, and Line 104 uses `$menuid` from `$_GET['id']`.
    *   `./gxadmin/inc/user_form.php`: Line 93 includes `$_GET['token']` directly in an input field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when the crafted URL is visited.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Phishing:**  The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or display a fake login page to steal credentials.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the webpage visible to the victim.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, an XSS vulnerability in an admin panel can lead to privilege escalation, depending on the specific application's permissions and other potential vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector is through carefully crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable `$_GET` parameters.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could distribute malicious URLs via phishing emails, social media, or other channels, tricking victims into clicking on them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs that include malicious payloads in the query parameters.
*   **Ability to Distribute Malicious Links:** The attacker needs a way to make the victim click on the crafted URLs, which is often done through social engineering.
*   **No Authentication Required for Exploitation (based on the provided code):** The vulnerabilities are directly accessible through the URLs, meaning no prior authentication or special privileges are needed to trigger them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an example of how a malicious `token` parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code: `http://localhost/GeniXCMS/gxadmin/index.php?page=pages&act=add&token=%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(1)%3E`
*   The vulnerability was reported in January 2017
* The issue also has the 'fixed locally' label indicating that a fix for these issues has been implemented in a local environment.

In summary, the provided content describes multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities due to the improper handling of `$_GET` parameters within the GeniXCMS administration panel. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who visit maliciously crafted URLs, which could result in a variety of impacts, including session hijacking, phishing, and website defacement.
