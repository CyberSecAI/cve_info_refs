{
  "CVE-2017-5188": {
    "Root cause": "The bs_worker code in open build service followed relative symlinks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The bs_worker code did not validate symlinks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Reading of files outside of the package source directory during build, allowing leakage of private information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation is done by including relative symlinks in package source code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to submit package source code to the build service. No specific privileges are required."
  }
