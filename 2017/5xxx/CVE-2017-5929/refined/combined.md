=== Content from logback.qos.ch_b6def966_20250125_122458.html ===


In Logback 1.3.x, few **optional**
components depend on Java EE whereas in logback versions
1.4.x/1.5.x these optional components depend on Jakarta EE. The
1.5.x series continues the 1.4.x series but with logback-access
relocated to its own repository.

## Logback News

You can receive logback-related announcements by subscribing to
the [QOS.ch
announce](http://www.qos.ch/mailman/listinfo/announce) mailing list.

## On the 1.5.x series

The 1.5.x series is a direct descendant of and a drop-in
replacement for the 1.4.x series. It contains few optional
components such as `SMTPAppender` and
`LogbackServletContextListener` which depend on Jakarta
EE (jakarta.\* namespace). The 1.5.x series differs from the 1.4.x
series by the relocation of the *logback-access* module
which was moved to its [own separate
github repository](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access).

Here is a summary of 1.5.x dependencies:

| Logback version | github branch | SLF4J version | JDK at runtime | JDK during build | Enterprise Edition (optional components) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.5.x | master | 2.0.x | 11 | 21 | Jakarta EE (jakarta.\* namespace) |

## On the 1.3.x and 1.4.x series

Few **optional** components such `SMTPAppender`
and `LogbackServletContextListener` depend on Java EE
in logback version 1.3.x whereas in logback 1.4.x/1.5.x these
components depend on Jakarta EE. Here is a summary of the
differences:

| Logback version | github branch | SLF4J version | JDK | Enterprise Edition (optional components) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3.x | branch\_1.3.x | 2.0.x | 8 | Java EE (javax.\* namespace) |
| 1.4.x | branch\_1.4.x | 2.0.x | 11 | Jakarta EE (jakarta.\* namespace) |

Logback components written for logback 1.2 should work without
change in version 1.3. However, Joran, logback's configuration
system, has been rewritten to use an internal representation model
which can be processed separately. Thus, code depending on Joran
needs to be adapted to changes in Joran (logback's internal
configuration mechanism).

As a result of enhancements to Joran, logback configuration
scripts are now largely order-free. For example, appenders can now
be defined after they are first referenced in a logger. Moreover,
unreferenced appenders are no longer instantiated.

## On the 1.2.x series (UNMAINTAINED)

The 1.2.x series has been deprecated for several years and is
no longer maintained. As such, use of the 1.2.x series is
discouraged.

For those using Spring-boot 2.7 or earlier, it is possible to
upgrade to a more recent version of logback by setting the
`org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem` system
property to `none`.

## Reproducible builds

[![](images/reproducible.svg)](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/)

Starting early 2022, logback artifacts for versions
1.3.x and later are binary reproducible, as [independently attested](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/tree/master/content/ch/qos/logback)  by reproducible-central.

---

### 2025-01-07 Release of logback-access version 2.0.6

• Added [`StubEventEvaluator`](../xref-access/ch/qos/logback/access/common/boolex/StubEventEvaluator.html)
as a default nested component rule for `<evaluator>`. Without
this rule, configuration files previously defaulting to
`JaninoEventEvaluator` would raise exceptions.

• Added [`RequestURIEventEvaluator`](../xref-access/ch/qos/logback/access/common/boolex/RequestURIEventEvaluator.html)
and [`StatusCodeEventEvaluator`](../xref-access/ch/qos/logback/access/common/boolex/StatusCodeEventEvaluator.html)
as sample evaluators.

• Bumped logback-core dependency to version 1.5.16.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by building
from [source
code](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access) at commit d580d904bec59338ee5fe57985e6ba62418f982c
associated with the tag `v_2.0.6`. Release built using
Java "21" 2023-10-17 LTS build 21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux
Debian 11.6.

---

### 2025-01-05 Release of logback version 1.5.16

• In order to ease the migration of configuration files depending
on `JaninoEventEvaluator`, logback-classic will emit a
warning about the removal of `JaninoEventEvaluator` in
version 1.5.13 and suggest an [online
migration tool](https://logback.qos.ch/translator/services/janinoExpressionMigrator.html).

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by building from [source code](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback) at commit
74c9ebd0e784d9e9ffc6c627cf5016d0157956b2 associated with the tag
v\_1.5.16. Release built using Java "21" 2023-10-17 LTS build
21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux Debian 11.6.

---

### 2024-12-19 Release of logback-access version 2.0.5

• Fixed non-optional dependencies in
logback-access-Tomcat. This problem was raised in [issues/17](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access/issues/17)
by Jonatan Ivanov.

• Bumped logback-core dependency to version 1.5.14 and

### 2024-12-19 Release of logback version 1.5.14

• Fixed compatibility issue with downstream users who
access the pattern rule registry through the logging context, most
notably Spring-Boot. This issue was reported in [issues/885](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/885)
by StÃ©phane Nicoll.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be

21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux Debian 11.6.

---

### 2024-12-18 Release of logback version 1.5.13

• `PatternLayout` now internally uses a mapping
of conversion words to converter instance suppliers intead of
conversion words to converter class names. This change was
suggested
in [issues/803](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/803)
by Eric Norman. The old map in `PatternLayout` is
deprecated but still exists to preserve backward
compatibility.

• `ConsoleAppender` now prints a status statement
warning the user about the high cost of logging on the console.

• Logback delegates certain asynchronous tasks to a
`ThreadPoolExecutor`. This executor now uses
`LinkedBlockingQueue` instead of
`SynchronousQueue`. This has the effect of queueing
jobs immediately regardless of their number and have them run by
CORE\_POOL\_SIZE (currently 4) concurrent threads. This new strategy
is appropriate as long as jobs to arrive at a slower pace compared
to their duration. If they arrive faster than they can be
completed, the queue size will increase indefinitely but will be
accepted. In the previous strategy, if more than CORE\_POOL\_SIZE (2
previously) arrived, new jobs would be refused.

• `JaninoEventEvaluator` was removed in order
to prevent arbitrary code execution (ACE) attacks made possible by
malicious configuration files. Successful attacks require
significant amount of existing privilege, sign of an already
compromised system. This change is intended to prevent an
escalation of an existing flaw to a higher threat level. This
issue was discovered by 7asecurity and reported under the
reference [CVE-2024-12798](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-12798).

• To prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks,
`SaxEventRecorder` was modified to ignore external DTD
files specified in DOCTYPE declarations in configuration files
written in XML. This issue was discovered by 7asecurity and reported
under the reference [CVE-2024-12801](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-12801).

---

### 2024-10-25 Release of logback version 1.5.12

• `RollingFileAppender` now takes into account
the size of any previously existing log file being written
to. This issue was raised in [issues/867](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/867).

• In the very unusual case where the logger invocation
ended with two exceptions, the penultimate exception was not
treated as a parameter but an exception. This issue was reported
in [issues/876](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/876)
by Michael Rasmussen who also provided the relevant test case.

### 2024-10-08 Release of logback-access version 2.0.4

• Given that logback-access artifacts are often imported
manually into the servlet container's lib/ directory,
logback-access artifact names such as *common-2.0.x.jar* or
*tomcat-2.0.x.jar* can be very confusing. To alleviate this
issue, all logback-access artifacts are now prefixed with the
string "logback-access-". This issue was reported in [logback-access/issues/21](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access/issues/21)

### 2024-10-08 Release of logback version 1.5.9

• Fixed issue in version 1.5.7 causing inccorrect header
output by `RollingFileAppender` as reported in [issues/857](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/857)
reported by Carl Mai who also provided the relevant patch.

• [`PropertiesConfigurator`](manual/configuration.html#propertiesConfigurator)
now supports reading files and watching changes in configuration
files in properties format. The contents can be located in a file
or via a URL using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

• Fixed issue with `PropertiesConfigurator`
thrashing logger names of same length.

• Fixed issue with `PropertiesConfigurator`
incorrectly handling level strings INHERITED and NULL.

---

### 2024-09-06 Release of logback version 1.5.8

• [`SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy`](manual/appenders.html#SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy)
now uses an internal size counter instead of occasionally calling
the OS to obtain file size. The new approach is more precise and
with less jitter.

• In relation to the aforementioned change,
`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` class was renamed as
`SizeAndTimeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy`. Thus,
earlier configuration files using
`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` will no longer work. However,
given that `SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy` offers a
simpler configuration structure, the documentation ceased to
mention `SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` since 2016.

• Introducing a new `[PropertiesConfigurator](manual/configuration.html#propertiesConfigurator)`
component to configure logger levels from a properties file. The
reconfiguration on change task supports watching the designated
properties file(s).

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by building from [source code](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback) at commit

### 2024-08-15 Release of logback version 1.5.7

• Confirmed solution of issue with incorrect
synchronization in `RollingFileAppender`. Issue
reported in [LOGBACK-1711](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1711) by
Gili Tzabari.

• Fixed race condition occurring during configurationr
reloading. This problem was reported
in [LOGBACK-1362](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1362)
by Alexander Kudrevatykh who also provided the relevant test
case.

• Fixed issue with addinng properties following the
valueOf convention into collections. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1445](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1445) by
Steve Lessard who also provided the relevant PR.

• In configuration files, migrated processing of
"conversion rule" elements to model based processing. This solves
[LOGBACK-1547](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1547)
reported by Allen Chow.

• Added `ConsoleCharsetPropertyDefiner` which
computes the charset of the console. However, since certain
methods in the computation require Java 17, the code is available
only in Java 21. This addresses [LOGBACK-1642](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1642)
reported by Garret Wilson.

• The default pattern
for [date
converter](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#date) is "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS"" which can be
shorthened to just the string "ISO8601". However, the ISO8601 date
format specification requires that the date and time parts be
separated by the letter 'T'. However, at the time, logback had
opted for a less strict but more human readable option of
separating the date and time with a
space. In [LOGBACK-262](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-262)
many users asked to change the default to strictly comply with
ISO8601. Due to backward compatibility restrictions, this is not
possible. Nevertheless, the
shorthad [STRICT](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#date)
was added to partially address this issue.

• In case a variable subsitution occurs during
configuration, it will be reported as a status message. This
should help users track how their logback.xml configuration file
is interpreted. Added test cases regarding substitution of
variable in level attribute or level elements. This adresses [LOGBACK-1519](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1519)
reported by Phil Adams.

• Added [**%maskedKvp'**](manual/layouts.html#maskedKvp)
converter which behaves similarly to %kvp except that it will mask
values for specified keys at no additional computational
cost. This was indirecly requested in [issues/828](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/828/)
by Vinit Kumar.

• The `isQueueBelowDiscardingThreshold()` method
in `AsyncAppenderBase` is now public. This was
requested
in [LOGBACK-1436](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1436)
by Roberto Tyley with Erik van Oosten providing the relevant
PR.

• In `SMTPAppender`, updated [smtpHost](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#smtpSmtpHost)
variable's documentation, thus addressing [LOGBACK-1588](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1588)
reported by Micharl Osipov.

• `LoggerContext.stop()` operation is now
performed within a synchronization lock. When a new shutdown hook
is added, any previous hook is automatically removed. This, it no
logger possible to add multiple shutdown hooks but at most
one. This solves [LOGBACK-1551](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1551) as
reported by Dmytro Lisnichenko.

• Moved `LevelChangePropagator` tests from
*logback-classic* to *logback-classic-blackbox* in
relation to [LOGBACK-1578](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1578)
reported by Liro Nykänen.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by building from [source code](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback) at commit

### 2024-07-08 Release of logback-access version 2.0.2

• Fixed issue with "asynchronous" cookies when Jetty 11/12
recycles `Request` objects. This problem was reported
in [issues/11](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access/issues/11)
by You Aoki.

• Fixed a bug whereby included configuration files would
not be handled properly. This problem was reported in
in [issues/14](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access/issues/14)
by Robert Höglund.

not to start the component even if it implements
the `Lifecycle` interface. However, the `@NoAutoStart`
annotation was ignored on interfaces and parent classes. This
issue was reported
in [LOGBACK-1583](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1583)
by Bertrand Renuart who also provided the relevant PR.

• Fixed issue where file inclusion would ignore any
previously defined variables. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1746](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1746) as

duplication in view of the imminent release of [logback-tyler](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-tyler).

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by checking out the tag v\_1.5.1 from the
source code repository (GitHub). Releases built using Java "21"
2023-10-17 LTS build 21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux Debian 11.6.

---

### 2024-02-16 Release of logback version 1.5.0

• When running under JDK 21 and attempting to use virtual
threads `ExecutorServiceUtil` caused
`IllegalAccessException` to be thrown, then caught it
and fell back to using regular threads. In version 1.5.0, the code
fixes this problem via JEP-238, i.e. a multi-release jar. This
issue was reported in [issue/779](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/779)
by Joao Silva.

• When the name of the current thread is null, which is
typically the case for virtual threads, `LoggingEvent`
now extracts the `threadId` to construct the thread
name. This solves [issues/710](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/710)
with Danish Nawab providing the relevant code..

• `JsonEncoder` now allows enabling/disabling
of all top-level json members. Moreover, a new member called
"formattedMessage" can be enabled but is disabled by default.
This fixes [issue/731](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/731)
reported by Madis Pink.

•
`TimeBasedArchiveRemover.ArchiveRemoverRunnable` inner
class is now public.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by checking out the tag v\_1.5.0 from the
source code repository (GitHub). Releases built using Java "21"
2023-10-17 LTS build 21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux Debian 11.6.

### 2023-12-01 Release of logback version 1.2.13

• Fixes for [CVE-2023-6481](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6481)
as well CVE-2023-6378 were back-ported into the 1.2.x
branch. Fixes will be effective only when run under Java 9 and
later.

Note that a successful exploitation of
CVE-2023-6378/CVE-2023-6381 requires that logback-receiver
component is enabled and also reachable by the attacker.

---

### 2023-12-01 Release of logback versions 1.3.14 and 1.4.14

• More complete fix for [CVE-2023-6378](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6378)
both for the 1.4.x series and the 1.3.x series. Many thanks to
Camilo Aparecido Ferri Moreira for pointing out the incomplete fix
via private email. In order to encourage users to upgrade to
versions 1.3.14/1.4.14 [CVE-2023-6481](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6481)
has been created even though the underlying vulnerability for both
CVE records is identical.

Note that the underlying vulnerability for [CVE-2023-6378](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6378)
and [CVE-2023-6481](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6481)
is identical. The latter CVE record was created in order to
encourage users toe upgrade to logback versions 1.3.14/.4.14 or
later. The fixes require JDK 9 to be effective.

Note that a successful exploitation of
CVE-2023-6378/CVE-2023-6481 requires that logback-receiver
component is enabled and also reachable by the attacker.

when scheduling a reconfigure on change task and when removing old
files. This is part of [issue
737](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/issues/737).

• Fixed vulnerability of a potential denial of service
attack on a centralized logback receiver when a third party
controlling a remote appender connects to said receiver and could
shut down or slow down logging of events. This problem was
reported by Yakov Shafranovich, Amazon Web Services. It has been
reported under the reference [CVE-2023-6378](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6378).

**Note that logback versions 1.3.14/1.4.14 provide more
complete fixes for this vulnerability,
i.e. CVE-2023-6378. Moreover, logback version [1.2.13](#1.2.13) also fixes CVE-2023-6378 as well as

### 2023-08-04 Release of logback versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.9

This release was championed by the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/).

• Added an additional configuration step during
initialization using [`SerializedModelConfigurator`](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/master/logback-classic/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/classic/joran/SerializedModelConfigurator.java). See
[configuration
at initialization](manual/configuration.html#auto_configuration) section in the manual for further
details. Configuration from a serialized model file was added
because it executes faster and does not require any XML
libraries. In conjuction with GraalVM, this may yield smaller
executables that start faster.

• In `JsonEncoder` added support for throwable "cause" and
"suppressed" throwables. This fixes [LOGBACK-1749](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1749)
reported by Christopher Holt.

• Fixed `OverlappingFileLockException` when using prudent
mode. This problem was reported by Christian Habermehl in [LOGBACK-1754](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1754).

• Fixed
incorrect status message printed by
`Compressor.gzCompress()` method. This issue was
reported by Marko Mitrović in [LOGBACK-1750](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1750)
who also provided the relevant PR.

• The default implementation of `getInstant` method in
`ILoggingEvent` now returns
`Instant.ofEpochMills(getTimeStamp())` instead of
`null`. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1735](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1735) by
"wreulicke" who also provided the relevant PR.

• The "logback.statusListenerClass" system property now admits
the case insensitive string "STDOUT" in addition to the string
"SYSOUT" as shorthands for the class name
"ch.qos.logback.core.status.OnConsoleStatusListener".

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by checking out the tag v\_1.3.9 (or v\_1.4.9) from the

---

### 2022-10-02 Release of logback versions 1.3.2 and 1.4.2

• Significantly improved the performance of
`LogbackMDCAdapter`, i.e. logback's implementation of
[org.slf4j.spi.MDCAdapter](https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/spi/MDCAdapter.html).
This was requested in [LOGBACK-1684](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1684) by
Sami Korhonen.

• Fixed issue with `<appender-ref>`
elements embedded within
`<if>`/`<then>`/`<else>` blocks. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1673](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1673)
reported by Juan Pablo Santos Rodriguez.

• Fixed issue with sub-elements of
>shutdownHook< element in configuration files. Joran now
correctly handles these elements. This fixes [LOGBACK-1672](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1672)
reported by Juan Pablo Santos Rodriguez.

• Joran now automatically renames
`ch.qos.logback.core.​hook.DelayingShutdownHook` class name as

another appender, logback will now emit a warning message. This
change was made in response to [LOGBACK-1674](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1674)
reported by Luke Stephenson.

• Unit tests were migrated from Junit 4 to Junit 5. Certain tests
are now Jigsaw/JPMS modularized and run on the modules-path. These
are located in so alled "blackbox" modules, namely
*logback-core-blackbox* and
*logback-classic-blackbox*.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by checking out the tag v\_1.3.2 (or v\_1.4.2) from the

---

### 2022-08-28 Release of logback versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0

Here is a list of changes with respect to the previous
version.

• Logback-classic now initializes itself using a default
[`Configurator`](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/master/logback-classic/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/Configurator.java)
provider called [`DefaultJoranConfigurator`](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/master/logback-classic/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/classic/util/DefaultJoranConfigurator.java). Users
can overiride the default configurator by installing their own
custom `Configurator` provider as a [loadable
service](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).

• The `ch.qos.logback.classic.jmx` package was
removed for security reasons and for lack of use.

• Fixed incorrect initialization of
`java.time.DateTimeFormatter` in
`CachingDateFormat` class. This fixes [LOGBACK-1659](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1659)
kindly reported by Bertrand Renuart.

• Fixed performance issue in
`FileFilterUtil.filesInFolderMatchingStemRegex` method
reported in [LOGBACK-1409](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1409)by
Abdy Wilkinson with David Schlosnagle providing the relevant
PR.

• In logback-access, fixed the retreival of the response
status using comitted state. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1580](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1580) by
joakime Joakim Erdfelt who also provided the relevant PR.

• In logback-access, fixed error handling in the
`getRequestContent` and
`buildRequestParameterMap` methods in
`AccessEvent` class. Joakim Erdfelt provided the
relevant PR.

• Fixed a number of issues related to the `nanosecond` field
in `LoggingEvent`. These were reported in [LOGBACK-1657](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1657) [LOGBACK-1661](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1661) by
Bertrand Renuart.

• Fixed a number of issues related to the
`sequenceNumber` field in
`LoggingEvent`. These were reported in [LOGBACK-1662](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1662) [LOGBACK-1663](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1663) by
Bertrand Renuart.

• Logback-classic now prints its version number at
initialization. This information is also available via the
`logbackVersion()` method in
`ch.qos.logback.core.​util.EnvUtil`. This feature was
requested in [LOGBACK-1597](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1597) by
Gabe Tobias with Bertrand Renuart providing the relevant PR.

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be
reproduced by checking out the tag v\_1.3.0 (or v\_1.4.0) from the
source code repository (GitHub). Release built using Java "18"
2022-03-22 build 18+36-2087 under Linux Debian 9.5.

---

### 2022-08-09 Release of logback version 1.3.0-beta0

• Escape sequences are no longer interpreted for the
attribute named `value` defined in the <variable>
element in configuration files. By escape sequences we mean the
escape sequences for Java String literals such as '\t' or '\n'.

The `value` attribute of the <variable>
element was the only place such interpretation was
performed. However, after reviewing the code, it was determined
that there was no need to interpret any such escape sequence. We
estimate that this change will be transparent to end-users.

• Better error handling of configuration files with a missing
<if> element in an if/then pair. See also [LOGBACK-1651](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1651).

• Better error handling of configuration files where
variables are read from a malformed properties file. See also [LOGBACK-1652](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1652).

• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by
checking out the tag v\_1.3.0-beta0 from the source code
repository (GitHub). Release built using Java "18" 2022-03-22
build 18+36-2087 under Linux Debian 9.5.

---

### 2022-05-19 Release of logback version 1.3.0-alpha16

• Restored `SiftingAppender` functionality
which was removed during the rewrite of Joran.

• Second phase filtering of Models is now done by
annotation. This fixes [LOGBACK-1638](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1638)
and [LOGBACK-1639](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1639).

A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by
checking out the tag v\_1.3.0-alpha16 from the source code
repository (GitHub). Release built using Java "18" 2022-03-22
build 18+36-2087 under Linux Debian 9.5.

---

### 2022-05-09 Release of logback version 1.3.0-alpha15

This release is championed by [commercetools](https://commercetools.com/), a leader
company in digital commerce.

• Restored support for "if/then/else" elements in
configuration files. This fixes [LOGBACK-1625](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1625). When
defining XML to Model transformation rules, a new rule has to be
passed a `Supplier` of `Action` instances
instead of a single (potentially re-used) `Action`
instance. This change simplifies the logic of `Action`
code, as an `Action` instance will never be reused,
making configurations easier to debug.

• Many bugs reported by Google OSS-fuzz have been
fixed. These bugs relate to invalid and sometimes even wildly
invalid inputs which should not occur in legitimate deployments of
logback.

• Fixed NPE in `ThrowableProxy` if
`extractSupressedThrowables` method returns null. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1623](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1623)
reported by Oyvind Horneland.

A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by
checking out the tag v\_1.3.0-alpha15 from the source code
repository (GitHub). Release built using Java "18" 2022-03-22

### 2022-04-20 Release of **logback.db** version 1.2.11.1

As of logback version 1.2.8 `DBAppender` no longer
ships with logback. However,
`DBAppender` for logback-classic is
available under the following Maven coordinates:

`ch.qos.logback.db:logback-classic-db:1.​2.11.1`

and for *logback-access* under

`ch.qos.logback.db:logback-access-db:1.​2.11.1`

Both of these artifacts require
`ch.qos.logback.db:logback-core-db:1.​2.11.1` which will
be pulled in automatically by Maven's transitivity rules.

• This release corrects the artifact name of logback-classic-db
fixing [LOGBACK-1631](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1631) as
reported by Juan Pablo Santos Rodriguez.

---

### 2022-04-15 Release of **logback.db** version 1.2.11

As of logback version 1.2.8 `DBAppender` no longer
ships with logback. However, the logback-db project remedies this
omission.

---

### 2022-03-05 Release of version 1.2.11

•  Backported fix for [LOGBACK-1027](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1027).

•  Fixed incorrect `String` cast in
`JNDIUtil`. This corrects [LOGBACK-1604](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1604)
reported by Chris Cheshire.

•  In `SMTPAppenderBase` empty username
parameter is now treated the same `null`. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1594](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1594)
reported by Mark Woon who also provided the relevant PR.

---

### 2021-02-11 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha14

•  A bug was introduced in 1.3.0-alpha13 which caused
the second appender-ref declaration to be ignored. This issue is
described in [LOGBACK-1614](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1614)
based on an initial report by C. Ahlers in the logback-user
mailing list.

---

### 2021-01-31 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha13

•  Starting with version 1.3.0-alpha13 logback
releases are reproducible. This means that anyone checking out the
code corresponding to the release version from GitHub and building
that local copy, will get obtain an identical binary to the binary
found on Maven central. Note that due
to [issue
MJAR-275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJAR-275) with the *module-info.java* produced in
earlier java versions, reproducible builds require Java 18.

•  Once the `Model` is created from XML
configuration file, `Model` processing is now
independent of any XML related code. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1613](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1613).

•  Fixed incorrect `String` cast in
`JNDIUtil`. This corrects [LOGBACK-1604](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1604)
reported by Chris Cheshire.

•  In `SMTPAppenderBase` empty username
parameter is now treated same as `null`. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1594](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1594)
reported by Mark Woon who also provided the relevant PR.

---

### 2021-12-23 Release of version 1.2.10

•  `ContextInitializer` no longer
complains about missing *logback.groovy* configuration
file. This fixes [LOGBACK-1601](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1601).

---

### 2021-12-22 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha12

**Note that 1.3.0-alpha12 contains the same security related
changes as version 1.3.0-alpha11 and 1.2.9.**

• Logback events now store time using
`java.time.Instant` which supports nanosecond
resolution. This fixes [LOGBACK-1374](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1374)
and also [LOGBACK-1599](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1599).

•  Properties in an unreferenced appender no longer
cause warnings from `ImplicitModelHandler`. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1572](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1572).

•  Properties in an unreferenced appender no longer
cause warnings from `ImplicitModelHandler`. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1572](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1572).

•  `ContextInitializer` no longer
complains about missing *logback.groovy* configuration
file. This fixes [LOGBACK-1601](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1601).

### 2021-12-16 Release of version 1.2.9

We note that the vulnerability mentioned in
CVE-2021-42550 requires write access to logback's configuration
file as a prerequisite. **Please understand
that [log4Shell](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-44228) and
[CVE-2021-42550](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-42550) are
of different severity levels.**

In response to [CVE-2021-42550](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-42550) (aka [LOGBACK-1591](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1591)) we
have decided to make the following steps.

1) Hardened logback's JNDI lookup mechanism to only honor
requests in the `java:` namespace. All other types of
requests are ignored. Many thanks to Michael Osipov for suggesting
this change and providing the relevant PR.

2) `SMTPAppender` was hardened.

3) Temporarily removed DB support for security reasons.

4) Removed Groovy configuration support. As logging is so
pervasive and configuration with Groovy is probably too powerful,
this feature is unlikely to be reinstated for security
reasons.

We note that the aforementioned vulnerability requires write
access to logback's configuration file as a prerequisite. Please
understand that [log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-44228)
and [CVE-2021-42550](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-42550)
are of different severity levels. A successful RCE attack with
CVE-2021-42550 requires *all* of the following conditions
to be met:

1. write access to logback.xml
2. use of versions < 1.2.9
3. reloading of poisoned configuration data, which implies
   application restart or scan="true" set prior to attack

As an additional extra precaution, in addition to upgrading to
logback version 1.2.9, we also recommend users to set their
logback configuration files as read-only.

---

### 202-12-16 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha11

Note that 1.3.0-alpha11 contains the same security related
changes as version 1.2.9.

• Migrated from `javax.servlet`
to `jakarta.servlet`. This entails migration to Tomcat
version 10.0.10 and Jetty version 11.0.6 in logback-access. This
fixes
[LOGBACK-1575](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1575)
reported by Daniel Svensson. Note that Jetty version 11 requires
Java version 11 or later.

• Added [hostnameVerification](manual/usingSSL.html#parametersHostnameVerification)
to property `SSLSocketAppender`. This fixes [LOGBACK-1574](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1574) as
reported by Andrei Komarov with Bruno Harbulot providing the
relevant patch.

---

### 2021-12-14 Release of version 1.2.8

• In response to [CVE-2021-42550](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-42550) and [LOGBACK-1591](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1591) we
have decided to make the following steps.

1) we have disabled all JNDI lookup code in logback until further
notice. This impacts [ContextJNDISelector](manual/loggingSeparation.html#ContextJNDISelector)
and <insertFromJNDI> element in configuration files.

2) we have removed all database (JDBC) related code in the
project with no replacement.

---

### 2021-11-11 - Release of version 1.2.7

• Added [hostnameVerification](manual/usingSSL.html#parametersHostnameVerification)
to property `SSLSocketAppender`. This fixes [LOGBACK-1574](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1574) as
reported by Andrei Komarov with Bruno Harbulot providing the
relevant patch.

---

### 2021-09-10 Release of version 1.2.6

• To prevent XML eXternal Entity injection (XXE) attacks, Joran
no longer reads external entities passed in XML files. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1465](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1465)
as reported by Shuibo Ye.

---

### 2021-08-23 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha10

• `CachingDateFormatter` is now
synchronization-free and performs about 30 times faster. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1421](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1421).

• `AsyncAppenderBase` now drains its buffer in
one go, considerably improving throughput. See [benchmarking results](performance.html) for further
details.

• `ThrowableProxy` now supports circular
exceptions. This fixes [LOGBACK-1027](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1027)
with Jan S. (jpstotz) providing the relevant patch.

• `LogbackServiceProvider` now invokes
`LoggerContext.start()` method upon completion of
initialization. This fixes [LOGBACK-1121](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1121)
reported by Johannes Herr.

• Better error reporting in case of missing right curly brace
during variable substitution. This fixes [LOGBACK-1417](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1417).

• Better error reporting in case of unknown properties in
components when reading XML configuration files. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1570](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1570).

• Utility method
`ConcerterUtil.setContextForConverters(​)` now handles
`CompositeConverter` instances correctly. This fixes [LOGBACK-1571](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1571).

---

### 2021-08-13 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha9

• In `ILoggingEvent`, added a `getMarker()`
method with a default implementation returning the first marker in
the marker list. This method is deprecated and exists solely for
backward compatibility reasons. Logback components should use
`getMarkerList()` and cater for all available markers and
not only the first marker. This fixes [LOGBACK-1569](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1569)
reported by Pelle Krøgholt .

---

### 2021-08-12 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha8

• Upped the requested slf4j-api version by
`LogbackServiceProvider` to 2.0.99 instead of
1.8.99. This fixes [LOGBACK-1568](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1568).

---

### 2021-08-10 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha7

• `AccessEvent` in the logback-access module now tries
to get a reference to a given `HttpRequest` session
without trying to create it if missing. This fixes [LOGBACK-1219](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1219)
reported by Chris West with Iliya Krapchatov providing the
relevant patch.

• To prevent XML eXternal Entity injection (XXE) attacks, Joran
no longer reads external entities passed in XML files. This fixes
[LOGBACK-1465](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1465)
as reported by Shuibo Ye.

• The *logback-access* module now supports Jetty version
9.4.9 and Tomcat version 9.0.50, the latest versions compatible
with Java 8.

• Migrated `SMTPAppender` to use
`jakarta.mail` instead of `javax.mail`. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1516](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1516).

• Added the [kvp](manual/layouts.html#kvp) conversion
word in logback-classic in order to support
`KeyValuePair`. `KeyValuePair` is part of
the fluent API introduced in SLF4J 2.0.

• Patterns with composite converters now correctly detect if
child converters handle exceptions. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1566](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1566).

• Removed unused dependency on the
edu.washington.cs.​types.checker:checker-framework artifact. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1501](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1501)
reported by Jeremy Landis.

Implementation of
`TargetLengthBasedClassNameAbbreviator` has been both
simplified and augmented with an LRU cache. This fixes [LOGBACK-1509](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1509)
reported by Michael Skells who also provided a relevant PR.

### 2021-07-28 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha6

Joran, logback's configuration system, has been rewritten to
use an internal representation model which can be processed
separately. As a side effect, logback configuration scripts are
now largely order-free. For example, appenders can now be defined
after they are first referenced in a logger. Moreover,
unreferenced appenders are no longer instantiated. Given the
breadth of the changes in Joran codebase, support for
`SiftingAppender` and Groovy configuration have been
dropped temporarily.

In addition to the important Joran and Jigsaw modularization
changes mentioned above, this version contains the same fixes as
in logback versions 1.2.4 and 1.2.5.

---

### 2021-07-26 Release of version 1.2.5

Instead of an `Appender`, the
`LayoutWrappingEncoder` now accepts a variable of type
`ContextAware` as a parent. This fixes [LOGBACK-1326](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1326) as
reported by Phil Clay who also provided the relevant patch.

---

### 2021-07-19 Release of version 1.2.4

Added support for minimum length in %i filename pattern. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1248](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1248)
with John Gardiner Myers providing the relevant patch.

For size bound log file archiving, allow
`TimeBasedArchiveRemove` to remove files with indexes
containing up to 5 digits. This fixes [LOGBACK-1175](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1175).

Added [`%prefix`](manual/layouts.html#prefix)
composite converter which automatically prefixes child converter
output with the name of the converter. This feature is quite handy
in environments where log files need to be parsed and monitored.
tools.

---

### 2019-10-11 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha5

ConsoleAppender now delegates filtering of ANSI sequences to
Jansi. This fixes [LOGBACK-1392](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1392)
reported by Alexandre Dutra who also provided the relevant patch.

---

### 2018-02-11 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha4

Given that all currently available versions of Groovy are
incompatible with Java 9, at least when built with Maven, we
have momentarily **dropped support for Groovy
configuration**, a.k.a Gaffer. For details refer to [this
thread](http://markmail.org/thread/nekeppbvwrfl7hbb#query:+page:1+mid:obdyvuv24kqpxm6v+state:results) and relevant [jira
issue.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8471)

Due to lack of user interest, logback-classic no longer
supports [logging
separation](manual/loggingSeparation.html) by way of `ContextSelector`.

Under JPMS (Java 9), module `ch.qos.logback.core` is
now able to read module `java.xml`. This fixes [LOGBACK-1381](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1381)
reported by Mark Raynsford.

---

### February 10th, 2018, Release of version 1.3.0-alpha3

Under JPMS (Java 9), allow user code to implement
`ch.qos.logback.classic.​spi.Configurator` as a
service. This fixes [LOGBACK-1380](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1380)
reported by Mark Raynsford.

Fix issue with properties containing JSON strings as reported
in [LOGBACK-1101](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1101).

---

### 2018-01-30 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha2

Depend on SLF4J version 1.8.0-beta1 instead of
1.8.0-beta1-SNAPSHOT.

Fix build under Travis.

### 2018-01-30 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha1

In the absence of a class attribute,
the `shutdownHook` configuration directive now
correctly assumes
`ch.qos.logback.core.​hook.DefaultShutdownHook`
class. This fixes [LOGBACK-1162](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1162)
reported by Alex Selesse.

Logback's internal `ThreadPoolExecutor` now has an
initial pool of 1 thread instead of 8 previously.

TimeBasedArchiveRemover is now able to deal with indexes over
999. This fixes [LOGBACK-1175](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1175)
reported by Diego Furtado who also provided the relevant PR.

`SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy` will correctly
remove archived log files created within a given time period even
if the last modified date for said files has been modified since
archiving or is otherwise incorrect. This fixes [LOGBACK-1361](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1361) as
reported by Peter Risko.

String to Level conversion now handles strings with tailing
spaces. This fixes [LOGBACK-1288](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1288)
reported by Gaurav Khanna.

`MDCFilter` will enforce the presence of
`MDCKey` and `value` properties, refusing to
start when either property absent. This fixes [LOGBACK-1165](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1165)
reported by Martin Steiger.

Added the feature to update mime message before sending the
email. This enhancement was requested in [LOGBACK-1284](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1284) by
Miguel Vale who also provided the relevant PR.

If omitted, the scanPeriod
attribute in configuration file defaults to 1 minute. The
documentation [stated
as much](manual/configuration.html#autoScan) but the code had not followed through. This issue was
reported in [LOGBACK-1194](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1194)
with F. Buechler providing the appropriate patch.

Updated JavaMail version to 1.6. This fixes [LOGBACK-1094](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1094)
reported by Romain Moreau.

Removed "final" modifier for the
`LoggerContext.getLogger(​String)` method. This fixes [LOGBACK-1308](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1308)
reported by Richard Sand.

---

### 2018-01-18 Release of version 1.3.0-alpha0

Added support for minimum length in %i filename pattern. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1248](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1248)
with John Gardiner Myers providing the relevant patch.

Correct parsing of `java.version` system property
for Java 9 and later. This fixes [LOGBACK-1260](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1260)
with Patrick Reinhart providing the relevant patch.

ConsoleAppender now works with consoles confused by output
strings of zero length, e.g. Java Web Start. This fixes issue [LOGBACK-1282](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1282)
reported by Clas Forsberg.

---

### 2017-03-30 Release of version 1.2.3

Fix unintentional dependency on
`OutputStreamAppender` in
`LayoutWrappingEncoder` as reported in [LOGBACK-1287](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1287).

Fix spurious `System.out.println` in AsyncAppender's
worker thread. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-1292](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1292) by
Nikolas Loutas with Thibault Meyer the relevant patch.

ConsoleAppender exception when run under Java WebStart. This
problem was reported in [LOGBACK-1282](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1282) by
Clas Forsberg.

### 2017-03-16 Release of version 1.2.2

`AsyncAppender` no longer drops events when the
current thread has its interrupt flag set. This issue was reported
in [LOGBACK-1247](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1247) by
Jakob Bergendahl who also provided the relevant pull request.

Removed `JMSQueueAppender` and
`JMSTopicAppender`. These appenders were undocumented
and had no apparent users.

Remove comment in logback-classic's
`META-INF/services/​javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer`
file in order to keep Wildfly 8 happy. This issue was reported in
[LOGBACK-1265](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1265)
by Andy Wilkinson.

`FileSize.toString()` now reports files sizes in GB
in addition to sizes in MB and KB and Bytes. This fixes issue [LOGBACK-1278](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1278).

---

### March 1st, 2017, Release of version 1.1.11

Fix thread-safety issue with `PatternLayoutBase`
reported in [LOGBACK-1270](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1270) by
Artem Bilan. Note that the fix was already present in the 1.2.x
series and was back-ported to the 1.1.x series.

---

### February 9th, 2017, Release of version 1.2.1

To ensure backward compatibility of configuration files, the
immediateFlush property set for a
`LayoutWrappingEncoder` is propagated to the enclosing
`OutputStreamAppender`.

---

### 2017-02-08 Release of version 1.2.0

#### `Encoder` interface has changed and is no longer expected to handle an `OutputStream`.

`Encoder` interface has changed and is no longer
expected to handle an `OutputStream`. This
simplification allows finer-grain locking resulting in [significantly
improved performance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpb5D7qnyye4W0RTlHUnXedYK98catNZytYIu5D91m0/edit?usp=sharing).

Release 1.2.0 fixes a rather severe
serialization vulnerability in `SocketServer` and
`ServerSocketReceiver`. Users running these components
should upgrade immediately.

This release fixes a rather severe serialization vulnerability
in `SocketServer` and
`ServerSocketReceiver`. Users running these components
should upgrade immediately.

In `TimeBasedRollingPolicy`, fixed issue with totalSizeCap of more than 2^31. This problem
was reported in [1231](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1231) by Simon
Teng.

Logback-classic now searches for the file
*logback-test.xml* first, *logback.groovy* second
and *logback.xml* third. In previous versions
*logback.groovy* was looked up first which was nonsensical
in presence of *logback-test.xml*. This fixes [LOGBACK-1245](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1245)
reported by Joern Huxhorn.

---

### 2017-02-05 Release of version 1.1.10

Several changes to improve throughput (see [**spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpb5D7qnyye4W0RTlHUnXedYK98catNZytYIu5D91m0/edit?usp=sharing))

1. The `ReentrantLock` in
   `OutputStreamAppender` is now "unfair". In previous
   versions of logback, a fair lock was used. Fair locks are much
   slower. Just as importantly, logback has no mandate to influence
   thread scheduling.
2. `FileAppender` now offers the bufferSize option. Previously, a
   fixed-size 8K buffer was used. Increasing the bufferSize, for example to 256K,
   significantly reduces thread-contention.
3. Critical parts of the code now use
   `COWArrayList`, a custom developed allocation-free
   lock-free thread-safe implementation of the {@link List}
   interface. It is optimized for cases where iterations over the
   list vastly outnumber modifications on the list. It is based on
   `CopyOnWriteArrayList` but allows allocation-free
   iterations over the list.
4. In `PatternLayoutBase` the same
   `StringBuilder` is used over and over to reduce
   memory allocation. This is safe as long as the owning appender
   guarantees serial access to its layout. In the next version of
   logback, i.e. 1.2.x, the read-write lock will no longer protect
   access to the layout and there will be no guarantee of
   serial access.

In web-applications, logback-classic will [automatically
install a listener](manual/configuration.html#webShutdownHook) which will stop the logging context and
release resources when your web-app is reloaded. This enhancement
was requested [LOGBACK-1170](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1170) by
Martin Wegner.

The `AccessEvent.prepareForDeferredProcessing(​)`
method was not idempotent. This caused subtle bugs under
Jetty. See [LOGBACK-1189](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1189)
for details. Many thanks to Per Olesen, Evan Meagher, Nick Babcock
and Mark Elliot for hunting down this bug.

As it may be time-consuming in certain environments, the
HOSTNAME property is now computed lazily. This optimization
requested in [LOGBACK-1221](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1221) by
Eugene Petrenko.

Joran now supports external XML entities. This feature was
requested in [1091](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1091) and the
relevant PR graciously provided by Jonas Neukomm.

---

### 2017-01-20 Release of version 1.1.9

Logback's internal executor service had a thread pool size of 2
which could be used up rather quickly, e.g. configuration scanning
in addition to an active `ServerSocketAppender`. When
both threads where permanently in use, compression could not
proceed. To alleviate this problem, the thread pool size has been
increased to 8. See issue [LOGBACK-1238](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1238)
for more details.

Fixed issue with `FileAppender` instances embedded
within `SiftingAppender` reporting filename collisions
after reaching timeout and subsequently restarted. This problem
was reported in [LOGBACK-1167](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1167) by
Michael Edgar.

Fixed `SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` deprecation warning
emitted even the replacement,
i.e. `SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy`, is in use. See [LOGBACK-1236](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1236). This
issue was reported by Claudius Nicolae.

Added proper implementation for
`LogbackValve.getScheduledExecutorService(​)` method. The
missing implementation manifested itself in the form of an
`UnsupportedOperationException` thrown by
LogbackValve. This problem is further described in [LOGBACK-1181](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1181)
reported by Andreas von Roepenack.

### 2016-12-09 Release of version 1.1.8

Removed the two period safeguard, aka untouchable periods, for
archive removal beyond the size specified by totalSizeCap in
`TimeBasedRollingPolicy`. It turns out the safeguard is
not required and is unexpected as attested by [LOGBACK-1166](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1166).

Fixed issue with Joran incorrectly reporting "Unexpected
aggregationType AS\_BASIC\_PROPERTY\_COLLECTION". This issue was
raised in [LOGBACK-1158](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1158) by
Christian Hübner.

Gaffer (logback's groovy configurator) now supports the
`valueOf` convention. This issue was raised in [LOGBACK-1232](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1232) by
Frans Orsel.

The `org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder` class
shipping in logback-classic no longer catches
`Throwable` but `Exception`. This change was
requested in [LOGBACK-1159](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1159) by
David J. M. Karlsen.

`BeanDescriptionFactory` no longer outputs a
superfluous warning message in case the class contains bridge
methods. This fixes [LOGBACK-1164](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1164)
reported by Phil Clay.

---

### 2016-03-29 Release of version 1.1.7

Logback is now [compact3
profile](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/compactprofiles/compactprofiles.html) compatible. This improvement was requested in [LOGBACK-1071](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1071) by
Axel Fontaine with Max Urech providing the relevant pull-request.

Fixed `ConcurrentModificationException` being thrown
when the `reset()` method is invoked on the
`LoggerContext` instance. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-397](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-397) by
Szczepan Faber with Ross Sargant providing the relevant test case.

`TimeBasedRollingPolicy` now supports the [totalSizeCap](manual/appenders.html#tbrpTotalSizeCap) property which allows the
user to limit the total size of archived logs.

[`SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy`](manual/appenders.html#SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy)
offers the same functionality as
`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` did previously but with a
simpler configuration structure.

Archive removal by `RollingFileAppender` is now
performed asynchronously.

Unnecessary and incompatible %i token in fileNamePattern option with
`RollingFileAppender/​TimeBasedRollingPolicy` is now
detected and the user alerted to the misconfiguration
problem. This fixes [LOGBACK-1143](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1143).

Joran can now handle logger names ending with a $, i.e. the
first character in variable substitution. This issue was raised in
[LOGBACK-1149](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1149)
by by Stevo Slavic.

---

### 2016-02-29 Release of version 1.1.6

`LogbackValve` (in logback-access) now attempts to
load the configuration file as a resource if it cannot be found on
the filesystem ([LOGBACK-1069](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1069)). This
is helpful in scenarios where applications are using an embedded
Tomcat server.

`JMXConfigurator.​reloadDefaultConfiguration(​)`
method now tolerates programmatic configuration without a
URL. This change was provided by Vedran Pavic in [PR 302](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/pull/302).

`RollingFileAppender` will output an error message
if the date time pattern in the %d token within the fileNamePattern is not collision free. This
fixes [LOGBACK-1137](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1137). In
a similar vein, every instance of `FileAppender` will
now detect if it shares the same File
option value as given for an appender defined earlier. In
addition, `RollingFileAppender` instances now check for
colliding FileNamePattern values.

Fixed `NullPointerException` thrown by
`RollingFileAppender` if the name of the rollover
target path did not contain a parent. This issue was reported in
[LOGBACK-1054](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1054)
by Paulius Matulionis. Analysis of the problem and the relevant PR
was provided by Ferenc Palkovics.

`BasicConfigurator.configure` method call executes
significantly faster. Improved documentation for configuration
using JDK 1.6 service-provider facility. These changes are in
response to [LOGBACK-1141](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1141)
requesting faster logback start-up time.

Fixed issue with variable substitution with the value ending in
a colon. This problem was reported in [LOGBACK-1140](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1140) by
Eric Cook.

---

### February 13th, 2016, Release of version 1.1.5

#### MDC values are no longer inherited by child threads.

Child threads no longer inherit MDC values. In previous
versions of logback as well as log4j 1.x, MDC values were
inherited by child threads. Several users have argued convincingly
that MDC inheritance by child threads was unhelpful and even
dangerous. This change fixes [LOGBACK-422](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-422) and [LOGBACK-624](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-624)

When the `FileNamePattern` string for
`RollingFileAppender/​SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` lacks a %i
token, then compression for the second archive in the same period
cannot occur as the target file already exists. Under those
circumstances, logback leaves behind .tmp files as reported in [LOGBACK-992](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-992), [LOGBACK-173](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-173) and
[LOGBACK-920](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-920). In
this release, this particular condition is detected by
`RollingFileAppender` which will not start but alert
the user instead.

AsyncAppender is now configurable to never block. This feature
was requested by Jeff Wartes in [LOGBACK-898](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-898) with
Jeff Wartes and Gareth Davis providing the relevant patch.

---

### 2016-02-11 Release of version 1.1.4

#### Logback 1.1.4 requires SLF4J version 1.7.16 or later.

Added event replay support as introduced in SLF4J version
1.7.15. In most circumstances, logback-classic should run fine with
earlier versions of slf4j-api, including all versions in the 1.6.x
and 1.7.x series. However, with a version of slf4j-api.jar earlier
than 1.7.15 in the classpath, attempting introspection of a
`Logger` instance will result in a
`NoClassDefFoundError` similar to that shown below.

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/event/​LoggingEvent
        at java.lang.Class.​getDeclaredMethods0(​Native Method)
        at java.lang.Class.​privateGetDeclaredMethods(​Class.java:2451)
        at java.lang.Class.​privateGetPublicMethods(​Class.java:2571)

        at java.beans.Introspector.​getBeanInfo(Introspector.​java:161)

```
#### Packaging data (as output in stack traces) is now disabled by default.

In case an application throws exceptions frequently, then
computing packaging data can be very costly and will cause the
application to run slower. Making bad worse. To alleviate this
problem, packaging data is no longer computed by default. It has
to be [enabled
explicitly](manual/configuration.html#packagingData). In the absence of explicit instructions, i.e. the
user has not specified a converter handling exceptions,
`PatternLayout` in logback-classic will follow the
settings defining for the logging environment. If packaging data
is disabled, then it add %ex as a suffix in the pattern, and if
packaging data is enabled then %xEx will be added. These changes
fix [LOGBACK-730](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-730) and
[LOGBACK-966](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-966).

Fixed a bug in
`TimeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicyBase` causing
time-based rolling policies to always rollover according to the
local system time and ignore the time zone passed in the file name
pattern. The issue was reported by Lukasz Sanek who also provided
the relevant fix.

`AsyncAppenderBase` now restores the current
thread's interrupt flag when catching an
`InterruptedException`. The issue
([LOGBACK-910](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-910)) was
raised by Henrik Nordvik who also provided the relevant fix.

---

### 2015-03-24 Release of version 1.1.3

#### As of version 1.1.3, all logback modules require JDK 1.6 instead of previously JDK 1.5. This change was put to consultation on the logback mailing lists with no objections raised.

Fixed `FileAppender`'s prudent mode so that it properly recovers
from IO Errors
([LOGBACK-1046](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1046))

Irrelevant or internal stack trace lines can now be omitted. Pull request
provided by Tomasz Nurkiewicz
([LOGBACK-540](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-540)).

`AccessEvent` now creates a copy of request attributes when
its `prepareForDeferredProcessing(​)` method is called. This makes
attributes visible even if an appender uses a background thread to process
events.
([LOGBACK-1033](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1033))

All threads opened by `ch.qos.logback.core.​util.ExecutorServiceUtil#THREAD_FACTORY`
are now daemons, which fixes an application hang on shutdown when `LoggerContext#stop()`
is not called ([LOGBACK-929](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-929)).
Note that daemon threads are abruptly terminated by the JVM, which may cause
undesirable results, such as corrupted files written by the `FileAppender`.
It is still highly recommended for the application to call `LoggerContext#stop()`
(e.g., in a shutdown hook) to gracefully shutdown appenders.

Fixed an issue with `RollingFileAppender` where the first
rollover file could be unintentionally deleted, depending on the specified
filename pattern
([LOGBACK-894](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-894)).

Fixed an issue with `TeeHttpServletResponse`
where the system default encoding would be used instead of the
response encoding when constructing a new writer
([LOGBACK-1023](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1023)).

Fixed `ConfigurationDelegate.​groovy` to allow any appender
that implements `AppenderAttachable`, which supports third-party
appenders, such as **reactor-logback's** `AsyncAppender`
([LOGBACK-1008](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1008))

Added support for specifying the callstack depth range in the
`PatternLayout`. For example, `%caller{1..2}`
displays the first two calls in the callstack.

Added HTTP request method to `MDCInsertingServletFilter`.

Fixed time-zone dependent code in `RollingCalendarTest`.
([LOGBACK-116](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-116))

Simplified connection logic of SocketAppender to reduce multithreading
overhead and unnecessary instantiation of `SocketConnector`
objects.

Fixed race condition in `SMTPAppenderBase` causing missing or
duplicate emails.
([LOGBACK-909](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-909))

Fixed an issue with `FileAppender` in prudent mode, where
an interrupt could prevent further access to the file
([LOGBACK-875](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-875)).

Fixed `IllegalStateException` when multiple threads
write files to same directory
([LOGBACK-128](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-128)).

Changed queue consumption strategy in `AbstractSocketAppender`
from "take" to "peek/remove" in order to avoid losing an event on each socket
connection break. Zero is now a deprecated queue size. A queue size of one
should be taken instead to indicate synchronous processing.
([LOGBACK-977](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-977))

`RequestLogImpl` now has an overridable `configure`
method to allow extending implementations to configure it via methods
other than the `logback-access.xml` file.

Fixed a bug in `AccessEvent` which could cause any
`AsyncAppender` based appender to corrupt the request
headers, request parameters, or response headers, before logging.

SQL scripts to set up your logback database are now provided as
JAR resources
([LOGBACK-948](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-948)).

Threads created internally by logback are now named
*logback-n*, where *n* is an integer. For the
first thread *n* is set to 1, for each successive thread
*n* is incremented by 1.

Added max runtime parameter to `AsyncAppender` to allow
the appender to flush events, up to a maximum delay, during a stop
of the LoggerContext. This can be used to ensure that all queued
events are flushed.

Added new configuration element `shutdownHook` to allow the
user to specify a ShutdownHook implementation that will stop the Logback
context upon JVM exit.

`BasicStatusManager` now prevents adding more than
one instance of `OnConsoleStatusListener` as a status
listener. This fixes [LOGBACK-976](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-976).

`TimeBasedRollingPolicy` now accepts a time zone in
its `%d` conversion pattern. ([LOGBACK-611](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-611))

It is now possible to configure the character encoding used by
`SyslogAppender` to encode messages using the
`setCharset()` method. This fixes [LOGBACK-732](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-732)

### 2014-04-02 Release of version 1.1.2

Create an abstract method, createOutputStream, as an extension point
for subclasses of SyslogBaseAppender to create their own OutputStream.
[LOGBACK-890](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-890)

Removed deprecated constructors in `SocketAppender`
and related classes.

Fixed incorrect date format in `SyslogAppender`.
([LOGBACK-936](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-936))

Fixed `NullPointerException` when substituting blank variables
([LOGBACK-959](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-959))

Fixed `NullPointerException` that occurs when stopping a
`SyslogAppender` that did not properly initialize, e.g.,
due to a hostname resolution failure.
([LOGBACK-960](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-960))

Use fair locking in `OutputStreamAppender`. Patch provided by
Sergey Bykov.
([LOGBACK-268](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-268))

In case of missing included files, IncludeAction no longer
prints a stack trace but prints a warning instead. ([LOGBACK-954](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-954))

Fixed character escaping in XMLLayout
([LOGBACK-728](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-728))
and HTMLLayout
([LOGBACK-440](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-440)).

---

### 2014-02-05 Release of version 1.1.1

Logback now supports an unlimited level of [variable](manual/configuration.html#variableSubstitution)
resolution graphs rather than being limited to one level deep
resolution. This enhancement was requested by Anton Wiedermann in
[LOGBACK-943](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-943)
with Eric Dahl providing the relevant pull request.

Fixed [LOGBACK-942](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-942) which
was causing `SocketAppender` to drop events. Eric Dahl
provided the relevant pull request.

---

### 2014-01-28 Release of version 1.1.0

Previously, logback silently ignored configuration files that did
not have the ".xml" or ".groovy" file extension. Now, a `LogbackException`
is thrown to flag this error.

Groovy configuration now supports `appenderRef`, which
allows the use of `AsyncAppender` in Groovy.
([LOGBACK-269](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-269))

`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` now supports a protected function
`#createArchiveRemover` that allows subclasses to specify
a custom archive remover used in `RollingFileAppender`. The
default archive remover is `SizeAndTimeBasedArchiveRemover`.

`PackagingDataCalculator` now catches and ignores
`UnsupportedOperationException` so that it can determine
whether the JVM supports `Reflection#getCallerClass()`
without printing that exception's stack trace. This only affects
Java 7u40+, which removed support for `Reflection#getCallerClass()`.
([LOGBACK-885](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-885))

To facilitate debugging, `SimpleSocketServer` now names
its threads: "**Logback SimpleSocketServer (port *PORTNUM*)**".
`SocketNode` client threads are named:
"**Logback SocketNode (client: *IPADDR*)**".

Fixed silently lost messages from `SyslogAppender`
when they exceeded the system datagram size limit. The default max
message size was hard coded to 65KB but now matches the system limit
(as read from
[`DatagramSocket#getSendBufferSize(​)`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/DatagramSocket.html#getSendBufferSize())) unless a
nonzero limit is specified via `SyslogAppender#setMaxMessageSize(​)`.
([LOGBACK-926](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-926))

Fixed various documentation typos, including
[LOGBACK-466](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-466),
[LOGBACK-768](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-768),
[LOGBACK-904](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-904),
[LOGBACK-921](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-921),
and
[LOGBACK-927](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-927).

`ContextBase.setStatusManager` now correctly validates
the given status manager.
([LOGBACK-912](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-912))

The `SocketNode` creates an `ObjectInputStream`
using the socket's input stream, which blocks waiting for the
stream header. This wait has been moved from the constructor to
`SocketNode.run()` so that the node can be created without
blocking.
([LOGBACK-350](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-350))

Fixed `SecurityException` during initialization
in Google AppEngine.
([LOGBACK-760](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-760))

The `<include>` element now allows optional
resources (previously, only optional files).
([LOGBACK-928](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-644))

Added new layout conversion word (**%D** or **%elapsedTime**),
which gets the time taken to serve the request. This applies
only to Jetty and Tomcat logs via logback-access.
([LOGBACK-320](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-320))

Fixed SMTP error when the subject line contained multiple
new-lines.
([LOGBACK-865](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-865))

Fixed unnecessary re-initialization of the servlet's
`LoggerContext` while attempting to destroy it.

Added the following syslog facilities to `SyslogStartConverter`:
NTP, AUDIT, ALERT, CLOCK
([LOGBACK-754](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-754))

Fixed `NullPointerException` when setting a JUL
logger's level to null, which should have reset the logger level
to the parent's effective level.
([LOGBACK-906](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-906))

Added support to get suppressed exceptions. This is currently
only implemented for `RootCauseFirstThrowableProxyConverter`
and `ThrowableProxyConverter`.
([LOGBACK-516](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-516))

Fixed problem of Janino classes not found in some environments
(axis2, GWT, etc.).
([LOGBACK-832](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-832))

Fixed various unit tests, including modifications for consistent
results in Jenkins.
([LOGBACK-842](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-842))

Allow Gaffer to read the `logback.debug` system
property to enable verbose output during Groovy-based configuration.
Also added debug statements to Gaffer.

Fixed `IllegalArgumentException` when missing periods
and dollar signs in the logger name.
([LOGBACK-384](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-384))

Fixed `NullPointerException` during JNDI lookup.

Fixed dangling data source connections from `DBAppender`
that caused *"maximum open cursors exceeded"*.

Fixed incorrect stack trace depth when specifying `%throwable`
with argument.
([LOGBACK-160](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-160))

Fixed MySQL setup script to use lower-case table name to
match the references in the file. This had caused an error
on systems where case sensitivity matters.

Fixed `NullPointerException` when getting code source in
`PackagingDataCalculator`.

The search path for `logback-access.xml` is now
`${catalina.base}` and then `${catalina.home}`
if not found.
([LOGBACK-844](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-844))

The `LoggingEvent` constructor delays message
formatting so that it can be computed lazily by the
`getFormattedMessage` method. This fixes [LOGBACK-873](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-873) and
re-fixes [LOGBACK-495](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-495).

`PackagingDataCalculator` now checks for the case
where the caller has no protection domain. This fixes [LOGBACK-617](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-617)
reported by Yuri de Wit. The relevant fix was provided by Mikhail
Mazursky.

---

### 2013-05-10 Release of version 1.0.13

In logback-access MANIFEST file, imports of Jetty and Tomcat
are now optional. This fixes [LOGBACK-300](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-300)
reported by Christian Brensing who also provided the appropriate
pull request.

Logback will now correctly parse variables with a default
separator string nested within accolades, e.g. "{a:-b}". Such
strings resemble variable references but lack the $ prefix, e.g
"${a:-b}". This fixes [LOGBACK-859](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-859)
reported by Yoni Moses.

In `InterpretationContext` class replaced code using
JDK 1.6 API with code using JDK 1.5. This fixes [LOGBACK-860](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-860)
reported by Bas Stoker.

Updated the "org.fusesource.​jansi:jansi" dependency to version
1.9.

---

### 2013-04-26 Release of version 1.0.12

A new `SSLSocketAppender` extends the basic
`SocketAppender` providing the ability to deliver
logging events over the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). The
corresponding `SimpleSSLSocketServer` extends the classic
`SimpleSocketServer` as a basic logging server
application that receives logging events from a
`SSLSocketAppender`.

Receiver components are configured in
logback.xml just like any other logback component.

While `SimpleSocketServer` (and its new SSL-enabled
counterpart, `SimpleSSLSocketServer`) provide an
easy-to-use standalone logging server application, a new component
type known as a *receiver* allows *any* application
to receive logging events from remote appenders over a TCP/IP network
connection, using Logback Classic. Receiver components are
configured in *logback.xml* just like any other logback
component.

A receiver can either listen passively for connections from
remote `SocketAppender` components acting as clients,
or it can assume the client role, initiating a connection to a
remote appender acting as a server. The receiver components
shipped with Logback include full support for logging event
delivery over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

All of the new socket-based receiver and appender components were
contributed by Carl Harris. See
[Receivers](manual/receivers.html) in the Logback Manual
for more information on configuring receiver components. See
[SocketAppender](manual/appenders.html#SocketAppender) and
[ServerSocketAppender](manual/appenders.html#serverSocketAppender)
for information on configuring appenders as event sources for
receiver components.

`RollingFileAppender` will now detect when file property collides with fileNamePattern, emit [an error message](codes.html#rfa_collision) and refuse to
initialize. This was requested in [LOGBACK-796](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-796) by
Karl Pietrzak who also provided a patch.

In configuration files, the `<include>` element
now admits the optional attribute. This
fixes [LOGBACK-230](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-230)
reported by Attila Kiraly. Many thanks to Tommy Becker who
contributed a patch.

In response to [LOGBACK-829](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-829),
serialization of `Logger` instances has been
significantly simplified and much unnecessary bloat removed. As an
added bonus, the new serialization of `Logger` objects
is also compatible with serialization streams using older Logger
instances. `Logger` instances serialized by logback
1.0.11 and earlier can be read by logback version 1.0.12 and later
and *vice-versa*.

The code detecting whether Groovy is available on the class
path deals with the case where logback binaries are installed as
endorsed libraries. This fixes [LOGBACK-831](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-831).

Groovy configurator no longer supports
`SiftingAppender`.

In response to [LOGBACK-244](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-244), [LOGBACK-724](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-724) and
in particular patches provided by Tommy Becker and David Roussel
component tracking code has been simplified and completely
re-written. `SiftingAppender` now supports the [timeout](manual/appenders.html#siftTimeout) and [maxAppenderCount](manual/appenders.html#siftMaxAppenderCount)
parameters. As a direct consequence of modifications to component
tracking code, the groovy configurator no longer supports
`SiftingAppender`.

SiftingAppender now propagates properties defined elsewhere in
the configuration file into the configuration process of nested
appenders. This fixes [LOGBACK-833](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-833) with
David Roussel providing the appropriate patch.

As all other actions affecting properties,
`TimestampAction` now inserts the user-specified
property into the local scope by default. The property was
inserted into the context scope in earlier versions of logback.
This fixes [LOGBACK-835](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-835) with
David Roussel providing the appropriate patch.

Logback is now able to retrieve the name of localhost when
running under OS X and Java 7. This issue was reported by [LOGBACK-749](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-749) by
Oliver Schrenk with patches provided by Ralph Goers and Pavel
Valodzka.

The [mdc](manual/layouts.html#mdc) converter can now
handle default values. This feature was requested in [LOGBACK-246](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-246) by
Michael Osipov with Denis Bazhenov providing a patch.

`DBAppender` in logback-classic module no longer
assumes that caller information is always available. This fixes [LOGBACK-805](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-805)
reported by Daris Cooper who also provided a corrective patch.

In order to simplify our build, several unit tests have been
ported from Scala to Java. It follows that logback no longer
depends on Scala, not even during the test phase of the build.

### 2013-03-25 Release of version 1.0.11

Under Unix\*, the basic/quick file rename method supplied by
Java does not work if the source and target files are on different
file systems. This problem was reported in [LOGBACK-108](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-108) by
Daniel Potter. In order to deal with this issue, logback now will
perform rename by copying if the source and target files are on
different file systems and the host JDK is version 1.7 or
later. See also the related [error code](codes.html#renamingError).

The "cn" conversion word now correctly maps to
`ContextNameConverter` class. This fixes [LOGBACK-463](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-463)
reported by Michael Osipov with Mark A. Ziesemer providing the
appropriate patch.

Added gray to the list of [ANSI colors supported by
logback](manual/layouts.html#coloring). The relevant pull request was kindly provided by
Craig P. Motlin.

The `discoverConnectionProperties(​)` method in class
`ConnectionSourceBase` no longer leaks
connections. This fixes [LOGBACK-798](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-798)
reported by Sayevskiy Viacheslav. Many thanks to Ivan
(Wee-Willie-Winkie) who contributed the appropriate fix.

In logback-access, more correct determination of whether
contents of an `HttpServletRequest` are URL encoded or
not. The [bug
fix](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/pull/71) was submitted by David Schneider. The same issue was later
independently reported by Grzegorz Kuligowski in [LOGBACK-814](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-814).

Both `SocketAppenderBase` and
`SimpleSocketServer` now use a socket factory to create
sockets. These changes were asked in [LOGBACK-815](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-815) and
[LOGBACK-816](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-816) by
Carl Harris who also contributed the relevant patch.

### 2013-03-15 Release of version 1.0.10

Upgraded the (optional) groovy dependency to version 2.0.7
(from 2.0.0).

The logger cache field in `LoggerContext` now uses a
`ConcurrentHashMap` instead of a regular
`HashMap`. This dramatically improves the speed of
logger retrieval and incidentally fixes [LOGBACK-142](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-142).

In `SyslogAppender` allow [suffixPattern](manual/appenders.html#syslogSuffixPattern)
to begin with literal text. This issue was reported Bruno Polaco
in [LOGBACK-782](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-782)
who also provided the relevant patch.

In order to reduce unnecessary boilerplate several common types
and packages are now [imported
automatically](manual/groovy.html#AutomaticImports). This feature was contributed by Joris
Kuipers.

Computation of caller information now takes into account Groovy
frames (if running under Groovy). This fixes [LOGBACK-811](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-811).

---

### 2012-12-05 Release of version 1.0.9

Removed an erroneous compile-time dependency on Tomcat in the
logback-classic module. This issue was reported by Arnaud
Heritier.

---

### 2012-12-04 Release of version 1.0.8

#### logback-classic updated to use SLF4J version 1.7.2 instead of version 1.6.6.

The logback-classic module now uses SLF4J version 1.7.2
instead of version 1.6.6. This only impacts projects running
under an OSGi platform as SLF4J versions 1.7.x and 1.6.x are
100% binary compatible.

Fixed incorrect `BufferStream` assignment after
recovery in `ResilientFileOutputStream`. This issue was
reported in [LOGBACK-765](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-765) by
David Markwick.

Fixed incorrect parsing of variables in case of colon character
followed by a dollar character. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-744](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-744).

`SyslogAppender` now sends out the header line of
stack traces. This issue was reported [LOGBACK-411](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-411) and
separately as [LOGBACK-750](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-750).

A `StatusListener` implementing
`LifeCycle` interface was not started if specified via
the `logback.statusListenerClass` system property. This
issue was reported in [LOGBACK-767](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-767) by
Adam Sokowicz.

In order to avoid duplication, automatic status printing will
be disabled if the user explicitly registers a status
listener.

Added `OnErrorConsoleStatusListener` to print status
messages on the error console, i.e. on System.err. This feature
was requested in [LOGBACK-292](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-292) by
Abraham Lin.

Added `NopStatusListener` class which simply drops
incoming status messages. By [explicitly
registering](manual/configuration.html#logback.statusLC) a `NopStatusListener` listener,
automatic status printing can be turned off.

---

### 2012-08-24 Release of version 1.0.7

#### Janino library upgraded to version 2.6.1.

As of Janino version 2.6.0, in addition to
*janino.jar*, *commons-compiler.jar* needs to be
on the class path as well. Please see the [Janino setup](setup.html#janino) instructions.

#### Groovy dependency upgraded to version 2.0.0.

Please see the [Groovy setup](setup.html#groovy)
instructions.

The code handling variable substitution has been completely
re-written. As requested in [LOGBACK-729](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-729),
variables can be now be nested arbitrarily, even within the
default value section. For example,
`${a${b:-c}:-${d:-e}}` is now a valid logback variable
expression yielding "e", assuming variables with the keys 'd', 'b'
and 'ac' are undefined. The new variable substitution code is
designed to be backward compatible with existing configuration
files.

Substitution properties are now correctly recognized by scan and scanPeriod
attributes of `<configuration>` element in
configuration files. This fixes [LOGBACK-396](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-396)
reported by Oh Chin Boon

The color-related conversion words now set the default color
correctly. Xu Huisheng provided the relavant patch.

Fixed a race-condition in `AsyncAppender` and its
worker thread. This issue was reported in [LOGBACK-720](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-720) by
Arnd Hannemann who also supplied the relevant patch.

If a `PropertyDefiner` implements
`LifeCycle`, then its `start()` method will
now be invoked.

Added the includeCallerData property
in `[SMTPAppender](manual/appenders.html#smtpIncludeCallerData)`
to precompute caller data before storing events for future
transmission. This property addresses [LOGBACK-734](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-734)
reported by Patrick Hogarty.

---

### 7th of June, 2012 Release of version 1.0.6

[`SMTPAppender`](manual/appenders.html#SMTPAppender)
now supports the retrieval of a `javax.mail.Session`
resource from JNDI. This feature was requested in [LBCLASSIC-332](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-332)
by Hrotko Gabor.

Listeners passed to `statusListener()` method in
`GafferConfigurator` (the groovy configurator) are now
correctly started.

---

### 2012-06-06 Release of version 1.0.5

[`ConsoleAppender`](manual/appenders.html#ConsoleAppender)
can now activate the [Jansi
library](http://jansi.fusesource.org) for ANSI color code support on Windows
systems. Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X
already support ANSI color codes by default.

`PatternLayout` now supports [composite conversion
specifiers for coloring](manual/layouts.html#coloring).

---

### 2012-05-31 Release of version 1.0.4

Added `AsyncAppender` for asynchronous invocation of
nested appenders. This was a long-standing and popular request as
attested by [LBCLASSIC-177](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-177),
[LBCORE-92](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-92) and [LBCLASSIC-242](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-242).

`SMTPAppender` now admits the asynchronousSending property, set to 'true' by
default. However, it can be set to 'false' for synchronous email
transmission. This property was requested in [LBCLASSIC-323](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-323)
by Patrick Houk.

It is now possible to set a system property called ["logback.debug"](manual/configuration.html#automaticStatusPrinting)
in order to force printing of internal status messages on the
console regardless of the value of the debug attribute found within the
`<configuration>` element. This behavior was
requested in [LBCLASSIC-225](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-225)
by Aaron Digulla with the relevant patch kindly provided by Antony
Stubbs.

`MarkerFilter` now correctly recognizes nested
markers. This issue was reported in [LBCLASSIC-295](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-295)
by Paolo Mazzoncini who also provided the relevant patch.

Fixed invalid multiple configuration warning when deployed
under Weblogic. This issue was reported in [LBCLASSIC-159](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-159)
by Hontvári József and with the appropriate patch
provided by Derek Mahar.

[`SyslogAppender`](manual/appenders.html#SyslogAppender)
now admits the throwableExcluded
property allowing the exclusion of throwable data if so
desired. This solves [LBCLASSIC-327](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-327)
reported by Don Faulkner.

[`SyslogAppender`](manual/appenders.html#SyslogAppender)
now admits the stackTracePattern
property allowing the customization of the string appearing just
before each stack trace line. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-333](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-333)
reported by Ingebrigt Berg who also provided the relavant patch.

`DBAppender` now supports SQLite. This feature was
requested in [LBGENERAL-53](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-53) by
Tony Trinh who also provided the relevant patch.

### 2012-05-04 Release of version 1.0.3

`PatternLayoutEncoder` class now admits the [immediateFlush](manual/encoders.html#LayoutWrappingEncoder)
property (set to true by default). By setting this property to
'false', logging throughput can be quintupled, although your
mileage may vary. This enhancement was requested in [LBCORE-243](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-243).

In order to facilitate parsing of log files, logback can now [output the
pattern](manual/encoders.html#outputPatternAsHeader) used for the log output at the top of log files as a
header. This feature was requested by James Strachan in [LBCORE-234](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-234).

`SMTPAppender` failed to transmit messages under JDK
1.5. After some investigation, Dave discovered that this was due to
setting the `corePoolSize` parameter of the relevant
`ThreadPoolExecutor` to 0. Setting
`corePoolSize` to a higher value, e.g. 1, under JDK 1.5
solves the problem and fixes [LBCLASSIC-323](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-323)
reported by Lutz Huehnken.

`LevelChangePropagator` now retains references to
j.u.l. loggers whose level it sets. This fixes garbage collection
issues reported in [LBCLASSIC-256](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-256)
by Samuel Stanojevic who also provided the appropriate patch.

### 2012-04-26 Release of version 1.0.2

#### Breaking change partially reverted in 1.0.3By default `PatternLayout` will now output its pattern at the top of log files

This feature, although still available, is no longer enabled by
default. See release notes for version 1.0.3 for details.

`ReconfigureOnChangeFilter` will avoid excessive
synchronization in case of CPU intensive applications. This fixes
[LBCLASSIC-234](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-234),
a recalcitrant bug reported by Uri Unger who also provided the key
steps for reproducing it.

`RollingFileAppender` now creates missing
directories for compressed archive files. This fixes [LBCORE-169](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-169)
reported by Tomasz Nurkiewicz with patches supplied by Paulo
Andrade and Mats Henrikson.

`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` will now remove files with
indexes higher than 99. It will also correctly compute the highest
index value when an application is restarted. This fixes bug [LBCORE-221](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-221)
reported by Dieter Mueller and Dawid Chodura.

---

### 2012-03-07 Release of version 1.0.1

Setting the debug attribute to true in the
`<configuration>` element now registers a
`OnConsoleStatusListener` with the
`StatusManager`. Thus, problems occurring during the
lifetime of your application, well after logback is initialized,
can be reported when the debug attribute
is set. This behavior is closer to what users expect.

Added new property the cleanHistoryOnStart to [TimeBasedRollingPolicy](manual/appenders.html#TimeBasedRollingPolicy).
By setting this property to `true`, history removal
will work as expected even in the case of short-lived
applications. This fixes [LBCORE-226](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-226)
reported by Bruce E. Irving.

It is now possible to specify multiple %d tokens in the file
name pattern of [TimeBasedRollingPolicy](manual/appenders.html#TimeBasedRollingPolicy). Auxiliary
%d tokens must be marked as such by passing the AUX
parameter. This feature was requested in [LBCORE-242](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-242) by
Thomas Corte.

Logback now supports suppressed exceptions introduced in Java
7. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-276](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-276).

`SMTPAppender` clears the relevant cyclic buffer
before asynchronous transmission. This corrects [LBCLASSIC-221](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-221)
as reported by Chris Cheshire.

`SiftingAppender` will consider stale and
consequently remove nested appenders which are closed or
improperly started. This caters for the use case described in [LBCLASSIC-316](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-316)
by Guus Bloemsma.

`RequestLogImpl` can now lookup for the
logback-access configuration file as a class path resource. This
feature was requested in [LBACCESS-26](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-26) by
Marshall Pierce.

Updated the Janino dependency to version 2.5.16. In addition,
the code checking for the availability of Janino on the class path
was updated to take Janino 2.6 into account, thus fixing [LBCORE-210](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-210).

---

### 2011-11-01 Release of version 1.0.0

The logback-access module now targets Tomcat 7.x and Jetty 7.x
& 8.x as its servlet container platforms. This fixes [LBACCESS-17](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-17)
reported by Grzegorz Grzybek.

#### Breaking change: properties are no longer automatically inserted into the context

Properties now have a scope. Previously, the definition of a
property added it to the context. As of version 1.0, properties
are local, i.e. transient by default. For further details, please
refer to the [documentation
on properties](manual/configuration.html#variableSubstitution).

Environment variables are now looked up during property
substitution. This feature was requested in [LBCORE-212](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-212) by
Alexandre Garnier.

`SMTPAppender` now sends emails asynchronously.

Investigation of [LBCORE-224](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-224)
reported by Cesar Alvarez Nunez points to bug in the JVM rather
than in logback. A workaround has been found by using
`CopyOnWriteArrayList` instead of the apparently buggy
`ReadWriteLock`.

In STARTTLS mode, "mail.smtp.auth" property is no longer set
automatically. This fixes [LBCORE-225](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-225)
reported by Mark Woon.

Logback-access now supports conditional configuration. This
fixes [LBACCESS-27](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-27)
reported by Marshall Pierce.

Logback-access now supports inclusion of configuration
files. See the [chapter about
configuration](manual/configuration.html#fileInclusion) in the logback's online manual for more
information.

Added `ch.qos.logback.core.read` to "Import-Package"
declaration in logback-classic's manifest file. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-131](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-131)
reported by Michal Prihoda and Thomas Jaeckle.

Fixed infinitely recursive calls in
`AccessConverter#addError` methods as reported in [LBACCESS-25](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-25) by
Pierre Queinnec.

Fixed incorrect switch fallthrough while selecting between the
H2 and HSQL dialects as reported in [LBCORE-218](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-218) by
Pierre Queinnec.

### 2011-09-21 Release of version 0.9.30

Archive removal can now deal with prolonged periods of
application inactivity and application stop and restarts. The
issue is described in [LBCORE-147](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-147)
reported by Rafael Diaz Maurin.

Logback-classic now supports printing stack traces "root cause
first" instead of the standard "root cause last". See the
documentation for [%rootException](manual/layouts.html#rootException)
converter for further details. The `%rootException`
converter was contributed by Tomasz Nurkiewicz in relation with [LBCLASSIC-217](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-217).

In the `ILoggingEvent` interface the
`getMDC` method is now deprecated and replaced by
`getMDCPropertyMap`. The latter method was already part
of the `ILoggingEvent` interface in prior versions of
logback-classic. Furthermore, the value returned by
`ILoggingEvent.getMDCPropertyMap` can now be an empty
map but never null.

`LoggingEvent` no longer assumes that
`LogbackMDCAdapter` is the only possible implementation
of the `MDCAdapter` interface. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-275](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-275)
reported by Chris Dolan.

`LogbackMDCAdapter` now synchronizes over its thread
local map. This prevents
`ConcurrentModificationException` from occurring while a
child thread copies the map from the parent. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-289](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-289)
reported by Josh Oddman.

It is now possible to specify multiple destination addresses
separated by commas in the the to
property of `SMTPAppender`. This fixes [LBCORE-213](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-213)
reported by Alexandre Garnier who also provided the relevant
patch. In previous versions of logback multiple destination
addresses could only be specified by using multiple to properties. As of version 0.9.30 both
comma separated addresses and multiple to properties are supported.

When debug attribute is set to true within the
`<configuration>` element, status messages are
printed on the console after Joran (re)configures
logback. Previously, all status messages were printed. With this
release, only status messages created during (re)configuration are
printed. This change fixes [LBCLASSIC-273](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-273)
reported by Joern Huxhorn.

Single quotes within a date conversion specifier in filename
patterns are now handled correctly. This fixes [LBCORE-214](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-214)
reported by Derek Libby.

---

### 2011-06-09 Release of version 0.9.29

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-254](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-254),
a performance issue in `LogbackMDCAdapter` as reported
by Michael Franz.

Given that events reference a snapshot of the current MDC map,
the snapshot should not be cleared upon invocation of the
MDC.clear operation. This issue was reported in [LBCLASSIC-253](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-253)
by Tommy Becker and independently fixed by the changes designated
to fix LBCLASSIC-254.

As reported by Deepak Vadgama in [LBCORE-199](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-199), the
entry in every zip file created by
`FixedWindowRollingPolicy` had the same name. The issue
was solved by adding a timestamp to the name of the entry in the
zip files as suggested by a Benoit Xhenseval.

`ConfigurationWatchList` no longer emits an error
message when it encounters a configuration file placed in a jar
file, fixing [LBCLASSIC-246](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-246)
as reported by Joern Huxhorn. This release also fixes [LBCLASSIC-247](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-247)
reported by Michael Franz.

Logback now emits a clearer error message in case a conversion
pattern misses a closing parenthesis or if an opening
parenthesis is misplaced. This fixes [LBCORE-193](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-193)
reported by B. K. Oxley.

Fixed thread safety issue in LRUMessageCache reported in [LBCLASSIC-255](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-255)
by César Álvarez Núñez.

The AccessEvent class in logback-access module now implements
the `IAccessEvent` interface. This fixes [LBACCESS-12](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-12)
reported by Joern Huxhorn.

---

### January 25th, 2011 Release of version 0.9.28

#### Breaking change: In the Context interface, the previously misspelled property `bithTime` is now renamed as `birthTime`.

In the [Context](apidocs/ch/qos/logback/core/Context.html)
interface, the previously misspelled property
`bithTime` is now renamed as
`birthTime`. This is a backward-incompatible
change. All pre-existing references to "bithTime" property now
need to referenced as "birthTime".

Fixed [issue
238](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-238) reported by Robert Elliot. `GEventEvaluator`'s
start method now correctly sets the state of the instance.

`JaninoEventEvaluator` now expects Java blocks
instead of boolean expressions. For even moderately complex
logical statements, blocks can be more convenient to read or to
write compared with boolean expressions. To ensure backward
compatibility, existing boolean expressions are converted into
blocks on the fly.

Corrected handling of null valued arguments by DBAppender. This
fixes [LBCLASSIC-239](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-239)
reported by Artyom Kalita.

It is now possible to use the context birth time as the time
reference for the [`<timestamp>`](manual/appenders.html#uniquelyNamed)
element in configuration files.

Logback can now scan for included files as well. This solves [LBCLASSIC-245](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-245).

---

### December 22nd, 2010 Release of version 0.9.27

Added a new section in the documentation about [real-world inspired recipes](recipes/index.html).

`PatternLayout` now supports compound conversion
words of which ["%replace"](manual/layouts.html#replace) is one
example. This change involved a significant re-write of the
pattern tokenizer, the pattern parser and the pattern
compiler. However, the changes should be backward compatible as far
as users are concerned.

The [to](manual/appenders.html#smtpTo) option of SMTPAppender now admits a
pattern and is evaluated dynamically.

`TeeServletInputStream` no longer chokes on input
over 8K in size. This fixes [LBACCESS-10](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-10) as
reported by Augusto Rodriguez.

`TeeFilter` now takes include and exclude parameters
so that it can be enabled or disabled by host. This solves [LBACCESS-15](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBACCESS-15).

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-231](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-231)
as reported by Jeff Skjonsby. When configuring
`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP`,
`GaggerConfigurator` (Groovy) will no longer throw a
`NullPointerException`.

Every context now returns its own name when asked for the
property `CONTEXT_NAME`. This fixes [LBCORE-178](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-178) as
requested by Michael Osipov.

### 20th of October, 2010 Release of version 0.9.26

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-183](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-183)
as reported by Anthony Whitford. Upon application restart, Tomcat
should no longer complain about ThreadLocal variables created
internally by logback.

`SMPTAppender` now lets users set a custom buffer
size for the outgoing messages. This fixes [LBCORE-170](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-170) as
requested by Peter Royal.

When stopped, `RollingFileAppender` now calls
`stop()` on its policy objects, fixing [LBCORE-114](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-114)
reported by Anders Wallgren.

Added mapping for OFF and ALL levels in `JULHelper`
as requested in [LBCLASSIC-226](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-226)
by Christian Brensing.

### October 13th, 2010 Release of version 0.9.25

Logback-classic now supports [propagation
of level changes from logback-classic onto the
j.u.l. framework](manual/configuration.html#LevelChangePropagator). This significantly reduces the performance
impact of disabled log statements making it reasonable for
real-world applications to use the [jul-to-slf4j
bridge](http://slf4j.org/legacy.html#jul-to-slf4j).

The `<appender-ref>` element now supports
[variable substitution](manual/configuration.html#variableSubstitution), thus fixing [LBCLASSIC-224](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-224)
as reported by David Harrigan.

As reported in [LBCORE-164](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-164),
`SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` would cause previous logging
files with indexes over nine to be overwritten on application
restart. This complex bug was reported and precisely diagnosed by
Dieter Mueller. He has also proposed a fix which was subsequently
adopted as is.

---

### June 30th, 2010 Release of version 0.9.24

Fixed NullPointerException thrown by
`MDCBasedDiscriminator` in case the MDC map is
null.

Fixed issue with `SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP` in presence
of application stop/restart and non-null file property. This issue
was reported by Tom Liu in [LBCORE-131](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-131).

---

### June 29th, 2010 Release of version 0.9.23

Fixed Groovy runtime dependency problem with
ReconfigureOnChangeFilter, i.e. the auto-scan filter, when using
non-groovy configuration files. This problem was reported in [LBCLASSIC-214](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-214)
by Alvin Chee.

Fixed `MDCBasedDiscriminator` so that it supports deferred
processing. This issue was reported in [LBCLASSIC-213](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-213)
by Torsten Juergeleit.

---

### June 21st, 2010 Release of version 0.9.22

Logback now supports [configuration
files written in Groovy](manual/groovy.html) which are more convenient than
configuration files written in XML. We have also developed a tool
to [automatically
migrate your logback.xml files to logback.groovy](http://logback.qos.ch/translator/asGroovy.html).

Inspired by the functionality offered by
`SiftingAppender`, `SMTPAppender` now can
[track multiple
buffers according to selection information returned by a
discriminator](manual/appenders.html#smtpDiscriminator).

Fixed synchronization issue in `ConsoleAppender` as
reported in [LBCORE-158](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-158) by
David Roussel who also supplied a corrective patch.

---

### May 8th, 2010 Release of version 0.9.21

SLF4J dependency upgraded to 1.6.0

Fixed concurrency problem in `SiftingAppender` as
reported in [LBCLASSIC-203](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-203)
by Ellen Strnod.

Added [GEventEvaluator](manual/filters.html#GEventEvaluator)
which processes boolean expression written in the Groovy language.

Fixed rollover problem occurring when the target directory was
missing as reported in [LBCORE-151](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-151) by
Torsten Juergeleit. A closely related problem was reported in [LBCLASSIC-167](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-167)
by Rick Janda.

---

### April 2nd, 2010 Release of version 0.9.20

Fixed issue related to charsets in
`LayoutWrappingEncoder` not being recognized in config
files.

Logback now supports [conditional
processing](manual/configuration.html#conditional) of configuration files.

A new extension point for [defining
properties on the fly](manual/configuration.html#definingPropsOnTheFly) has been added. The code for this
enhancement was provided by Aleksey Didik in [LBCLASSIC-182](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-182).

Logback now provides [an
answer](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/loggingSeparation.html) to the longstanding logging separation problem for
static logger references in shared libraries. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-166](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-166)
and [LBCLASSIC-87](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-87).

Removed the previously deprecated `getFirstFilter`
method in `FilterAttachable` interface.

### March 24, 2010 Release of version 0.9.19

#### Breaking change: FileAppender now expects an Encoder

In response to [LBCORE-128](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-128),
`WriterAppender` has been renamed as
`OutputStreamAppender`, `FileAppender` now
subclassing the latter. `OutputStreamAppender` and
subclasses now take an `Encoder` instead of a
`Layout`.

Contrary to layouts which simply transform a logging event into
a String, an encoder is responsible for writing the actual event
or more accurately the representation of the event onto the output
stream. The role of the enclosing appender is now limited to
managing the output stream (opening/closing) but not writing
actual contents onto the stream. This change will require  [modifications to
existing configuration files](codes.html#layoutInsteadOfEncoder). We hope to make up for this
inconvenience with cool new features which are only possible using
encoders. **During a transition period, layouts passed as
parameter will be automatically wrapped by an encoder so that
configuration files in the old format (using a layout instead of
encoder) will continue to work unmodified.**

#### Breaking change: DBAppender in logback-classic expects four additional columns

Instead of lumping log request arguments into a field,
`DBAppender` (in logback-classic) now outputs up to
four arguments in the logging request in separate columns, named
`arg0`, `arg1`, `arg2` and
`arg4`. This solves [LBCLASSIC-187](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-187)
reported by Greg Thomas.

Existing databases can be migrated to the new table structure
by altering the existing tables. Here is how it would be done
in PostgreSQL and MySQL.

```
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD COLUMN arg0 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD COLUMN arg1 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD COLUMN arg2 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD COLUMN arg3 VARCHAR(254);
```

In Oracle:

```
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD arg0 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD arg1 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD arg2 VARCHAR(254);
ALTER TABLE logging_event ADD arg3 VARCHAR(254);
```

`FileAppender` and derived classes can now
gracefully deal with IO failures and recover quickly after the
original cause of the IO failure is corrected. For example, if the
log file is located on a [network-attached
storage (NAS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage), and the connection to the NAS server is lost,
`FileAppender` and derived classes will recover quickly
after the connection to the server is re-established.

The packages under `ch.qos.logback.classic`
namespace no longer depend on `org.slf4j.impl`. This
fixes [LBCLASSIC-184](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-184)
reported by Gunnar Wagenknecht.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-193](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-193).
`SyslogAppender` will no longer shutdown when messages
over 256Kb cause an `IOException`.

Added [OnMarkerEvaluator](manual/appenders.html#OnMarkerEvaluator)
which evaluates to true in the presence of user-specified
markers. When used with `SMTPAppender`, it can trigger
an outgoing email message when an event matches user-specified
marker.

Request header names in AccessEvent (logback-access) are now
stored in a case-insensitive way as specified in RFC 2616. This
prevents compatibility issues, in particular with recent versions
of Tomcat which store request header names in lower-case.

Fixed [LBCORE-134](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-134)
reported by Michael Franz. While reading configuration files (in
XML), the event handler will correctly process body text, in
particular spaces, even when delivered in multiple chunks. The
previous behavior of trimming leading and trailing white space has
been preserved. Moreover, body text consisting of white space
surrounding child elements is ignored.

`SiftingAppender` now exposes its
`AppenderTracker`. Moreover, the
`stopAndRemoveNow(String key)` method was added to
`AppenderTracker`, allowing immediate removal of a
nested appender.

Fixed [LBCORE-130](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-130).
`FileNamePattern` no longer treats parenthesis as
special.

The CharsetEncoder property in
`SMTPAppender` can now be accessed and set from
configuration files. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-194](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-194).

Instead of sending its output to the System.out/err reference
that was effective at initialization, `ConsoleAppender`
will now seek the most current System.out/err reference and send
its output there. This fixes [LBCORE-143](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-143) as
reported by Tom SH Liu.

DBAppender now outputs exception class and message. It will
also output root causes, fixing
[LBCLASSIC-170](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-170)
reported by Tomasz Nurkiewicz.

You can now override table and column names in DBAppender. This
feature was requested in [LBCLASSIC-188](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-188)
reported by Tomasz Nurkiewicz.

Fixed missing EVENT\_ID column problem on PostgreSQL as reported
in [LBCORE-126](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-126)
by Brian Edwards.

Event id values in DBAppender are now 64bit instead of 32. This
change was requested in [LBCLASSIC-198](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-198)
by Michael Lynch.

Added Sybase SQLAnywhere support in DBAppender. This feature
was requested by Michael Lynch in [LBCLASSIC-197](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-197).

Added H2 support in DBAppender.

Fixed [LBSITE-36](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBSITE-36) reported
by John Jimenez.

---

### 3rd of December 2009 Release of version 0.9.18

After a very long investigation resulting in somewhat a better
understanding of licensing issues, logback is now [dual-licensed](license.html) under the EPL 1.0 and LGPL
2.1.

Due to a clerical error [LBCORE-26](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-26) has
re-raised its ugly head. It has now been tamed for good.

Fixed Private-Package and Export-Package sections in
logback-classic.jar MANIFEST as reported in [LBCLASSIC-165](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-165)
and [LBCLASSIC-121](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-121)
by applying the relevant patches supplied by Hugues Malphettes.

Made the OSGi import declarations for Janino and javax optional
as proposed by David Varnes in [LBCORE-101](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-101).

`ReconfigureOnChangeFilter` did not pick up changes
for configuration files containing spaces. This issue was reported
in [LBCORE-119](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-119)
by Anders Wallgren.

Added tests cases which run logback artifacts as bundles within
Felix. This should solve a series of problems related to OSGi.

When ill-formed configuration files fragments were included in
another configuration file, the included file was not closed
correctly. This issue was reported in [LBCORE-122](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-122) by
Michael Franz.

JaninoEventEvaluator now passes the throwable associated with
an event as a `java.lang.Throwable` instead of an
`IThrowableProxy`. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-155](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-155)
as reported by Hontvári József. See [EvaluatorFilter
documentation](manual/filters.html#evaluatorFilter) for more details.

The name of the log file nested within .zip archives was
incorrectly set to be that of the tmp file logback creates during
compression. Anders Wallgren reported and posted an appropriate
patch for this problem in [LBCORE-98](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-98). The
nested file is now named after the zip archive file. Analysis
showed that this was an appropriate strategy in all the cases we
considered.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-149](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-149). The
ContextNameConverter now correctly uses the context name of the
event instead of its own context name.

When a logger is named after an inner class, the '$' is used as
a separator, instead of the usual '.'. This fixes the level
inheritance issue described in [LBCLASSIC-102](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-102)
and as reported by Joern Huxhorn.

Fixed deadlock issue observed with appender which invoke
loggers as reported in [LBCLASSIC-154](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-154)
by Andrew Perrine and debugged by Ralph Goers who also proposed
the relevant patch.

---

### 9th of August 2009 Release of version 0.9.17

`PackagingDataCalculator` now correctly deals with
`NoClassDefFoundError` thrown by class loaders. This
fixes [LBCLASSIC-125](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-125)
reported by Roland Klein and independently by Didier Besset.

In configuration files, all tags names associated with explicit
actions are now case-insensitive. This should diminish
case-related errors users may make when writing configuration
files. Tag names associated with implicit actions which are
closely linked to the actual Java class being configured, still
need to follow the camelCase convention. If you are unsure which
case to use for a given tag name, just follow the camelCase
convention for tag names which should be correct in most
cases.

It is now possible to create [uniquely named files by
timestamp](manual/appenders.html#uniquelyNamed). Such files are appropriate for log files associated
with batch applications. This enhancement fulfills [LBCORE-91](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-91) as
requested by Rick Beton and Szel Zoltan.

Append mode is now mandatory in
`RollingFileAppender`. This was already the default and
truncation mode is unreasonable in most cases. For example, in
truncate mode when an application stops and is quickly re-started,
any pre-existing log file for the current period will be lost.

The `activeFile` field in
`RollingFileAppender` is now properly updated, fixing
[LBCORE-90](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-90) as
reported by Valery Shorin.

The `TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy` has been heavily
refactored. It is now possible to trigger rolling simultaneously
by [time and
by size](manual/appenders.html#SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP), fixing [LBCORE-61](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-61).

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-145](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-145)
reported by Joern Huxhorn. The `LoggingEventVO` class
now correctly populates its callerData field if the original
`ILoggingEvent` already has it.

---

### 15th of July 2009 Release of version 0.9.16

In addition to nifty new features, this release contains
several important internal changes. Given the importance of some
of those internal changes, *this release may be less stable
than previous logback releases*.

In logback-classic, [`LoggingEvent`](xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/LoggingEvent.html)
now implements the [`ILoggingEvent`](xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/ILoggingEvent.html)
interface. All logback-classic components expect to process
`ILoggingEvent` instances. Moreover, events which sent
to a remote host are now of type [`LoggingEventVO`](xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/LoggingEventVO.html).

Logback-classic will now [automatically
re-configure itself](manual/configuration.html#autoScan) when its configuration file is
modified. This enhancement was requested in [LBCORE-59](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-59) by
Michael Osipov.

FileAppender and its derived class RollingFileAppender are now
based on a finer-grain synchronization model. This change is aimed
at reducing various synchronization related bugs, namely [LBCLASSIC-135](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-135)
and its various sub-tasks.

Fixed a bug in the localLevelReset() method in the
`Logger` class which inadvertently used the DEBUG\_INT
value in the org.slf4j.spi.LocationAwareLogger interface instead
of the DEBUG\_INT value in ch.qos.logback.classic.​Level class. The
issue was first identified by Andy Ruch [in
a message](http://qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2009-February/000955.html) to the logback-user list

If the logger name had 12 or more segments, the logger
conversion specified would throw an
`ArrayIndexOfBounds` exception. Lukas Zapletal has
kindly reported this problem in [LBCLASSIC-110](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-110)
and provided a test case.

A new discriminator class called "ContextBasedDiscriminator"
allows SiftingAppender to separate logging based on the context
name. This fits nicely with the requirements expressed in [LBCLASSIC-117](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-117)
by Rick Janda.

When a context is reset, then its object and property maps are
now cleared. This fixes [LBCORE-104](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-104)
reported by Johan Bos.

Fixed [LBCORE-105](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-105). Configuration
files placed in jar files will no longer lock the jar file. This
issue was initially reported for log4j in [bug
47465](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47465) Mark Thomas.

Fixed [LBCORE-94](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-94). While
configuring a RollingFileAppender, if the File property is
declared after any rolling or triggering policies, then logback will
now generate an error status message.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-134](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-134)
reported by Darryl Smith. `DuplicateMessageFilter` will
now behave correctly when invoked via
`Logger.isXXXEnabled` methods.

Fixed [LBCORE-107](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-107),
incorrectly set context information for the
`NestedBasicPropertyIA` instance in Joran, reported by
Lóránt Pintér.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-109](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-109),
reported by Andrew Ruch when a logger context was reset, the trace
level was erroneously enabled.

---

### 12th of February 2009 Release of version 0.9.15

When the reset() method in `LoggerContext` is
called, registered turbo filters are first stopped before being
unregistered. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-89](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-89)
reported by Alexis Morillo.

Added a servlet for viewing internal status messages as an HTML
table. Two separate implementations are available; one for [logback-classic](manual/configuration.html#viewingStatusMessages)
and the other for [logback-access](access.html#viewingStatusMessages).

Added the `clear()` method to the
`StatusManager` interface. After reconfiguration, it
may be desirable to clear the status list maintained by a
`StatusManager`. This change was requested by Alexis
Morillo in [LBCORE-77](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-77).

Fixed problem [LBCLASSIC-104](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-104)
related to loss of MDC information in deferred logging events.

Fixed issue [LBCLASSIC-101](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-101). Logback
jar files now include full OSGi bundle information in their
manifests. This information is automatically added by Apache
Felix' Maven bundle plug-in. The generated manifest files contain
an appropriate Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment directive,
fixing [LBGENERAL-8](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-8).

The setter and getter methods for the layout property in
`AppenderBase` class now have reasonable default
implementations, instead of nop previously. This change was
requested by Thilo Tanner in [LBCORE-56](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-56).

Added *log4j.dtd* compatible [`XMLLayout`](manual/layouts.html#log4jXMLLayout)
as requested in [LBCLASSIC-22](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-22).

New chapter [on Joran](manual/onJoran.html).

---

### 29th of December 2008 Release of version 0.9.14

Corrected a serious deadlock problem occurring during
configuration. It was reported in [LBCLASSIC-81](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-81) by
Holger Mense.

Corrected thread leakage observed with
`TimeBasedRollingPolicy`'s
`AsynchronousCompressor`. This bug was reported in [LBCORE-78](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-78) by Szel
Zoltan.

Added [DuplicateMessageFilter](manual/filters.html#DuplicateMessageFilter),
a turbo filter which detects duplicate messages, and beyond a
certain number of repetitions, drops repeated messages.

Added a new appender called [`SiftingAppender`](manual/appenders.html#SiftingAppender). As
its name intimates, a `SiftingAppender`
can be used to separate (or sift) logging according to a given
runtime attribute. For example, `SiftingAppender` can
separate logging events according to user sessions, so that the
logs generated by each user go into distinct log files, one log
file per user.

`BasicStatusManager`'s internal buffer is now split
into two parts, the header part and the tail part. The header part
stores the fist H status messages whereas the tail part stores the
last T messages. At present time H=T=150, although these values may
change in future releases.

Fixed `NullPointerException` thrown when calling
`setContextMap` on a fresh MDC. [Issue was](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-98)
reported by Francois Terrier.

Evaluators are now wired into an appender automatically
(implicit rules) without the help of
`EvaluatorAction`. EvaluatorAction is now only needed
for global evaluator elements. It follows that name attribute is
necessary only for global evaluators. Embedded evaluators no
longer need a name. This change fixes [LBCLASSIC-100](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-100). In
addition, `EvaluatorAction` has been modified to accept
evaluators of any type and not just instances of
`JaninoEvaluator`.

Logback-classic default configuration process will now
automatically print status data on the console in case of warnings
as well as errors. Previously, status data was printed only in
case of errors.

`ContextInitializer` will now print the url of the
configuration it is using. This should help reduce confusion when
multiple config files are found on the class path. This change
resolves [LBCLASSIC-55](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-55)
reported by Anton Tagunov and Henric Larsson.

In case multiple configuration files are found on the class
path, `ContextInitializer` will now emit a
warning. This fixes [LBCLASSIC-85](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-85)
filed by Szel Zoltan.

`HTMLLayout` now honors custom conversion words,
thus fixing [LBCORE-74](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-74) as
reported by Natan Cox.

Fixed [LBCORE-69](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-69) as
reported by Andrey Rybin. `SMTPAppenderBase` now has
support for charset encodings so that email messages can contain
characters beyond US-ASCII.

`SMTPAppender` in logback-classic now defaults to
`OnErrorEvaluator` instead of a janino-based
evaluator. Thus, by default `SMTPAppender` no longer
depends on Janino.

Added UnsynchronizedAppenderBase class based on Ralph Goers'
contribution in [LBCORE-58](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-58). Note
that `AppenderBase` remains unchanged. Appenders which
need to handle synchronization on their own can do so by deriving
from `UnsynchronizedAppenderBase`.

### 5th of December 2008 Release of version 0.9.13

A `NullPointerException` was being thrown when the
level of a logger was set to null. The logger in question had to
have children. This problem was reported in [LBCLASSIC-91](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-91)
by Mateusz Jedruch.

### 4th of December 2008 Release of version 0.9.12

Fixed [bug
LBCORE-26](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-26) reported by Tsutomu YANO and independently by
Hontvári József and Gamaliel
Amaudruz. `RollingFileAppender` when used in conjunction
with `DateBasedRollingPolicy` will rollover existing log
files at initialization if their timestamp warrants it.

Added support for file appending in [prudent mode](manual/appenders.html#prudent). Thus,
multiple `FileAppender` instances running on multiple
JVMs can safely write to the same log file. With certain
limitations, prudent mode extends to
`RollingFileAppender`.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-83](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-83).
It is now possible to set the level of a logger to null, even if
it was previously set to a non-null level. Previously, a
`NullPointerException` would be thrown.

In response to [LBCLASSIC-61](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-61), [LBCLASSIC-33](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-33), [LBCLASSIC-24](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-14) and
[LBCLASSIC-14](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-24)
`JMXConfigurator` has been redesigned.

Fixed [LBGENERAL-22](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-22). The
[log4j.properties
translator](http://logback.qos.ch/translator/) web-application has been significantly refactored.

Fixed improvement request [LBCLASSIC-59](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-59)
relation to StatusListeners, originally submitted by Anton Tagunov.

The logger and class name converters now consider zero as
having special meaning, and will return the simple class name,
removing the package name prefix. This feature was asked by
Silvano Maffeis.

In response to  [LBCLASSIC-54](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-54)
support for turbo filters has refactored. The present code is safe
under concurrent access while still offering good performance.

Fixed [LBCORE-43](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-43) reported
by Bruno Navert. Configuration files can now look up property
files from classpath resources.

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-86](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-86)
related to `AccessControlException` thrown when run in
a JVM with a `SecurityManager`.

Invoking the `LoggerContext.reset()` method resets
logger levels to their default value, that is `DEBUG`
for the root logger and `null` for all other
loggers. This was requested in [LBCLASSIC-90](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-90) by
Mateusz Jedruch.

Fixed [bug
LBCLASSIC-69](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-69) reported by Anton Tagunov. The
LevelToSyslogSeverity now correctly handles the TRACE level.

Fixed [bug
LBCLASSIC-57](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-57) reported by Anton Tagunov. SyslogAppender could
overwhelm the Syslog server with very large messages. SyslogAppender
now limits its message size to 256K.

Logback now supports [setting the logger context
name](manual/configuration.html#contextName) as well as inserting variables [stored in JNDI](manual/configuration.html#insertFromJNDI) as
properties.

Fixed issue [LBCLASSIC-49](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-49)
reported by Oliver Lietz. The getLogger() method in
`LoggerContext` class will now throw an
`IllegalArgumentException` when invoked with a null
argument.

---

### 28th of October 2008 Release of version 0.9.11

Fixed [LBCLASSIC-77](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-77)
reported independently by Gianni Doe, Yannick Haudry and Yossi Shaul.
The childValue() method of `CopyOnInheritThreadLocal`
class part of MDC code no longer throws a
`NullPointerException`.

---

### 27th of October 2008 Release of version 0.9.10

In case of errors during initialization, logback-classic now
*automatically* prints out its internal status. This has been
a frequently requested feature.

The LogbackValve in logback-access (ensuring integration with
Tomcat), will now systematically print its internal status upon
initialization, unless told to be quiet. This greatly helps
troubleshooting the configuration of logback-access under Tomcat.

Fixed [bug
147](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=147) which occurred when the user inadvertently attempted to set
the layout of a `SyslogAppender`. The code now actively
prevents this. Documentation has been updated to reflect the change.

Fixed [bug
LBCLASSIC-56](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-56) originally reported by Michel Colette. Backslash
characters are now correctly interpreted in filename patterns.

The TurboFilterChain in a LoggerContext is [now
cleared](http://svn.qos.ch/viewvc?view=rev&revision=1678) when the `reset`() method is called. This
problem was reported on May 1st, 2008, by Julia Hu on the logback
developers list.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-48](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-48). During
rollover, compression of large files would bring all logging to a
halt. In this latest release, the rolled over file is first renamed,
which is a relatively fast operation, and only then is the renamed
file compressed asynchronously (in a separate thread).

Fixed issue [LBCORE-11](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-11). It is now
possible to instruct TimeBasedRollingPolicy to delete old files,
thus controlling then number of archived log files.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-42](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-42). If the
parent directory of the log file does not exist, then FileAppender
will create it, including any necessary but nonexistent parent
directories.

Fixed [LBCORE-15](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-15)
reported by Klaus Unger and others. DBAppender should now work with
Oracle 9, 10g and 11g, regardless of the JDBC driver type used.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-17](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-17) reported by
Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen. Logback now relies on Geronimo JMS
API specifications instead of Sun's JMS API specification, the
latter requiring manual installation. With Geronimo JMS, logback can
be built using Maven without needing to manually install any
dependencies.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-23](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-23). In
PatternLayout, parenthesis can be used to group conversion
patterns. It follows that the '(' and ')' carry special meaning and
need to be escaped to be used as literals. This is now properly
documented.

The location of the default configuration file can be specified
by a system property. This feature was requested in [LBCORE-32](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-32) by Ted
Graham, Matt Fowles, Ivan Biddles and Ralph Goers.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-55](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-55) reported by
Natan Cox. `WriterAppender` now outputs its presentation
footer and file footer in the correct order.

Fixed issue [LBCORE-27](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-27) reported by
Peter Royal. `SMTPAppender` now outputs its presentation
footer and file footer in the correct order.

Fixed issue [LBCLASSIC-67](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-67)
reported by Alessandro Fustini. SMTPAppender now correctly
configures the layout used to format the subject line of the
outgoing email. It no longer appends a lengthy stack trace to the
subject line.

Fixed issue [LBCLASSIC-68](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-68)
reported by Gili Tzabari. In environments where the TCCL (Thread
Context Class Loader) was not set, logback was unable to located its
default configuration files. Logback now uses the class loader that
loaded logback itself to locate its resources instead of the
TCCL. This approach is simpler and deemed to cover more
environments, i.e. more widely applicable.

Fixed issue [LBGENERAL-24](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-24)
reported by Hung Tang. SMTPAppender now supports plain
username/password authentication as well as both the STARTTLS
command and SSL connections.

Fixed issue [LBCLASSIC-48](http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-48)
reported by Peter Royal. SyslogAppender now correctly outputs hours
as 0-23 and not as 1-12 as previously.

Added a new TurboFilter called DynamicThresholdFilter which can
filter events depending on MDC values based on a variety of criteria
such as company name, product or the end user. This filter was

### 26th of March 2008 Release of version 0.9.9

MDC data in now inherited by child threads. This behaviour was
already specified in the javadocs. The issue was raised by Martin
Benda in [bug
64](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=64) and independently by Peter Huber.

Logback no longer includes retro-weaver generated jars for JDK
1.4. There seems to be little of interest in JDK 1.4 builds. Calling
retro-weaver increases logback's build time by a few seconds each
time – seconds in which we can do more productive things.

Fixed [bug
104](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=104), silly but nonetheless serious copy-and-paste errors in
the c.q.l.classic.Logger class, reported by Joern Huxhorn.

Having been replaced by `SimpleSocketServer`, the
`SocketServer` class has been removed.

Fixed [bug
105](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=105), sockets created by `SocketAppenderBase` is now
closed, reported by Joern Huxhorn. More generally,
`SimpleSocketServer` is much more careful to track open
client connections and to close them.

Fixed [bug
110](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=110) in relation with the `requestParameterMap` field
in `AccessEvent` - reported by Joern Huxhorn.

Fixed [SLF4J bug 66](http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66) in relation with caller data when using
log4j-over-slf4j - reported by Frnack Routier.

Fixed [bug
129](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=129) reported by Michael Franz. As a result, Joran now supports
nested as well as multiple file inclusions.

Fixed [bug
100](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=100) reported by Joern Huxhorn. At serialization time, object
array passed as parameter, when the LoggingEvent is are now
serialized as strings.

Fixed [bug
109](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=109) reported by Joern Huxhorn. There should no longer be any
NullPointerExceptions thrown by deserialized
`AccessEvent` instances.

Fixed [bug
8](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=8) reported by Sebastien Pennec. The documentation has been
updated to reflect the fact that in the context of conversion
patterns the percent sign carries special meaning, in order to
include the percent sign as a literal, it must be escaped with a
backslash.

Fixed [bug
52](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=52) reported by Kenichi Masuko. The bug has been fixed on March
8th, 2007. Starting with this release, Joran will support the
injection of any enum type, not just `FilterReply`.

---

### 22th of August 2007 Release of version 0.9.8

This version of logback synchronizes with SLF4J version 1.4.3. In
particular, logback now natively supports SLF4J's MDC API introduced
in SLF4J version 1.4.1. If you are using SLF4J version 1.4.1 or
later please make sure upgrade to logback version 0.9.8 or later.

Fixed a number of documentation related bugs, in particular [bug 90](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90) reported
by Luc Maisonobe and [bug 88](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90) reported
by Sebastian Davids.

It is now possible to include configuration file fragments (in
XML) as a resource. Previously, it was only possible to include a
file by specifying a path to a file or a URL. This feature was
requested by Michael Newcomb in [bug 89](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=89).

Fixed caller data extraction problem as reported in [bug 78](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=78) by Hans
van der Meer.

The LoggingEvent class' constructor now correctly takes into
account the argument array passed by the user. This problem was
reported in [bug
85](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=85) by Robert Christian.

---

### 29th of May 2007 Release of version 0.9.7

This release corrects packaging bugs [75](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=75) and [76](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=76) related to
the migration of logback to SLF4J version 1.4.0. There are no other
changes.

---

### 23rd of May 2007 Release of version 0.9.6

Logback is now aligned and compatible with SLF4J version 1.4.0,
thus correcting [bug 73](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=73) as
reported by Andy Gerweck.

Fixed `NoClassDefFoundError` problem when running
under JDK 1.4 [as
reported](http://www.qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2007-April/000206.html) by Brian Suksomwong.

Fixed [bug
63](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=63) as reported by La Canea Rosario. Calling log4j (bridge) with
the trace level will no longer cause an IllegalStateException to be
thrown.

Fixed [bug
70](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=70) as reported by Dirk Ooms. The %throwable conversion word is
now recognized as documented in the logback manual. Moreover, the
manual now mentions the %nopex word which can be used to force
`PatternLayout` to ignore the exception contained in the
logging request.

As in most releases, the documentation has been improved.

---

### April 2nd, 2007 Release of version 0.9.5

Fixed methods `isInfoEnabled`,
`isWarnEnabled` and `isErrorEnabled` methods
in `ch.qos.logback.classic.​Logger` class which failed to
work correctly. This bug was reported today by Pavel Kral on the
slf4j-user list.

Contrary to previous versions of logback, the various
Logger.isXYZEnabled(Marker) methods now take into account the marker
information passed as parameter.

As discussed in [bug 54](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=54), during
automatic initialization, it makes better sense to first check for
*logback-test.xml* file and only if that fails, to check for
*logback.xml*. Maven2 will guarantee that the
logback-test.xml file, if places under test/resources will not be
included in the artifact it produces.

---

### March 29th, 2007 Release of version 0.9.4

Significant bug fixes made to `c.q.l.access.TeeFilter`
and Co. Images and other binary files are now intercepted and
replayed correctly. As for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests,
their input buffer is left untouched. In a best-effort attempt, the
input buffer for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests is later
reconstructed through the request parameters. However, it may differ
from the original buffer.

The logback team released today the first version of a plugin for
Eclipse that allows developers to visualize logs generated by a
running application. It offers several nice features. Please check
the [console plugin-in guide](consolePlugin.html) for
more details.

### March 20th, 2007 Release of version 0.9.3

Includes in configuration files are now supported by Joran,
logback's configuration framework. A file can contain an
*include* element that has a *file* or *url*
attribute pointing to a configuration file. See the [chapter about
configuration](manual/configuration.html#fileInclusion) in the logback's online manual for more
information.

Corrected bug 53 reported by Wilkins Poe. There is now a [dependencies page](dependencies.html) that shows the
requirements of each of logback's modules.

After a [discussion on the SLF4J mailing list](http://www.slf4j.org/pipermail/user/2007-March/000297.html) started by Franck Routier,
a correction has been made when logging using the
*JCL104-over-slf4j* module. Logback now correctly shows the
caller location information.

As in most logback releases, the documentation has been improved.

### March 5th, 2007 Release of version 0.9.2

The documentation is now in the *docs/* directory to allow an
easier access to the logback manual and website for offline viewing.

### March 5th, 2007 Release of version 0.9.1

Logback-class now depends on SLF4J version 1.3.0 instead of
1.2.

Numerous improvements to the documentation.

[Bug #46](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=46)
reported by Mark Renyolds has been fixed. The
`TimeUtilTest` should now run fine under any time
zone.

[Bug
#45](http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=45), also reported by Mark Reynolds, has been fixed. There
should be no `ClassCastException` thrown anymore when
passing an `Object` to the printing methods using the
log4j-bridge module.

---

### January 31st, 2007 Release of version 0.9

This version contains a new component, namely the
`ContextSelector`, that provides context separation and
management when logback is used by several web-apps running under
the same server. A [new
chapter](manual/contextSelector.html) was added to the logback manual to detail the use of the
`ContextSelector`, along with its associated components.

The `JMXConfigurator` has been improved. It now shows
the context's Status objects, which lets users check the internal
state of logback.

The logback manual's chapter 2, about [logback's architecture](manual/architecture.html), has been
updated with two sections: Under the hood and Performance.

---

### January 23th, 2007 Release of version 0.8.1

This version contains new components in the Access module,
allowing users to display the full HttpServletRequest or
HttpServletResponse of an access event.

The documentation section has been updated. The short
introduction was split into the chapter 1 and chapter 2 of the
logback manual. The chapters about Appenders and Layouts have been
updated to document new components of logback.

A demonstration webApp presenting logback's major components is
available. A document explains how to run it, and provides a
step-by-step visit of the demo.

A first translation of logback jars to JDK1.4 is present in
this release.

---

### January 12th, 2007 Release of version 0.8

This version contains a whole new chapter, namely Chapter 3,
about logback configuration. Several other documentation pages
have been improved.

Logback now uses Generics in many components.

Several new components have been added to logback. A JMX
Configurator now allows users to see and modify loggers or reload
configuration among other possibilities. A [document](jmxConfig.html) about this configurator is
available in the [corresponding
section](documentation.html) of the site. We'd like to thank Sebastian Davids for his
ideas and contributions to this component.

A JMSTopicAppender and JMSQueueAppender are now available, as
well as two new filters: LevelFilter and ThresholdFilter. A
refactoring was done in the filters objects to ease the
implementation of custom filters.

---

### December 19th, 2006 Release of version 0.7.1

Version 0.7.1 of logback has been released.

This version contains more detailed information about logback
access module, and its JMX components. A [dedicated page](access.html) explains how to configure and
use logback access in Tomcat and Jetty, and access some of its
components via JMX.

---

### 2006-12-18 Release of version 0.7

Version 0.7 of logback has been released.

Logback now ships with a new module: *log4j-bridge*. This
new module can be used to intercept log4j calls and redirects them
to logback components. More information about this module can be
found in the corresponding [documentation
page](bridge.html).

The documentation has been vastly updated. Two new chapters,
namely Filters and MDC, are available in the manual section.

---

### 2006-11-30 Release of version 0.6

Version 0.6 of logback has been released.

Logback classic now supports automatic configuration, allowing
test and production environment
configuration. `TurboFilters` make their first appearance
in a logback release. They provide ultra-fast filtering
possibilities. The logging context now supports listeners which
will be contacted each time the context is reset or
started. `SMTPAppender` allows for much more flexible
configuration than before.

In logback access, new Appenders are available, namely
`SocketAppender` and `DBAppender`. Logback
access now supports filtering and event evaluations. A
`CountingFilter` has been added. It provides statistical
views of server access, reachable via JMX.

The documentation has also been improved. A complete new chapter
has been added about Appenders, the short introduction to logback
classic has been updated and a new module, containing many
configuration examples has been added.

Logback now uses continuous integration in its development.

Tests have been improved, many new have been added. This release
also provides some bug fixes.

# RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R4 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance to proxy requests with a persistent cookie store (cookies are stored locally and are not passed between the client and the end URL) which means all clients using that proxy are sharing the same cookies. (CVE-2017-2589)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues. (CVE-2016-8749)
* It was found that Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded / to a request an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. (CVE-2016-9879)
* It was found that a path traversal vulnerability in hawtio leads to a NullPointerException with a full stacktrace. An attacker could use this flaw to gather undisclosed information from within hawtio's root. (CVE-2017-2594)
* It was found that Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk, JWT access tokens, or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMAC secret key algorithms. (CVE-2017-3156)
* It was found that Apache Camel's validation component evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE). (CVE-2017-5643)
* It was found that a flaw exists in JAX-RS clients using the streaming approach for XML signatures and encryption, where it does not enforce the message to be signed/encrypted. This could allow an attacker to subvert the integrity of the message. (CVE-2017-5653)
* It was found that the token cacher in Apache cxf uses a flawed way of caching tokens that are associated with the delegation token received from Security Token Service (STS). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a token which could return an identifier corresponding to a cached token for another user. (CVE-2017-5656)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)
* It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system. (CVE-2017-7957)

The CVE-2017-2589 issue was discovered by Adam Willard (Blue Canopy) and Dennis Reed (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-2594 issue was discovered by Hooman Broujerdi (Red Hat).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

We'll see what we'll hear from the reporter (see [comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1435973#c7))   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1435973#c12)  Ivan Necas    2018-01-12 09:38:54 UTC  ``` Given we didn't get any additional inputs, I believe the original issue is addressing the customer concers about the current state and setting the bz to post: it doesn't change the default way of formatting the dates, but makes it much easier to get to the other format.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1435973#c13)  Perry Gagne    2018-08-01 20:11:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1472199](attachment.cgi?id=1472199 "screen shot of reports page with mouseover") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1472199&action=edit "screen shot of reports page with mouseover") screen shot of reports page with mouseover   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1435973#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-16 15:27:32 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Red Hat Satellite engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on Satellite to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs will be migrated starting at the end of May. If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SAT-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c0)  Marcel Gazdík    2017-03-09 13:20:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:   The host page has possibility to filter hosts based on multiple keys. One of them is user.* which is filtering the hosts based on their owner, however, the owner can't be only user, but also usergroup. Therefore the usergroup filter should be implemented as well.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 6.2.x  How reproducible: On satellite, try to use search and find hosts based on their respective usergroup.  Actual results:   Usergroup filtering is missing.  Expected results:   Usergroup filter will be added.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c3)  Marek Hulan    2017-03-09 13:35:56 UTC  ``` Created redmine issue <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/18854> from this bug   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c6)  Satellite Program    2018-03-13 14:06:45 UTC  ``` Upstream bug assigned to dhlavacd   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c7)  Satellite Program    2018-03-13 14:06:49 UTC  ``` Upstream bug assigned to dhlavacd   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c8)  Satellite Program    2018-03-19 14:06:44 UTC  ``` Moving this bug to POST for triage into Satellite 6 since the upstream issue <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/18854> has been resolved.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c9)  Martin Korbel    2018-06-08 13:04:12 UTC  ``` Verified on Sat6.4 snap 6.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1430742#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-16 15:27:32 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHSA-2017:1675 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:

# RHSA-2017:1675 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.4 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that GZIPInterceptor is enabled when not necessarily required in RESTEasy. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-6346)
* It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-9606)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)

RHSA-2017:1676 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-07-04
Updated:
2017-07-04
# RHSA-2017:1676 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BRMS security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.4 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that GZIPInterceptor is enabled when not necessarily required in RESTEasy. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-6346)
* It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-9606)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)

Red Hat would like to thank Mikhail Egorov (Odin) for reporting CVE-2016-6346 and Moritz Bechler (AgNO3 GmbH & Co. KG) for reporting CVE-2016-9606.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-01 17:08:24 UTC  ``` It was found that SnakeYAML unmarshalling is exploitable for code execution. As RESTeasy enables the yaml provider by default, therefore this is exploitable for JAX-RS applications specifiying either a yaml content type @Consumes or one without type specifiction.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-01 17:09:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Moritz Bechler (AgNO3 GmbH & Co. KG)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c4)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-09 03:20:17 UTC  ``` For Resteasy, it's a requirement that the @Consumes() annotation doesn't define a mime type, or defines a multipart mime type. Explicitly defining 'text/x-yaml', would also make that endpoint vulnerable. If the @Consumes annotation explicitly defines a 'application/json', or 'application/xml' it is not vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-12 06:11:14 UTC  ``` Resteasy versions from 3.0-beta-1 up to and including 3.1.0.CR3 are potentially affected.  Resteasy versions from 2.2.0.GA in the 2.x range are also potentially affected.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-12 06:24:49 UTC  ``` EAP 7.0 is not affected because a bug in Resteasy which prevents the loading of YamlProvider in that version. The YamlProvider is unsupported:  <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/7.0/paged/700-release-notes/chapter-3-unsupported-and-deprecated-functionality>  However we do plan to fix this issue in EAP 7.1   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c9)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-13 01:52:20 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Add authentication and authorization to any Resteasy endpoint which doesn't define a mime type, or defines a multipart mime type.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c12)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-15 04:55:58 UTC  ```  Created resteasy tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1404912](show_bug.cgi?id=1404912 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-9606 Resteasy: Yaml unmarshalling vulnerable to RCE [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c15)  Jason Shepherd    2017-02-28 23:41:19 UTC  ``` Upstream tracker can be found here: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1618>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c17)  Martin Prpič    2017-03-28 10:18:31 UTC  ``` Please note that the previous CVE ([CVE-2016-9571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9571)) was rejected in favor of the newly assigned [CVE-2016-9606](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9606). This was because the [CVE-2016-9571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9571) ID was mistakenly double-assigned by MITRE to a Camel issue:  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9571>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c18)  Jason Shepherd    2017-04-02 23:51:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  YamlProvider was removed the default list of providers to prevent a malicous user from requesting a payload be marshalled with Yaml. If marshalling of Yaml content is desired, add, or append a file with the name 'META-INF/services/javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers' to your WAR, or JAR with the contents 'org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.providers.YamlProvider'  If YamlProvider is re-added to the default list of providers it's recommended to add authentication, and authorization to the endpoint expecting Yaml content to prevent exploitation of this vulnerablilty.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-12 12:53:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jason Shepherd from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1400644#c15)) > Upstream tracker can be found here: > <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1618>  According to the information in the still non-public RESTEASY-1618, this was fixed in resteasy 3.0.22 and 3.1.2.  The following upstream commit references RESTEASY-1618:  <https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/commit/bccadffa2df8ecaff6616df18d2f3b1210866b99>  It seems to disable Yaml provider.  There is no mention of the change in the announcement blog post or upstream release notes:  <https://developer.jboss.org/en/resteasy/blog/2017/03/31/resteasy-312final-and-3022final-are-out>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
