{
  "CVE-2017-5929": {
    "Description": "It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains.",
    "Root cause": "Logback allows remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver, which can accept untrusted serialized data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data",
       "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by leveraging deserialization of custom gadget chains",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access via SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interface"
     ],
    "Required capabilities": [
      "Authenticated attacker on the adjacent network"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability lies in the way Logback handles serialized data received through its SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces, which are used for remote logging. By sending specially crafted serialized data, an attacker can trigger the deserialization of malicious objects, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is a type of remote code execution vulnerability, which can be very serious as it allows an attacker to take full control of the affected system. The vulnerability exists because Logback does not properly validate or sanitize the incoming serialized data, and it allows arbitrary objects to be deserialized, enabling the execution of malicious code."
