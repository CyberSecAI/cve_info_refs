Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises because attachments were being opened in a new browser tab instead of being downloaded. This allowed for the execution of malicious HTML within the domain of the Zammad application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Attachment Handling:** The primary weakness was the application's behavior of displaying attachments directly in the browser, rather than forcing a download.
*   **Lack of File Type Handling:** The application did not properly distinguish between safe and potentially dangerous file types such as HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By displaying HTML attachments directly in the browser, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute within the context of the Zammad application.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful XSS attacks could be leveraged to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data visible to the user via a malicious script.
*   **Defacement:** Malicious scripts might also be used to modify the application's user interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker would upload a crafted HTML file as an attachment.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim would then need to open the malicious attachment, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Zammad Access:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a file via the Zammad application, either through a regular user account or through some other vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 1.2.0
*   The issue was fixed in Zammad versions 1.0.4, 1.1.3, and 1.2.1
* The fix involved forcing downloads for attachments instead of displaying them in a new tab. This prevents the malicious HTML from being executed in the Zammad domain.
