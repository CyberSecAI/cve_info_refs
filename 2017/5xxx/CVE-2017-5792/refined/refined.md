Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of Java objects within the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry of HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) Platform. Specifically, the `euplat` RMI registry is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes untrusted data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized Java objects. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Vulnerable Libraries:** The `euplat` component includes vulnerable libraries such as:
    - Commons-Beanutils
    - Commons-FileUpload
    - Jython
    - JSON-lib
- **Exposed RMI Registry:** The `euplat` RMI registry listens on TCP port 21195 and is bound to all interfaces by default, making it accessible to remote attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the iMC service (typically Administrator on Windows), leading to full system compromise.
- **Remote File Manipulation:** Certain libraries can allow remote file manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:**  A remote attacker can connect to the exposed RMI registry via TCP port 21195.
- **Malicious RMI Call:** The attacker sends a crafted, malicious serialized Java object to the vulnerable RMI registry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the target system on TCP port 21195.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the RMI registry is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized Java object using available vulnerable libraries (e.g., `CommonsBeanutils1`, `JSON1`). Tools like `ysoserial` can be used for this purpose.
-  The attacker needs to know the IP address of the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The initial patch by HPE removed the `Jython1` and `CommonsBeanutils1` attack vectors but did not address the `JSON1` vulnerability, which remained exploitable.
- The `seplat` RMI registry, listening on TCP port 18888, was not found to be vulnerable due to lack of exploitable libraries.

**Affected versions:**
- HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT version 7.3 E0504P2 and earlier versions are vulnerable.

**Solution**
Upgrade to HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT 7.3 E0506P07 or later.

**Note:**
The Tenable advisory refers to two different advisories, TRA-2017-18 and TRA-2018-01. TRA-2018-01 is a follow-up advisory because HPEâ€™s initial fix did not address all attack vectors.
