# [R1] HP Intelligent Management Center (iMC) Platform euplat RMI Registry Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

During the process of writing a detection plugin for [CVE-2016-4372](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4372) / [HP c05200601](https://h20564.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c05200601), Tenable discovered these additional issues. CVE-2016-4372 describes the deserialization of Java objects associated with the Apache Commons Collections library leading to remote code execution. There are a few affected HP products, but our interest was in "HPE iMC PLAT before 7.2 E0403P04". We installed and tested "iMC PLAT 7.2 E0403P06" on a Windows 7 box to investigate further. Note that the PoC written for this advisory is Windows-centric. Don't judge us. Additionally, to anyone who ever tries to install iMC in the future: the database has some very specific settings that have to be set, [just 34 pages worth](https://h20565.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?sp4ts.oid=4176520&docId=emr_na-c03939082&docLocale=en_US).

Exploit Vector: RCE through RMI Registry

iMC has two RMI registries: `euplat` and `seplat`. You can find their configuration files in `C:\Program Files\iMC\euplat\conf` and `C:\Program Files\iMC\seplat\conf`. By looking in their configuration files we can determine that `seplat` listens on TCP port 18888 and euplat lists on TCP port 21195. Why are we interested in RMI registries? RMI Registries communicate with clients by serialization. Therefore it’s a very good target for investigating deserialization vulnerabilities. The next question we need to address: can a remote attacker reach the RMI registry?

```

albino_lobster@WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A /cygdrive/c/Program Files/iMC
$ netstat -ab | grep 18888
  TCP    0.0.0.0:18888          WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A:0      LISTENING
  TCP    [::]:18888             WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A:0      LISTENING

albino_lobster@WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A /cygdrive/c/Program Files/iMC
$ netstat -ab | grep 21195
  TCP    0.0.0.0:21195          WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A:0      LISTENING
  TCP    [::]:21195             WIN-3QDBKNO2F6A:0      LISTENING

```

Yes, the registries appear to be bound to all interfaces. Additionally, HP documentation indicates that the port range used by `euplat` is for "*IMC master and subordinate communication*" (see "TCP usage" in the [7.2 (E0403) release notes](https://h20565.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?sp4ts.oid=4176520&docId=emr_na-c04905979&docLocale=en_US))). This means that if a firewall is configured, it should allow for these communications. We also found documentation of HP showing their user configurations with the Windows firewall completely disabled (see figure 45 on page 26 of the "[Deployment Migration to New Subordinate Server Configuration Examples](https://h20565.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?sp4ts.oid=4176520&docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-c05162579)" document).

Based on the above, we think it is fair to say we might be able to remotely connect to one of the RMI registries. Is the serialization communication exploitable? We need to look what libraries are available. We quickly can rule out `seplat`. It has few libraries available and none of use to us.

Euplat is a different story. It has a few of our favorite things:

* Commons-Beanutils (RCE)
* Commons-FileUpload (Remote file manipulation)
* Jython (RCE)
* JSON-lib (RCE)

Tenable created an proof of concept (`exploit_euplatRMI.py`), that can use any of the three RCE libraries (usage information is in the header). The remotely executed code is run as Administrator on Windows systems. It was shared with ZDI, not you.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [R1] HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT Java RMI RCE

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

After the publication of [TRA-2017-18](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-18), Tenable began to work on an exploit plugin. During research for the new plugin Tenable discovered that HPE's patch didn't fix all issues associated with TRA-2017-18. Specifically, TRA-2017-18 achieved remote code execution over Java RMI using the [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) payloads [Jython1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/Jython1.java), [CommonsBeanutils1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/CommonsBeanutils1.java), or [JSON1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/JSON1.java). HPE's patch removed the Jython1 and CommonsBeanutils1 attack vectors but JSON1 was never patched.

### Solution

Upgrade to HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT 7.3 E0506P07 or later.
