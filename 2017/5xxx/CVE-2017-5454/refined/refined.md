{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2017-5454",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of paths received by FileSystemRequestParent before passing them to IsDescendantPath.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The file picker could be used to select a directory, and then the content process could send a FileSystemRequestParent request for a path that uses '..' to access a file outside of the directory selected.",
       "The FileSystemUtils::IsDescendantPath() was considering the second path to be a descendant of the first, leading to the sandbox escape."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allows a content process to access files that it should not be allowed to, leading to a sandbox escape.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious web page or script using the file picker to access files outside the intended scope by constructing relative paths with '..'",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to run scripts in the context of the browser, and the user has to interact with the file picker."
