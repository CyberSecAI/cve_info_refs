Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-5617

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `svgSalamander` library, a Java SVG engine, processes user-supplied SVG files without properly sanitizing the `xlink:href` attribute within the `<image>` tag. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary URLs, leading to potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The core vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The library fails to validate or sanitize the `xlink:href` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Internal Network Access:** An attacker can bypass firewalls and access internal services or resources by forcing the server to send requests to internal network addresses.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker may be able to probe internal systems to get version information, enumerate running services, etc.
*   **Denial of Service:** By sending a very high number of requests, or by targeting services that can cause resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SVG File:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file containing a `<image>` tag with an arbitrary URL in the `xlink:href` attribute.
*   **User-Supplied SVG Files:** The attack is successful if the vulnerable application is processing user-supplied SVG files.
*   **Unrestricted Schemes:**  The vulnerability also allows the usage of various schemes, like `file://` and `jar://`,  not just `http(s)`, expanding the attack surface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to provide SVG to the vulnerable service**: The attacker needs to be able to provide an SVG file to the service that uses the vulnerable library. This may be via file upload or other means depending on the specific application
*   **Network access** The attacker does not need to be on the internal network but can initiate requests to internal network hosts from the compromised system.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the `svgSalamander` library until the fix is applied in version `1.1.2` and later.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `ImageSVG.java` file within the `svg-core` module, specifically the handling of `xlink:href` attribute at <https://github.com/blackears/svgSalamander/blob/master/svg-core/src/main/java/com/kitfox/svg/ImageSVG.java#L120>.
*   The recommended fix is to disallow any scheme other than `data` for the `xlink:href` attribute by default.
*   Several distributions, including Fedora and Debian, released security updates to address this vulnerability.
* Gentoo discontinued the package recommending users unmerge it.
