Hello,

Today we're releasing security fixes for CVE-2017-5985.

This security issue was reported by Jann Horn from Google and has to do
with a lack of netns ownership check in lxc-user-nic, which would allow
any user with a lxc-usernet allocation to create network interfaces on
the host including choosing the name of that network interface.

The created interface wouldn't be UP so is unlikely to be automatically
brought up or get an address, but this issue could be used to squat the
name of a real system network interface before it appears.

The fix we're pushing today has lxc-user-nic drop privilege to the
requesting user at interface rename time. This will still allow users to
create veth pairs but it will not let them be renamed to whatever they
want.

Original report: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1654676](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc/%2Bbug/1654676)

We have fixes for all supported LXC branches:
 - stable-1.0: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/c905f00ad78b78a5e9c0d67504b86e00dfe085ec>
 - stable-2.0: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/d512bd5efb0e407eba350c4e649c464a65b712a3>
 - master: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/16af238036a5464ae8f2420ed3af214f0de875f9>

We also have a backported version of the fix for LXC 1.1 should anyone
still use this unsupported version of LXC:
<https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/7e678d3d2a297abe8a6e2d673a7ada3994ebe4e5>

Distributions have been notified ahead of this release so most of them
should have updated packages out already or will really soon.

This security fix will be included in the next round of LXC bugfix
releases, until then, people building by hand should be including the
fixes above.

Before this commit, lxc-user-nic could potentially have been tricked into
operating on a network namespace over which the caller did not hold privilege.

This commit ensures that the caller is privileged over the network namespace by
temporarily dropping privilege.

Subject: LXC: CVE-2017-5985: lxc-user-nic didn't verify network namespace
 ownership

Jann Horn discovered that the lxc-user-nic program could be tricked into
operating on a network namespace over which the caller did not hold
privilege.

The behavior didn't follow what was documented in the lxc-user-nic(1)
man page:

 It ensures that the calling user is privileged over the network
 namespace to which the interface will be attached.

This issue is CVE-2017-5985.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5736 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5736)

#### Description

runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.

```
Hello,

Today we're releasing security fixes for CVE-2017-5985.

This security issue was reported by Jann Horn from Google and has to do
with a lack of netns ownership check in lxc-user-nic, which would allow
any user with a lxc-usernet allocation to create network interfaces on
the host including choosing the name of that network interface.

The created interface wouldn't be UP so is unlikely to be automatically
brought up or get an address, but this issue could be used to squat the
name of a real system network interface before it appears.

The fix we're pushing today has lxc-user-nic drop privilege to the
requesting user at interface rename time. This will still allow users to
create veth pairs but it will not let them be renamed to whatever they
want.

Original report: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1654676](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc/%2Bbug/1654676)

We have fixes for all supported LXC branches:
 - stable-1.0: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/c905f00ad78b78a5e9c0d67504b86e00dfe085ec>
 - stable-2.0: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/d512bd5efb0e407eba350c4e649c464a65b712a3>
 - master: <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/16af238036a5464ae8f2420ed3af214f0de875f9>

We also have a backported version of the fix for LXC 1.1 should anyone
still use this unsupported version of LXC:
<https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/7e678d3d2a297abe8a6e2d673a7ada3994ebe4e5>

Distributions have been notified ahead of this release so most of them
should have updated packages out already or will really soon.

This security fix will be included in the next round of LXC bugfix
releases, until then, people building by hand should be including the
fixes above.

# lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

### Bug Description

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is running in the network namespace to which the interface will be attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

   /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

   command:

   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

   with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

   user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges (setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns() call. This way, the renaming could only succeed if the caller is actually privileged in the network namespace.

release: Ubuntu 16.10

version: lxc-common: 2.0.6-0ubuntu1~ubuntu16.10.1

Hi,

thanks for taking a close look at this. Indeed, this is one of the two pieces of unprivileged container startup which run with raised privilege, which we would much rather have running without. There may be better ways to structure this, and perhaps we should brainstorm and discuss them during the upcoming lxc hackfest before FOSDEM.

Going over lxc-user-nic as it stands now, the specific concern you raise \*appears\* to be addressed by the use of 'may\_access\_netns(pid)', which ensures that the caller is privileged over the network namespace being manipulated. If you see specific problems there, please let us know, but this should address exactly what is mentioned in this bug subject.

The other thing you mention is bad nic names. This \*shouldn't\* be an issue since the caller is privileged over his own network namespace (the target), so may confuse his tools however he likes; however outside administrators may end up trying to look inside the container and get confused, so perhaps some sanity checks on special characters would be worthwhile. The main counterpoint to that is that the container admin could always just re-add the special characters later, so we're not really adding any security by preventing it at container startup.

I'm going to keep this bug open for now as we have this conversation. Thanks again.

may\_access\_netns(pid) only checks whether the ruid has read access to /proc/$pid/ns/net. However, being able to open that special file does not imply any kind of privilege over the target namespace, it just implies privilege over the process that is inside the namespace. To test this, you can e.g. run the following command as a normal user:

strace cat /proc/$$/ns/net 2>&1 | grep open.\*ns/net

Have you tried running the commands from my bug report?

Hi Jann,

I managed to reproduce this following the steps you outlined. I will wait for

@Serge to figure out why he was not able to reproduce this.

I can't explain why it doesn't work on my laptop. In a fresh xenial container, using the same ppa I use on my laptop and same kernel, I can reproduce it.

So while it's probably low priority as security issues go, I do think this is a security issue.

Christian, are you interested in floating a proposed fix for this here?

So, yes, temporarily dropping privilege sounds fine. I'll come up with a proposed patch.

Nit: It would be a little bit more robust to explicitly specify CLONE\_NEWNET in the setns() call.

Apart from that, I think it looks fine.

@Jann, I'm going to do some more code-cleanup for lxc-user-nic and will likely add this as part of it.

Thanks, Christian. Is there a reason why you don't set fret to -1 if the final setns fails?

If the setns() back to the original namespace fails but everything

else succeeded I didn't take it to be a security issue. lxc-user-nic

is pretty short-lived and we don't perform any interesting operations

in the namespace after rename\_in\_ns() succeeded. We rather exit right

away:

/\* Now rename the link. \*/

if (rename\_in\_ns(pid, cnic, &vethname) < 0) {

        usernic\_error("%s", "Failed to rename the link.\n");

        exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

}

/\* Write the name of the interface pair to the stdout - like

Title:

lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

Status in lxc package in Ubuntu:

New

Bug description:

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is

running in the network namespace to which the interface will be

attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

command:

  /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into

operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID

while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the

netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that

the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target

namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems

interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces

whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and

backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a

security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security

impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges

(setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns()

call. This way, the renaming could only succeed if the caller is

actually privileged in the network namespace.

On second thought, I've convinced myself on irc that there is a legitimate case where this would fail, which current lxc would not support. If I create a container in a new userns without a separate netns (sharing the parent netns), then want to create a unpriv container in there, then the setns back to original will (if i'm thinking right) fail.

@Serge, I'm not entirely clear if by "would not support" you're trying to imply

that we should actually fail when setns() back fails.

To me it feels like we want is what is happening in the patch,

meaning we don't want to fail.

Given the premises in your argument, what I understand is:

1) You're in a new user namespace u1 but share the parent's network namespace n0.

2) You're cloning a new user namespace u2 and a new network namespace n1 in user namespace u1.

3) You're then using setns(n1\_fd, CLONE\_NEWNET) and rename a veth device.

4) You're using setns(n0\_fd, CLONE\_NEWNET) to attach back to network namespace n0.

1)-3) should succeed.

4) should fail.

But 4) failing is not sufficient reason to ban the user from being successful

in administering veth devices in a network namespace (here n1) where it has sufficient

privileges, right?

So I'd argue we should let the patch stand as it is, no?

As i said,

"I've convinced myself on irc that there is a legitimate case where this would fail, which current lxc would not support"

It's a tradeoff in my mind. Remembering that lxc-user-nic runs as setuid-root, ignoring any unexpected failure is dangerous. That was the real cause of the sendmail-capabilities bug.

Actually, now I've just convinced myself that the above case is \*not\* legitimate.

If root is not able to setns() back to the original netns, then it also would not have been able to create a network device in that namespace, or attach it to the bridge in that namespace.

So there is, AFAICS, no legitimate case where setns(oldfd, 0) would fail, but execution should continue as normal.

That was my first conception but I was unable to console this with your first

argument. Of course, this also implies that we error out in any case

and the second setns(ofd, 0) still doesn't matter. But the point about

setuid is well

taken. I adjusted the patch accordingly and also inserted the CLONE\_NEWNET

into the setns() calls like @Jann suggested. :)

Thanks, looks good.

Somewhat related - but not a blocker for this bug - is that if we fail at this point, we perhaps should try to clean up the nics we had created on the host. Maybe. On the other hand, if we try to clean up but do so in a buggy way, we could really mess with the host's network interfaces. So not something to rush into.

Ok, so what we need from an upstream point of view is:

 - Patch for stable-1.0

 - Patch for stable-2.0

 - Patch for master

That will cover everything we care about and will let us prepare distribution uploads in the private security PPA.

Unless there is a rush on this, we'd like to delay the release of the security update by a couple of weeks to allow for the newly release LXD 2.0.7 to hit the various distributions and so we can then build the patched LXC on top of that rather than have to stop propagation of LXC 2.0.7 to push a patched 2.0.6.

Security team: Can we get a CVE for this?

Exploitation of this issue will allow an unprivileged LXC user with a valid lxc-usernet quota to create those interfaces in the host network namespace rather than inside a container.

In most cases this would merely pollute the host network namespace but be capped by the number of devices the user can create (lxc-usernet quota). The user won't be granted any kind of actual access to the create devices and the host side of the veth pair will still be connected to an authorized bridge. The user also will not be able to choose the name of the create device so can't use this to squat valid network device names on the host.

The one potential attack I can think of is if the host is somehow configured to auto-DHCP on any new network interface, in which case, the user would be able to create a normal LXC container, run a DHCP server there, trying to be faster than the one ran by LXC itself, and then create a veth in the host namespace, therefore allowing DHCP configuration of the host, potential attacks on the host DHCP client and routing host traffic through a container.

So as far as security issues go, I'd say this is a low priority one.

So getting a CVE assigned to this may take a little while as the assignment process has changed in the past day or so and doesn't seem to cover the issuance of CVE numbers for embargoed issues.

Our security team is getting in touch with MITRE to sort this out and we'll get going with scheduling disclosure and preparing the various uploads once that's sorted out.

There is a separate patch attached:

0001-security-ensure-target-netns-is-caller-owned\_1point0.patch

@Serge, @Jann, please give the patches another look if in case

I messed something up.

Thanks again @Jann.

Thanks @Stéphane and the security team for sorting the MITRE stuff out!

Title:

lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

Status in lxc package in Ubuntu:

New

Bug description:

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is

running in the network namespace to which the interface will be

attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

command:

  /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into

operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID

while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the

netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that

the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target

namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems

interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces

whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and

backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a

security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security

impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges

(setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns(...

Sorry for not following up on this before, we've been extremely busy fixing and pushing out a lot of LXD releases of the past couple of weeks.

So it looks like we all agree on the fix for this and I'll be uploading fixed Ubuntu packages to our security PPA early next week.

So now we need to figure out a release date for this. I'm going to be away on vacation between the 11th and the 17th, so would like to avoid releasing during that time.

It looks like our best bet would be either this Thursday, 9th of March or Tuesday the 21st of March. I'm fine with either date though I'm a bit worried that the 9th may be too short notice for other distributions.

Security team: What's your opinion on this? And once we agree on one of the two dates, can you take care of notifying the other distros?

Thanks

I'll suggest the 9th on the distros list. If it isn't enough time,

another distro can ask for a later date.

One bug we should resolve after this is released is that "lxc-user-nic" doesn't clean after itself on failure. It really ought to destroy any interface it created if it fails.

This means that even with this security fix, a trusted user will be able to create host veth device pairs but those devices will not be brought UP and the user will not be able to choose their name. The number of devices created will also be tracked and the quota enforced, so this can't be used for DoS.

Note that for LXC 1.x, you should use "/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar" instead as LXC 1.0.x and LXC 1.1.x doesn't take lxcpath and name as arguments.

# lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

|  | [lxc (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxc "Latest release: 1:6.0.3-1, uploaded to main on 2024-12-20 04:41:45.351873+00:00 by pkg-lxc (pkg-lxc-devel), maintained by pkg-lxc (pkg-lxc-devel)") | Fix Released | Undecided | [Christian Brauner](https://launchpad.net/~cbrauner) |  |

### Bug Description

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is running in the network namespace to which the interface will be attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

   /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

   command:

   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

   with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

   user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges (setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns() call. This way, the renaming could only succeed if the caller is actually privileged in the network namespace.

release: Ubuntu 16.10

version: lxc-common: 2.0.6-0ubuntu1~ubuntu16.10.1

Hi,

thanks for taking a close look at this. Indeed, this is one of the two pieces of unprivileged container startup which run with raised privilege, which we would much rather have running without. There may be better ways to structure this, and perhaps we should brainstorm and discuss them during the upcoming lxc hackfest before FOSDEM.

Going over lxc-user-nic as it stands now, the specific concern you raise \*appears\* to be addressed by the use of 'may\_access\_netns(pid)', which ensures that the caller is privileged over the network namespace being manipulated. If you see specific problems there, please let us know, but this should address exactly what is mentioned in this bug subject.

The other thing you mention is bad nic names. This \*shouldn't\* be an issue since the caller is privileged over his own network namespace (the target), so may confuse his tools however he likes; however outside administrators may end up trying to look inside the container and get confused, so perhaps some sanity checks on special characters would be worthwhile. The main counterpoint to that is that the container admin could always just re-add the special characters later, so we're not really adding any security by preventing it at container startup.

I'm going to keep this bug open for now as we have this conversation. Thanks again.

may\_access\_netns(pid) only checks whether the ruid has read access to /proc/$pid/ns/net. However, being able to open that special file does not imply any kind of privilege over the target namespace, it just implies privilege over the process that is inside the namespace. To test this, you can e.g. run the following command as a normal user:

strace cat /proc/$$/ns/net 2>&1 | grep open.\*ns/net

Have you tried running the commands from my bug report?

Hey there,

Just wanted to update this issue to let you know that most of the LXC/LXD team is travelling this week and that we should be able to look into this much closer next week.

I can't explain why it doesn't work on my laptop. In a fresh xenial container, using the same ppa I use on my laptop and same kernel, I can reproduce it.

So while it's probably low priority as security issues go, I do think this is a security issue.

Christian, are you interested in floating a proposed fix for this here?

So, yes, temporarily dropping privilege sounds fine. I'll come up with a proposed patch.

Nit: It would be a little bit more robust to explicitly specify CLONE\_NEWNET in the setns() call.

Apart from that, I think it looks fine.

@Jann, I'm going to do some more code-cleanup for lxc-user-nic and will likely add this as part of it.

Thanks, Christian. Is there a reason why you don't set fret to -1 if the final setns fails?

If the setns() back to the original namespace fails but everything

else succeeded I didn't take it to be a security issue. lxc-user-nic

is pretty short-lived and we don't perform any interesting operations

in the namespace after rename\_in\_ns() succeeded. We rather exit right

away:

/\* Now rename the link. \*/

if (rename\_in\_ns(pid, cnic, &vethname) < 0) {

        usernic\_error("%s", "Failed to rename the link.\n");

        exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

}

/\* Write the name of the interface pair to the stdout - like

\* eth0:veth9MT2L4.

\*/

fprintf(stdout, "%s:%s\n", vethname, nicname);

exit(EXIT\_SUCCESS);

Title:

lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

Status in lxc package in Ubuntu:

New

Bug description:

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is

running in the network namespace to which the interface will be

attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

command:

  /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into

operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID

while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the

netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that

the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target

namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems

interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces

whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and

backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a

security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security

impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges

(setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns()

call. This way, the renaming could only succeed if the caller is

actually privileged in the network namespace.

On second thought, I've convinced myself on irc that there is a legitimate case where this would fail, which current lxc would not support. If I create a container in a new userns without a separate netns (sharing the parent netns), then want to create a unpriv container in there, then the setns back to original will (if i'm thinking right) fail.

@Serge, I'm not entirely clear if by "would not support" you're trying to imply

that we should actually fail when setns() back fails.

To me it feels like we want is what is happening in the patch,

meaning we don't want to fail.

Given the premises in your argument, what I understand is:

1) You're in a new user namespace u1 but share the parent's network namespace n0.

2) You're cloning a new user namespace u2 and a new network namespace n1 in user namespace u1.

3) You're then using setns(n1\_fd, CLONE\_NEWNET) and rename a veth device.

4) You're using setns(n0\_fd, CLONE\_NEWNET) to attach back to network namespace n0.

1)-3) should succeed.

4) should fail.

But 4) failing is not sufficient reason to ban the user from being successful

in administering veth devices in a network namespace (here n1) where it has sufficient

privileges, right?

So I'd argue we should let the patch stand as it is, no?

As i said,

"I've convinced myself on irc that there is a legitimate case where this would fail, which current lxc would not support"

It's a tradeoff in my mind. Remembering that lxc-user-nic runs as setuid-root, ignoring any unexpected failure is dangerous. That was the real cause of the sendmail-capabilities bug.

Actually, now I've just convinced myself that the above case is \*not\* legitimate.

If root is not able to setns() back to the original netns, then it also would not have been able to create a network device in that namespace, or attach it to the bridge in that namespace.

So there is, AFAICS, no legitimate case where setns(oldfd, 0) would fail, but execution should continue as normal.

That was my first conception but I was unable to console this with your first

argument. Of course, this also implies that we error out in any case

and the second setns(ofd, 0) still doesn't matter. But the point about

setuid is well

taken. I adjusted the patch accordingly and also inserted the CLONE\_NEWNET

into the setns() calls like @Jann suggested. :)

Thanks, looks good.

Somewhat related - but not a blocker for this bug - is that if we fail at this point, we perhaps should try to clean up the nics we had created on the host. Maybe. On the other hand, if we try to clean up but do so in a buggy way, we could really mess with the host's network interfaces. So not something to rush into.

Ok, so what we need from an upstream point of view is:

 - Patch for stable-1.0

 - Patch for stable-2.0

 - Patch for master

That will cover everything we care about and will let us prepare distribution uploads in the private security PPA.

Unless there is a rush on this, we'd like to delay the release of the security update by a couple of weeks to allow for the newly release LXD 2.0.7 to hit the various distributions and so we can then build the patched LXC on top of that rather than have to stop propagation of LXC 2.0.7 to push a patched 2.0.6.

Security team: Can we get a CVE for this?

Exploitation of this issue will allow an unprivileged LXC user with a valid lxc-usernet quota to create those interfaces in the host network namespace rather than inside a container.

In most cases this would merely pollute the host network namespace but be capped by the number of devices the user can create (lxc-usernet quota). The user won't be granted any kind of actual access to the create devices and the host side of the veth pair will still be connected to an authorized bridge. The user also will not be able to choose the name of the create device so can't use this to squat valid network device names on the host.

The one potential attack I can think of is if the host is somehow configured to auto-DHCP on any new network interface, in which case, the user would be able to create a normal LXC container, run a DHCP server there, trying to be faster than the one ran by LXC itself, and then create a veth in the host namespace, therefore allowing DHCP configuration of the host, potential attacks on the host DHCP client and routing host traffic through a container.

So as far as security issues go, I'd say this is a low priority one.

So getting a CVE assigned to this may take a little while as the assignment process has changed in the past day or so and doesn't seem to cover the issuance of CVE numbers for embargoed issues.

Our security team is getting in touch with MITRE to sort this out and we'll get going with scheduling disclosure and preparing the various uploads once that's sorted out.

Title:

lxc-user-nic does not ensure that target netns is caller-owned

Status in lxc package in Ubuntu:

New

Bug description:

The documentation for lxc-user-nic claims:

It ensures that the calling

      user is privileged over the network namespace to which the interface

      will be attached.

Actually, the code only verifies that a process of the calling user is

running in the network namespace to which the interface will be

attached. To verify this:

- As root, create a new bridge "lxcbr0".

 - As root, add an entry like "user veth lxcbr0 10" to

/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet.

 - As the user specified in /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet, run the following

command:

  /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic a b $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar

 - Run "ip link show foobar". The output shows that a network interface

with the name "foobar" was created in the init namespace (in which the

user is not privileged).

I suspect that it would also be possible to trick lxc-user-nic into

operating on namespaces the caller can't access by reassigning the PID

while lxc-user-nic is running, between the access check and the

netlink calls - this is probably quite hard to fix, considering that

the netlink interface just uses a PID to identify the target

namespace.

I haven't found any way to actually exploit this; however, it seems

interesting that this can e.g. be used to create network interfaces

whose names contain special characters like dollar, semicolon and

backtick. I'm not sure how dangerous that is - I'm reporting it as a

security bug for now, but if you feel that this has no security

impact, feel free to derestrict it.

One way to fix this might be to temporarily drop privileges

(setresuid(ruid, ruid, 0)) in rename\_in\_ns() after the first setns(...

Sorry for not following up on this before, we've been extremely busy fixing and pushing out a lot of LXD releases of the past couple of weeks.

So it looks like we all agree on the fix for this and I'll be uploading fixed Ubuntu packages to our security PPA early next week.

So now we need to figure out a release date for this. I'm going to be away on vacation between the 11th and the 17th, so would like to avoid releasing during that time.

It looks like our best bet would be either this Thursday, 9th of March or Tuesday the 21st of March. I'm fine with either date though I'm a bit worried that the 9th may be too short notice for other distributions.

Security team: What's your opinion on this? And once we agree on one of the two dates, can you take care of notifying the other distros?

Thanks

I'll suggest the 9th on the distros list. If it isn't enough time,

another distro can ask for a later date.

One bug we should resolve after this is released is that "lxc-user-nic" doesn't clean after itself on failure. It really ought to destroy any interface it created if it fails.

This means that even with this security fix, a trusted user will be able to create host veth device pairs but those devices will not be brought UP and the user will not be able to choose their name. The number of devices created will also be tracked and the quota enforced, so this can't be used for DoS.

Note that for LXC 1.x, you should use "/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic $$ veth lxcbr0 foobar" instead as LXC 1.0.x and LXC 1.1.x doesn't take lxcpath and name as arguments.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# USN-3224-1: LXC vulnerability

9 March 2017

LXC could be made to create arbitrary virtual network interfaces as an
administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [lxc](/security/cves?package=lxc) - Linux Containers userspace tools

Jann Horn discovered that LXC incorrectly verified permissions when creating

virtual network interfaces. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

create virtual network interfaces in network namespaces that they do not own.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c0)  Markos Chandras   2018-06-27 04:47:47 UTC  ``` We are observing the following logs in dmesg when Apparmor is running and we try to start an LXC container  [ 1224.278886] audit: type=1400 audit(1530072884.560:125): apparmor="DENIED" operation="mount" info="failed flags match" error=-13 profile="/usr/bin/lxc-start" name="/usr/lib64/lxc/rootfs/" pid=30575 comm="lxc-start" srcname="/var/lib/lxc/container1/rootfs/" flags="rw, rbind"  For some reason, this is only being triggered on Leap 15 and not 42.3  It's easy to reproduce on a Leap 15 box with the following command  lxc-create -n test -t /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-download -- -r 15.0 -d opensuse -a amd64  Make sure the /var/lib/lxc/test/config file contains lxc.aa_profile = lxc-containers   and then  lxc-start -F -n test  Make sure that apparmor is installed and started before running the container  I believe the reason for the failure is the following lines in the apparmor profile  <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/master/config/apparmor/abstractions/start-container#L12-L13>  My understanding is that /usr/lib64 is not covered in the profile.  Please let me know if you need me to provide more information ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c1)  Markos Chandras   2018-06-27 04:55:17 UTC  ``` This probably also needs fixing to allow lib64  <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/master/config/apparmor/abstractions/start-container#L37-L40>  And the correct profile to reproduce that is 'lxc-container-default-with-nesting' ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c2)  Christian Boltz   2018-06-27 10:53:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Markos Chandras from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c0)) > operation="mount" info="failed flags match" error=-13  > For some reason, this is only being triggered on Leap 15 and not 42.3  Support for confining/restricting mounts via AppArmor was added in kernel 4.12 (IIRC), so the kernel in 42.3 didn't have it.  > My understanding is that /usr/lib64 is not covered in the profile.  Right, the /usr/lib/ rules need to be changed to /usr/lib*/ or /usr/lib{,32,64}/ ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c3)  Johannes Kastl   2018-07-10 19:38:54 UTC  ``` Hi guys,  sorry for the delay, I'll try to take care in the next couple of days.  Johannes ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c4)  Markos Chandras   2018-07-19 11:20:42 UTC  ``` I have now opened <https://github.com/lxc/lxc/pull/2481> upstream to address the problem  If it's only openSUSE which is having this issue, maybe it would make sense to use --libdir=/usr/lib ? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-07-20 09:30:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1099239) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/624230> 15.0 / lxc ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1099239#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-08-01 13:08:57 UTC  ``` openSUSE-RU-2018:2156-1: An update that has one recommended fix can now be installed.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-6556 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6556)

#### Description

lxc-user-nic when asked to delete a network interface will unconditionally open a user provided path. This code path may be used by an unprivileged user to check for the existence of a path which they wouldn't otherwise be able to reach. It may also be used to trigger side effects by causing a (read-only) open of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys). Affected releases are LXC: 2.0 versions above and including 2.0.9; 3.0 versions above and including 3.0.0, prior to 3.0.2.

I am not sure if the apparmor failure is the reason that the container can't be started.

However, it still doesn't make sense why lxc-start fails to work with apparmor errors even when apparmor is not installed. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c3)  Cédric Bosdonnat   2017-04-27 14:14:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Markos Chandras from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c2)) > OK seems like the missing files are in the apparmor-profiles package. > However, it still doesn't make sense why lxc-start fails to work with > apparmor errors even when apparmor is not installed.  aren't lxc containers apparmor enforced by default? IIRC it is the case in the super old version that we have in SLE 11. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c6)  Cédric Bosdonnat   2017-05-03 08:21:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Charles Arnold from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c4)) > Buildservice needs to be fixed to properly specify a real person as the > maintainer of lxc.  `osc maintainer --email -b lxc` shows Johannes as bug owner for lxc, however the email address in Bugzilla and OBS aren't the same.

I am not sure if it can be solved by adding the right rpm dependency/recommends on apparmor to the lxc package.  Can you test this order: - grab a new leap 42.2 machine/VM - Install the apparmor-utils and apparmor-parser packages, which pull in all apparmor packages needed - systemctl start apparmor - install lxc   (there should be no error/warning about /etc/init.d/boot.apparmor during installation) - create the container - start the container  I get an error regarding fuse, but the start works.  lxc-start: utils.c: open_without_symlink: 1626 No such file or directory - Error examining fuse in /usr/lib64/lxc/rootfs/sys/fs/fuse/connections ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c8)  Markos Chandras   2017-05-18 10:05:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Kastl from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c7)) > Sorry for the late answer. >  > I can reproduce the issue.

As I said in [comment#2](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c2) the apparmor-profiles package is not being  pulled in by a 'zypper apparmor-utils apparmor-parser' and as such lxc-start fails.  But even if you install this package I still find it weird that I need apparmor to use LXC. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c9)  Johannes Kastl   2017-06-22 20:22:44 UTC  ``` Sorry for the late answer, I was on and off with this.  zypper in apparmor-profiles and a start of apparmor.service (before installing lxc) is enough to get this going.  And it seems you need apparmor to use lxc, even if you want your containers to be unconfined (which is the default on openSUSE, as apparmor is using some features that are not in the upstream kernel yet, IIRC).  I think this should be reflected in the packages dependencies, however I am not sure if this is worth a maintenance release for Leap 42.2. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c10)  Markos Chandras   2017-06-23 08:30:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Kastl from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c9)) > Sorry for the late answer, I was on and off with this. >  > zypper in apparmor-profiles and a start of apparmor.service (before > installing lxc) is enough to get this going. >  > And it seems you need apparmor to use lxc, even if you want your containers > to be unconfined (which is the default on openSUSE, as apparmor is using > some features that are not in the upstream kernel yet, IIRC).  Ok fair enough then.  >  > I think this should be reflected in the packages dependencies, however I am > not sure if this is worth a maintenance release for Leap 42.2.  But this is a real problem right. I mean, you 'zypper in lxc' and you expect it to work in 42.2. So in my opinion I think that dependencies need to be fixed there as well. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c11)  Johannes Kastl   2017-07-14 07:49:22 UTC  ``` I am working on this (after some delay) and will prepare new packages this weekend. I am in contact with cboltz to see how to handle this the least intrusive way... ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c12)  Johannes Kastl   2017-07-19 19:29:19 UTC  ``` I got some more information from cboltz.  - apparmor is set to enabled after installation, so after a reboot it should be active - lxc requiring apparmor-abstractions should pull in all needed dependencies - Reloading the service or reloading the profile after installation (i.e. in the %post section) should do the trick if apparmor is already running  I prepared an update in home:ojkastl_buildservice:branches:openSUSE:Leap:42.2:Update and enabled publishing.  Marco, could you test the following:  - systemctl status apparmor.service - install lxc package from the repo given above - systemctl status apparmor.service - sudo lxc-create -t download --name foo ...  This works for me even without a reboot of the machine. If this also works for you, I can try to get this released as an update. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c13)  Markos Chandras   2017-07-20 08:58:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Kastl from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c12)) > I got some more information from cboltz. >  > - apparmor is set to enabled after installation, so after a reboot it should > be active > - lxc requiring apparmor-abstractions should pull in all needed dependencies > - Reloading the service or reloading the profile after installation (i.e. in > the %post section) should do the trick if apparmor is already running >  > I prepared an update in > home:ojkastl_buildservice:branches:openSUSE:Leap:42.2:Update and enabled > publishing. >  > Marco, could you test the following: >  > - systemctl status apparmor.service > - install lxc package from the repo given above > - systemctl status apparmor.service > - sudo lxc-create -t download --name foo ... >  > This works for me even without a reboot of the machine.

Apparmor is not being started after lxc installation. The changes you made in the spec file do not seem to start apparmor unconditionally. It only does it if apparmor was previously enabled. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c14)  Johannes Kastl   2017-07-20 10:37:01 UTC  ``` OK. I'll try Christian second solution to just reload the profile after installation. I'll prepare the package and give an update here.  If this does not work either, then it seems that this cannot work without the user manually starting apparmor after installation of lxc (or rebooting the machine in between). Starting a service from another package is obviously not a good idea. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c15)  Johannes Kastl   2017-07-20 19:23:34 UTC  ``` OK, reloading the profile after installation does not work either.  Marco, I am forwarding the state that you tested as an Update for 42.2 and 42.3.  This does not fix the issue completely, but it eases the burden on the user: Reboot the machine or start apparmor and all is working.  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/511706> <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/511707> ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c16)  Johannes Kastl   2017-07-21 15:46:54 UTC  ``` Both updates have been accepted. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1036360#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-07-28 13:07:39 UTC  ``` openSUSE-RU-2017:1987-1: An update that has one recommended fix can now be installed.
