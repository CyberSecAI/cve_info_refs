Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5985:

**Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper network namespace (netns) ownership checks in the `lxc-user-nic` utility. This utility is used by unprivileged users who have been allocated a `lxc-usernet` quota, and it's meant to create virtual network interfaces for use within containers. However, the code did not properly verify if the user had the necessary privileges for the netns where the interface was to be created. Instead it only verified if the calling user had access to the /proc/pid/ns/net file of the process running in the target netns.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient netns Ownership Check:** The `lxc-user-nic` tool failed to ensure that the user invoking the command actually held the correct privileges to operate on the target network namespace.
*   **Privilege Escalation Risk:** Though not directly leading to root escalation, the vulnerability allowed a user with an `lxc-usernet` allocation to perform actions outside of their intended container namespace, potentially impacting the host system's network configuration.
*   **Network Interface Squatting:** An attacker could create network interfaces with arbitrary names in the host's network namespace. This could potentially be used to squat names of real system interfaces, preventing legitimate interfaces from being created.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host Network Pollution:** An attacker could create arbitrary network interfaces on the host system. While these interfaces wouldn't automatically be brought up or assigned IP addresses, this could lead to confusion and misconfiguration.
*   **Potential DHCP Spoofing:** A user could create a veth interface in the host netns and use this to potentially run a malicious DHCP server to influence the network settings of the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user with an existing `lxc-usernet` allocation on the target system.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker would need to execute the vulnerable `lxc-user-nic` command with specific parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target system.
*   **`lxc-usernet` Allocation:** The attacker's user account must have an allocation defined in `/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet` to be able to make use of `lxc-user-nic`.
*   **Basic Understanding of Network Namespaces:** The attacker needs to be aware of the use of PIDs for namespace identification to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows interface creation but not bringing them up or automatically assigning them an address.
*   The vulnerability also allows for the creation of interfaces using unusual characters in the names.

The fix involves having `lxc-user-nic` temporarily drop privileges to the requesting user at interface rename time. This ensures that the target namespace is indeed owned by the user.
