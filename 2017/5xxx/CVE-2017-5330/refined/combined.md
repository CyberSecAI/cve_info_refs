# Ark: Unintended execution of scripts and executable files — GLSA **201701-69**

A vulnerability in Ark might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-apps/ark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **16.08.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **16.08.3-r1** |

### Background

Ark is a graphical file compression/decompression utility with support
for multiple formats.

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in how Ark handles executable files while
browsing a compressed archive. A user could unintentionally execute a
malicious script which has the executable bit set inside of the archive.
This is due to Ark not displaying what files are executable and running
the associated applications for the file type upon execution.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by coercing a user to browse a malicious archive file
within Ark and execute certain files, could execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-apps/ark-16.08.3-r1"

```

It's the approach that's used on Windows as well.  Well we could do that, but only on master. Stable branches can do with my fix above.  Anyway, I'm not sure if we can check the executable bit before extraction. What Ark currently does is extracting the selected entry to a temporary folder, then KRun is called over that url. So the dialog would only ask "you are about to run this file, do you trust it?" ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c6)  Fabian Vogt    2017-01-06 20:24:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Elvis Angelaccio from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c5)) > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c4)) > > Thanks for fixing! > >  > > However, I'm not sure whether this is the right approach. > > What about a dialog that tells the user that it is an executable file and it > > should only be run if it's trusted and also that it may need the archive to > > be extraced somewhere?

I haven't tested the fix yet, what happens now if the user clicks on the file, is it opened in a text editor, so as-if the file weren't executable? If nothing happens at all, I'd consider it as a regression, even.  > Anyway, I'm not sure if we can check the executable bit before extraction. > What Ark currently does is extracting the selected entry to a temporary > folder, then KRun is called over that url.

Check the flag and show the dialog if necessary. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c8)  Elvis Angelaccio    2017-01-07 10:46:34 UTC  ``` Actually there is another issue with the dialog approach: if there is no associated application (e.g. the file is a binary executable), then KRun shows another dialog:  "The file file:///xxx is an executable program. For safety it will not be started."  So this scenario would be a bit annoying: - select binary executable and click Open - ark asks: "this is an exe, do you trust it"? (1st dialog) - user chooses No - KRun says: "The file ... is an executable program. For safety it will not be started." (2nd dialog) ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c9)  Fabian Vogt    2017-01-07 12:07:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Elvis Angelaccio from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c8)) > Actually there is another issue with the dialog approach: if there is no > associated application (e.g. the file is a binary executable), then KRun > shows another dialog: >  > "The file file:///xxx is an executable program.

(2nd dialog)  In that case it's probably the best if clicking on No aborts the whole process instead, if KRun::isExecutable returns true for the mime type. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c10)  Albert Astals Cid    2017-01-09 00:50:48 UTC  ``` Honestly, i would simply and plainly not execute anything, the option is called "Open" not "Run", one could argue that "opening" and executable is running it, but really, in which scenario does running an executable from inside a tarball without extracting the rest is going to work?  I'd vote for keeping it simple, at most if it's an executable raise a warning saying "this is an executable we will not run it", because it's also true that pressing a button and getting nothing back is weird. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=374572#c11)  Elvis Angelaccio    2017-01-09 20:31:27 UTC  ``` Git commit 6b6da3f2e6ac5ca12b46d208d532948c1dbb8776 by Elvis Angelaccio.
