Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection flaw in OpenVPN Access Server version 2.1.4. The application does not properly sanitize or escape CRLF characters (`%0A`) in the URL.
*   This CRLF injection is coupled with improper session cookie handling during authentication. The session cookie is not regenerated after successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CRLF Injection (CWE-113):** The application allows the injection of CRLF characters into HTTP headers through the URL.
*   **Session Fixation (CWE-384):** The application does not regenerate the session cookie after authentication, making it susceptible to session fixation attacks.
*   **Potential HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-93):** While not successfully exploited in the described scenario, the CRLF injection vulnerability has the potential to allow for HTTP Response Splitting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can leverage the CRLF injection and session fixation to steal a victim's session. By controlling the victim's session cookie, the attacker can impersonate the victim and access the OpenVPN Access Server with their privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator account is compromised through session hijacking, the attacker gains administrative access, leading to severe consequences like complete system control.
*  **Potential for further exploitation:** It's noted that while not demonstrated here, the CRLF injection could enable HTTP response splitting, a more severe form of attack, though this attack was not achieved by the researchers

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, requiring no physical access to the target system.
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the CRLF injection payload and sends it to the victim (e.g., via a phishing email).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable OpenVPN Access Server.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious Links:** The attacker needs a way to send or induce the victim to access the crafted URL.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP and the exploit techniques.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Victim Access:** The victim accesses the vulnerable OpenVPN Access Server, obtaining an initial session cookie.
2.  **Malicious URL:** The attacker sends a malicious URL to the victim with a payload to set a specific session cookie value, leveraging the CRLF injection vulnerability.
3.  **Victim Authentication:** The victim authenticates with the OpenVPN-AS application, associating their user profile and permissions with the session cookie controlled by the attacker.
4.  **Attacker Access:** The attacker uses the stolen session cookie to access the OpenVPN-AS application with the victim's privileges.

**Mitigation/Solutions (as of the report):**

*   **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy to filter out CRLF characters in the URI before they reach the OpenVPN Access Server.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict access to the web interface based on IP addresses.
*   **Vendor-side Fixes (Recommended):**
    *   Escape CRLF characters to prevent injection.
    *   Regenerate session cookies after successful authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor did not provide a patch at the time of the report.
*   The researchers attempted HTTP Response Splitting but were unsuccessful.
