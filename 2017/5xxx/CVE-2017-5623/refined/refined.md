Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the ability to change the boot mode of a locked OnePlus 3/3T device via the `fastboot oem boot_mode` command. This command, when used to enter special boot modes (like `rf`, `wlan`, `ftm`), loads the platform in a non-secure configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthorized Boot Mode Change:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to change the boot mode using `fastboot` even when the bootloader is locked.
- **Non-Secure Boot Configuration:** Special boot modes load the platform with ADB access enabled (without host authorization), and SELinux set to permissive mode. This circumvents the security measures of a locked bootloader.
- **Permissive SELinux:**  The device boots with SELinux in permissive mode, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls normally enforced by SELinux.
- **Exposed USB Interfaces:**  With permissive SELinux and unauthorized ADB access, attackers can enable sensitive USB interfaces (e.g. the modemâ€™s `diag` and `AT` interfaces).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By changing the boot mode and achieving permissive SELinux, the attacker effectively elevates their privileges on the device.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can enable the modem's diagnostic interface (`diag`) and potentially extract sensitive information related to the modem. The attacker can also interact with the modem using the AT interface.
- **Modem Configuration Modification:** The attacker could potentially modify modem-related configurations.
- **Bypass Security Controls:** The attacker can bypass security controls normally enforced by SELinux.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device can reboot it into `fastboot` mode and issue the command.
- **Authorized ADB Access:** An attacker with authorized ADB access (e.g., through malware on a PC that has been authorized to communicate with the device) can also perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical access** or authorized ADB access
- Ability to put the phone into `fastboot` mode
- Ability to use `fastboot` commands

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit leaves a visible notification on the screen that the device is in a special mode, which could alert the user.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity because the device will perpetually show a notification after the boot mode change, unlike [CVE-2016-8467](/vulns/aleph-2016002).
- The fix for this issue involved removing the `fastboot oem boot_mode` command in OxygenOS 4.1.0.
