Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-5987:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the SDHCI (SD Host Controller Interface) device emulation in QEMU, specifically during multi-block SDMA (System Direct Memory Access) transfers.
- The issue arises because the `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks` routine doesn't properly check the transfer mode register for multi-block transfers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Infinite Loop:** If the transfer mode register is set such that the block count register is not updated, it leads to an infinite loop in the `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks` routine. The code does not handle the case where the block count is not enabled or zero, resulting in continuous data transfer without decrementing the block counter, hence causing an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user within the guest operating system can trigger this infinite loop, causing the QEMU process to hang or crash, thus leading to a denial of service for the guest VM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest OS:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest operating system running within QEMU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the emulated SDHCI device within the guest OS to initiate a multi-block SDMA transfer with a maliciously crafted transfer mode register.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks` in `hw/sd/sdhci.c`.
- The fix involves checking the `SDHC_TRNS_BLK_CNT_EN` bit in the transfer mode register (`s->trnmod`) and also the block count (`s->blkcnt`) before initiating the transfer. If either the block count is not enabled or the block count is zero, the transfer is aborted and an error is logged.
- The upstream patch includes the addition of the following code snippet to address this vulnerability:
```c
if (!(s->trnmod & SDHC_TRNS_BLK_CNT_EN) || !s->blkcnt) {
        qemu_log_mask(LOG_UNIMP, "infinite transfer is not supported\n");
        return;
    }
```
- This check was added to the beginning of the `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks` routine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was independently reported by Jiang Xin of Huawei and Wjjzhang of Tencent.
- This issue was assigned CVE-2017-5987 and was addressed in QEMU versions 2.8.0-r9 and later.
