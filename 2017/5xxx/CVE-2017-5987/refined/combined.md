# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201704-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could the worst of which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.0-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.0-r9** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote server can cause a crash in the client causing execution of
arbitrary code, and a Denial of Service within the QEMU process. Remote
or Local users within a guest QEMU environment can cause a Denial of
Service condition of the QEMU guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.8.0-r9"

```

Subject: CVE-2017-5987 Qemu: sd: infinite loop issue in multi block
 transfers

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the SDHCI device emulation support is
vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while doing a multi block
SDMA transfer via 'sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks' routine.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-02/msg02776.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421995>

This issue was independently reported by Mr Jiang Xin of Huawei.com and
Wjjzhang of Tencent.com.

'CVE-2017-5987' assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

# QEMU and the Spectre and Meltdown attacks

04 Jan 2018 (Updated 05 Jan 2018) â€” by Paolo Bonzini and Eduardo Habkost

As you probably know by now, three critical architectural flaws in CPUs have
been recently disclosed that allow user processes to read kernel or hypervisor
memory through cache side-channel attacks. These flaws, collectively
named *Meltdown* and *Spectre*, affect in one way or another almost
all processors that perform out-of-order execution, including x86 (from
Intel and AMD), POWER, s390 and ARM processors.

No microcode updates are required to block the *Meltdown* attack. In
addition, the *Meltdown* flaw does not allow a malicious guest to read the
contents of hypervisor memory. Fixing it only requires that the operating
system separates the user and kernel address spaces (known as *page table
isolation* for the Linux kernel), which can be done separately on the host
and the guests. Therefore, this post will focus on *Spectre*, and especially
on [CVE-2017-5715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715).

Fixing or mitigating *Spectre* in general, and CVE-2017-5715 in particular,
requires cooperation between the processor and the operating system kernel or
hypervisor; the processor can be updated through microcode or millicode
patches to provide the required functionality.

Among the three vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5715 is notable because
it allows guests to read potentially sensitive data from hypervisor
memory. Patching the host kernel is sufficient to block attacks from
guests to the host. On the other hand, in order to protect the guest
kernel from a malicious userspace, updates are also needed to the guest
kernel and, depending on the processor architecture, to QEMU.

Just like on bare-metal, the guest kernel will use the new functionality
provided by the microcode or millicode updates. When running under a
hypervisor, processor emulation is mostly out of QEMUâ€™s scope, so QEMUâ€™s
role in the fix is small, but nevertheless important. In the case of KVM:

* QEMU configures the hypervisor to emulate a specific processor model.
  For x86, QEMU has to be aware of new CPUID bits introduced by the microcode
  update, and it must provide them to guests depending on how the guest is
  configured.
* upon virtual machine migration, QEMU reads the CPU state on the source
  and transmits it to the destination. For x86, QEMU has to be aware of new
  model specific registers (MSRs).

Right now, there are no public patches to KVM that expose the new CPUID bits
and MSRs to the virtual machines, therefore there is no urgent need to update
QEMU; remember that **updating the host kernel is enough to protect the
host from malicious guests**. Nevertheless, updates will be posted to the
qemu-devel mailing list in the next few days, and a 2.11.1 patch release
will be released with the fix.

Once updates are provided, **live migration to an updated version of
QEMU will not be enough to protect guest kernel from guest userspace**.
Because the virtual CPU has to be changed to one with the new CPUID bits,
the guest will have to be restarted.

As of today, the QEMU project is not aware of whether similar changes will
be required for non-x86 processors. If so, they will also be posted to the
mailing list and backported to recent stable releases.

For more information on the vulnerabilities, please refer to the [Google Security
Blog](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html)
and [Google Project
Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.it/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)
posts on the topic, as well as the [Spectre and Meltdown FAQ](https://meltdownattack.com/#faq).

**5 Jan 2018**: clarified the level of protection provided by the host kernel
update; added a note on live migration; clarified the impact of Meltdown on
virtualization hosts

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.
