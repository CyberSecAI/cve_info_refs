Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly invalidate the current session when a new password is set through the "forgot password" mechanism.

**Weakness:** Session Fixation (CWE-384). The application does not invalidate the existing session ID after a password reset, allowing an attacker with prior knowledge of the session ID to continue using the authenticated session.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has previously obtained a valid session ID can maintain access to an account even after the password has been changed using the "forgot password" feature. This allows unauthorized access to the targeted user's account and potential sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to a valid session ID of the target user prior to the user initiating a password reset.
*   The attack is triggered by the user performing a "forgot password" and changing their password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have access to a valid session ID of the victim.
* The attacker does not need direct interaction with the password reset process.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Revive Adserver versions <= 4.0.0.
*   The issue is resolved in version 4.0.1 and later.
*   The vulnerability was reported by HackerOne user pavanw3b.
*   The provided CVSSv3 score is 5.9 (base score) and 5.2 (temporal score), indicating a medium severity.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by the commit `b088012e5439f39a86b9d4f1e83b8dcd345f5d34`.
