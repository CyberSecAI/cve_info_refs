Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5886:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `PoDoFo::PdfTokenizer::GetNextToken` function of the PoDoFo library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `GetNextToken` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-based buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application (as seen in the ASan output, "==13498==ABORTING"), or potentially to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted PDF file that causes the `GetNextToken` function to write beyond the bounds of its allocated buffer.
- The `podofocountpages` tool is shown to be vulnerable by loading a malicious PDF, but the vulnerability likely affects other tools using the PoDoFo library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted PDF file to an application using the vulnerable PoDoFo library.
- No specific position within the system is mentioned, the attacker can be a local user or a remote user through an application that processes external PDF files.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASan output includes the call stack, which highlights the sequence of function calls leading to the vulnerability, specifically within the `PdfTokenizer::GetNextToken` function.
- The provided reproducer is a file named `00146-podofo-heapoverflow-PdfTokenizer` in a public GitHub repository. This file can be used to reliably trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The blog post mentions that the upstream project denied the reporter to open a new ticket.
