Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling or disabling of TLS certificate validation within the "BCR Móvil" iOS application. This allows the app to accept invalid or self-signed certificates presented by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient TLS Certificate Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the TLS certificate presented by the server it is connecting to. It does not verify if the certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.
*   **Accepting Invalid Certificates:**  The app accepts invalid certificates, which can be generated by an attacker performing a MitM attack. This behavior bypasses the security provided by TLS/HTTPS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can intercept usernames and passwords transmitted by the application when a user attempts to log in. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's banking account.
*   **Data Manipulation:** A successful MitM attack allows the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate data sent between the application and the server. While the document focuses on credential theft, it's implied that other sensitive data could also be at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a MitM attack. This can occur through:
    *   **Compromised Wi-Fi:** An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network can intercept and manipulate network traffic.
    *   **Compromised Router/Network Infrastructure:** An attacker who has control over network infrastructure can intercept data, especially on less secure networks.
    *   **VPN and ISP compromise:** A malicious VPN provider or a compromised ISP can perform MitM attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically proximate to the victim or in a privileged network position to intercept network traffic between the mobile device and the server.
*   **Network Control:**  The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic using tools such as Wireshark, bettercap etc, and be able to generate fake TLS certificates.

**Specific details:**

The vulnerable version is **3.7** of the "BCR Móvil" application, where data is sent to `movil.bancobcr.com`

**Summary**
The "BCR Móvil" iOS application is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to improper TLS certificate validation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept usernames and passwords, and potentially other sensitive data being transmitted by the app. The vulnerability is present in version 3.7 and has not yet been fixed.
