Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5956:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds (OOB) array access issue in the `vrend_draw_vbo` function within the virglrenderer project. The `vertex_buffer_index`, read from the guest OS, was not validated, and was used to index an array named 'vbo', which could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation: The `vertex_buffer_index` from the guest was not checked against the size of the `vbo` array. This allowed a malicious guest to provide an index that is outside of the bounds of the array.
- OOB array access:  By providing an invalid `vertex_buffer_index`, an attacker could read memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A guest user or process can trigger this flaw to crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service on the host. It is stated in the email to oss-security and Red Hat Bugzilla.

**Attack vectors:**
- Guest OS: The attacker must be running code within a virtualized guest operating system.
- Malicious Input: The attacker manipulates the value of the `vertex_buffer_index` passed to the `vrend_draw_vbo` function to be out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the guest OS environment.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the inputs related to vertex buffer drawing to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was to add a sanity check for the `vertex_buffer_index` within the `vrend_decode_create_ve` function, ensuring that it is within the valid range (less than `PIPE_MAX_ATTRIBS`).
- The vulnerability is fixed in virglrenderer version 0.6.0 and later.
