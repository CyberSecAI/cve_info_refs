{
  "CVE-2017-5403": {
    "description": "When adding a range to an object in the DOM, it is possible to use `addRange` to add the range to an incorrect root object. This triggers a use-after-free, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect handling of ranges with different root objects during `addRange` operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash leading to arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating DOM elements and selections via Javascript"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute Javascript in a browser context.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to missing checks in `Selection::AddRange()` and its related methods, allowing a range from one document to be added to a selection object of another document, leading to a use-after-free when the selection is later used."
