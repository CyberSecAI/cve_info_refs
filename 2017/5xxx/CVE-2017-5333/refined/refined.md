  "CVE-2017-5333": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2017-5333",
      "CveDescription": "Integer overflow in the extract_group_icon_cursor_resource function in b/wrestool/extract.c in icoutils before 0.31.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (process crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted executable file."
    },
    "OfficialDescription": {
      "RootCause": "Integer overflow",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow in `extract_group_icon_cursor_resource` function.",
		"Incorrect bounds check when transferring resource data"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service (process crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "Crafted executable file"
      ],
	  "RequiredCapabilities": "Local user",
       "AffectedSoftware": "icoutils before 0.31.1"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "RootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing size check in the `extract_group_icon_cursor_resource` function within `wrestool/extract.c`. Specifically, the size of the resource being copied isn't validated to ensure it is at least twice the size of a `uint16_t` type before accessing `data[0]` and `data[1]` as x and y coordinates.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Missing size check before accessing resource data as coordinates leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
        "Improper bounds check when handling resource data size.",
		 "Insufficient validation on the size variable within the resource extraction."
      ],
      "Impact": "A crafted executable file could cause a crash due to accessing memory outside the intended boundaries or lead to other undefined behavior, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "A local user can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted executable file as input to the `wrestool` program.",
        "By manipulating the size and offset of the resource in a crafted executable."
      ],
      "RequiredCapabilities": "A local attacker needs to provide a malformed executable file to `wrestool`.",
	   "AdditionalDetails": "The fix involves adding a size check (`size >= sizeof(uint16_t)*2`) before accessing the data to extract coordinates and copying the resource data, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read and integer overflow."
    }
