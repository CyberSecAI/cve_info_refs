Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of password recovery when the feature is disabled in Netgear routers. When a user attempts to access the web panel, cancels authentication, and password recovery is disabled, the user is redirected to a page that exposes a password recovery token. This token can then be used to retrieve the admin password through the `passwordrecovered.cgi` page. Additionally, some versions of the affected routers do not properly validate this token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Password Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the router's admin password.
- **Improper Authentication Handling:** The system fails to properly handle authentication cancellation and redirects users to a page exposing a token.
- **Insecure Token Handling:** The token, meant for password recovery, can be obtained even when the password recovery feature is disabled and is not properly validated in some versions.
- **Unprotected password recovery page:** The page `passwordrecovered.cgi` allows retrieval of credentials without needing to answer the recovery questions when the password recovery feature is disabled and, in some cases, also when it is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Router Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full administrative control of the router.
- **Network Compromise:** With router access, attackers can potentially modify settings, monitor traffic, or use the device as a pivot point for further attacks within the network.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker may be able to intercept data transmitted through the compromised network.
- **Malware Deployment:** The attacker could potentially deploy malware through the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Network:** An attacker on the local network (LAN or WLAN) can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Remote Management (if enabled):** If remote management is enabled on the router, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either locally (connected to the router's network) or remotely (if remote management is enabled).
- **HTTP/HTTPS Request Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know of the vulnerable URL (`passwordrecovered.cgi`).

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB Content:**
- The exploit-db content provides a Python script (`netgore.py` and `netgore2.py`) to automate the exploitation process.
- `netgore.py` performs the attack by obtaining the token from the redirection URL and then using it to fetch credentials.
- `netgore2.py` performs the attack by directly accessing `passwordrecovered.cgi` with an arbitrary token.
- The vulnerability is present by default when the password recovery option is disabled, but does not work correctly on the first request to "passwordrecovered.cgi", and some versions do not properly validate the token, so any value can be used as a token to retrieve credentials.
- The exploit may fail if the password recovery feature is enabled on the router.
- Some routers require a POST request instead of a GET request to the `passwordrecovered.cgi` page.

**Workaround & Remediation:**
- **Enable Password Recovery:** The workaround mentioned in the provided articles, is to enable the password recovery feature in the router's settings, which prevents this specific exploitation method.
- **Disable Remote Management:** If remote access is not needed, disabling remote management mitigates remote exploitation of this vulnerability.
- **Firmware Updates:** The official recommendation is to update the firmware of the affected devices to the latest version that includes a patch.
