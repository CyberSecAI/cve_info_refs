{
  "cve": "CVE-2017-5946",
  "description": "It was discovered that ruby-zip, a Ruby module for reading and writing zip files, is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ruby-zip module does not properly sanitize or validate filenames within a ZIP archive during extraction, allowing relative path components like `..` to be used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal vulnerability",
      "Improper input validation",
        "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system by crafting a malicious ZIP archive containing entries with relative paths. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker overwrites configuration files or other system critical files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious ZIP archive",
        "Extraction of crafted archive"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application a crafted ZIP archive and trigger an extraction process"
  }
