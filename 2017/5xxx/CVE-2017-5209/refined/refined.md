Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `base64decode` function within the `base64.c` file of the `libplist` library. The function does not properly handle split or fragmented base64 encoded data. It appears to process the input data sequentially, and if the base64 encoded data is split across multiple lines, it can lead to issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability is described as a buffer over-read, implying that the `base64decode` function attempts to read beyond the allocated memory when processing split base64 encoded data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer over-read can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The over-read might expose sensitive information from the process memory, as the function could read data beyond its intended buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through providing crafted or split base64 encoded data as input to the `base64decode` function.
- The specific context where this library is used matters. The provided text indicates `libplist` is used for reading and writing Apple binary and XML property lists, part of the `libimobiledevice` stack, for accessing iDevices. Thus, the crafted data would likely be part of a malicious property list file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide crafted or split base64 encoded data to an application using the vulnerable `libplist` library.
- This could occur through a malicious file (like an Apple Property List) processed by an application using `libplist`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code diff from GitHub shows the changes to `base64.c` to address this issue. The original code processed base64 data in blocks, and the fix seems to properly handle fragmented data, including spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and newlines.
- The Debian security advisory confirms this vulnerability and mentions that the fix is included in `libplist` version `1.11-3+deb8u1`.
