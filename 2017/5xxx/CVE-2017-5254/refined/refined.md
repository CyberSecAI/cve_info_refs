{
  "CVE-2017-5254": {
    "Root cause": "Client-side protection bypass. The web interface does not properly enforce access controls, allowing lower-privileged users to modify fields meant to be restricted to higher-privileged users.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control enforcement in the web interface.",
      "Reliance on client-side checks for authorization."
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation. An attacker with a low-privileged user account (installer or home) can gain administrative access by changing the admin password.",
    "Attack vectors": "Web interface manipulation using a browser. An attacker needs to log in with a low-privilege account, then use browser tools to modify the HTML of the page to bypass the restriction.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires valid credentials for a non-readonly user account on the vulnerable device (ePMP v3.5). Attacker needs to be on the same network as the device to access its web interface."
