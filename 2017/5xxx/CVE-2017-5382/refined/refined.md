Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5382:

**CVE-2017-5382: Feed preview can expose privileged content errors and exceptions**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The feed preview functionality for RSS feeds in Firefox was not properly handling exceptions generated by privileged (chrome) content. This allowed internal errors and exceptions from the browser's privileged code to be exposed to web content.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Information Exposure:** Privileged information, including internal errors and exceptions, was being leaked to the content level.
    *   **Lack of proper error handling:** Exceptions occurring in chrome-level code were not properly caught and sanitized before being passed to the content rendering context.
    *   **Cross-compartment issues:** The issue involved cross-compartment wrappers and how they handle exceptions, leading to the leak.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The exposure of internal information could potentially assist an attacker in crafting further exploits by revealing details of the browser's internal workings or vulnerabilities.
    *   While the content does not explicitly state a direct privilege escalation, the possibility exists if a vulnerability in those chrome pages is later discovered.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious website or a compromised website could embed a crafted RSS feed which triggers an error in privileged code when previewed by the user in the browser, thereby capturing the leaked information.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to get a user to view a crafted or manipulated RSS feed. This could be through a link, or an embedded feed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves making `ThrowExceptionObject` return void instead of bool, and stopping propagation of xpconnect exceptions to consumers that are unable to work with them. This prevents the internal error objects from being exposed to content by not reusing existing exception objects in the wrong compartments.
*   The vulnerability was considered "sec-moderate" because, while no direct exploit was known, the nature of the information leak and potential for exploitation made it necessary to address.
*   The fix was uplifted to Firefox 51.
