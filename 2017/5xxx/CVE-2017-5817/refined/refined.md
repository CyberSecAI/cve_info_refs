  "cveId": "CVE-2017-5817",
  "description": "The provided content contains information about a command injection vulnerability in HPE iMC software, specifically related to the 'dbman' service and the 'RestoreDBase' function. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The 'dbman' service does not sanitize the database connection username when restoring a user-specified database (OpCode 10007). This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject operating system commands into the username field.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization",
       "Unauthenticated Access"
     ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands with SYSTEM privileges on the affected Windows server.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network-based attacks over TCP port 2810",
      "Sending crafted packets to the dbman service containing malicious commands within the database username"
    ],
   "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the target system on TCP port 2810. No prior authentication is required."
