# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9588 CVE-2017-2636 CVE-2017-5669 CVE-2017-5986
                 CVE-2017-6214 CVE-2017-6345 CVE-2017-6346 CVE-2017-6348
                 CVE-2017-6353

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.

CVE-2016-9588

    Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel x86
    processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in an
    L2 (nested) virtual machine. A local attacker in an L2 guest VM
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service for
    the L1 guest VM.

CVE-2017-2636

    Alexander Popov discovered a race condition flaw in the n_hdlc
    line discipline that can lead to a double free. A local
    unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege
    escalation. On systems that do not already have the n_hdlc module
    loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-n_hdlc.conf install n_hdlc false

CVE-2017-5669

    Gareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at
    address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it
    easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a
    set-UID program.

CVE-2017-5986

    Alexander Popov reported a race condition in the SCTP
    implementation that can be used by local users to cause a
    denial-of-service (crash). The initial fix for this was incorrect
    and introduced further security issues (CVE-2017-6353). This
    update includes a later fix that avoids those. On systems that do
    not already have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by
    disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-6214

    Dmitry Vyukov reported a bug in the TCP implementation's handling
    of urgent data in the splice() system call. This can be used by a
    remote attacker for denial-of-service (hang) against applications
    that read from TCP sockets with splice().

CVE-2017-6345

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the LLC type 2 implementation
    incorrectly assigns socket buffer ownership. This can be used
    by a local user to cause a denial-of-service (crash). On systems
    that do not already have the llc2 module loaded, this can be
    mitigated by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-llc2.conf install llc2 false

CVE-2017-6346

    Dmitry Vyukov reported a race condition in the raw packet (af_packet)
    fanout feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any
    user namespace) can use this for denial-of-service and possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-6348

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the general queue implementation in
    the IrDA subsystem does not properly manage multiple locks,
    possibly allowing local users to cause a denial-of-service
    (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

sctp: avoid BUG\_ON on sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf

Alexander Popov reported that an application may trigger a BUG_ON in
sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is
waiting on it to queue more data and meanwhile another thread peels off
the association being used by the first thread.

This patch replaces the BUG_ON call with a proper error handling. It
will return -EPIPE to the original sendmsg call, similarly to what would
have been done if the association wasn't found in the first place.

# RHSA-2017:1308 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1308)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the packet\_set\_ring() function of the Linux kernel's networking implementation did not properly validate certain block-size data. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_RAW capability could use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the crash of the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2017-7308, Important)
* Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to an attacker controlled memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds reads. (CVE-2016-10208, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq\_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation. (CVE-2016-7910, Moderate)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could trigger oops in shash\_async\_export() by attempting to force the in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set. (CVE-2016-8646, Moderate)
* It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version v4.10-rc8, an application may trigger a BUG\_ON in sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is waiting on it to queue more data, and meanwhile another thread peels off the association being used by the first thread. (CVE-2017-5986, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo kernel team) for reporting CVE-2016-8646.

Additional Changes:

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements. Documentation for these changes is available from the Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

x86/fpu/xstate: Fix xcomp\_bv in XSAVES header
commit dffba9a31c7769be3231c420d4b364c92ba3f1ac upstream.
The compacted-format XSAVES area is determined at boot time and
never changed after. The field xsave.header.xcomp\_bv indicates
which components are in the fixed XSAVES format.
In fpstate\_init() we did not set xcomp\_bv to reflect the XSAVES
format since at the time there is no valid data.
However, after we do copy\_init\_fpstate\_to\_fpregs() in fpu\_\_clear(),
as in commit:
b22cbe404a9c x86/fpu: Fix invalid FPU ptrace state after execve()
and when \_\_fpu\_restore\_sig() does fpu\_\_restore() for a COMPAT-mode
app, a #GP occurs. This can be easily triggered by doing valgrind on
a COMPAT-mode "Hello World," as reported by Joakim Tjernlund and
others:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=190061
Fix it by setting xcomp\_bv correctly.
This patch also moves the xcomp\_bv initialization to the proper
place, which was in copyin\_to\_xsaves() as of:
4c833368f0bf x86/fpu: Set the xcomp\_bv when we fake up a XSAVES area
which fixed the bug too, but it's more efficient and cleaner to
initialize things once per boot, not for every signal handling
operation.

tcp: don't annotate mark on control socket from tcp\_v6\_send\_response()
commit 92e55f412cffd016cc245a74278cb4d7b89bb3bc upstream.
Unlike ipv4, this control socket is shared by all cpus so we cannot use
it as scratchpad area to annotate the mark that we pass to ip6\_xmit().
Add a new parameter to ip6\_xmit() to indicate the mark. The SCTP socket
family caches the flowi6 structure in the sctp\_transport structure, so
we cannot use to carry the mark unless we later on reset it back, which
I discarded since it looks ugly to me.

Otherwise, RST packets generated by the TCP stack for non-existing

The mark from the original packet is assigned to the netns\_ipv4/6
socket used to send the response so that it can get copied into the

mld: do not remove mld souce list info when set link down
[ Upstream commit 1666d49e1d416fcc2cce708242a52fe3317ea8ba ]
This is an IPv6 version of commit 24803f38a5c0 ("igmp: do not remove igmp
souce list..."). In mld\_del\_delrec(), we will restore back all source filter
info instead of flush them.
Move mld\_clear\_delrec() from ipv6\_mc\_down() to ipv6\_mc\_destroy\_dev() since
we should not remove source list info when set link down. Remove
igmp6\_group\_dropped() in ipv6\_mc\_destroy\_dev() since we have called it in
ipv6\_mc\_down().
Also clear all source info after igmp6\_group\_dropped() instead of in it
because ipv6\_mc\_down() will call igmp6\_group\_dropped().

l2tp: do not use udp\_ioctl()

udp\_ioctl(), as its name suggests, is used by UDP protocols,
but is also used by L2TP :(
L2TP should use its own handler, because it really does not
look the same.
SIOCINQ for instance should not assume UDP checksum or headers.
Thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team for providing the report
and a nice reproducer.

packet: round up linear to header len
[ Upstream commit 57031eb794906eea4e1c7b31dc1e2429c0af0c66 ]
Link layer protocols may unconditionally pull headers, as Ethernet
does in eth\_type\_trans. Ensure that the entire link layer header
always lies in the skb linear segment. tpacket\_snd has such a check.
Extend this to packet\_snd.
Variable length link layer headers complicate the computation
somewhat. Here skb->len may be smaller than dev->hard\_header\_len.
Round up the linear length to be at least as long as the smallest of
the two.

net: introduce device min\_header\_len
[ Upstream commit 217e6fa24ce28ec87fca8da93c9016cb78028612 ]
The stack must not pass packets to device drivers that are shorter
than the minimum link layer header length.
Previously, packet sockets would drop packets smaller than or equal
to dev->hard\_header\_len, but this has false positives. Zero length
payload is used over Ethernet. Other link layer protocols support
variable length headers. Support for validation of these protocols
removed the min length check for all protocols.
Introduce an explicit dev->min\_header\_len parameter and drop all
packets below this value. Initially, set it to non-zero only for
Ethernet and loopback. Other protocols can follow in a patch to
net-next.

pegasus: Use heap buffers for all register access
[ Upstream commit 5593523f968bc86d42a035c6df47d5e0979b5ace ]
Allocating USB buffers on the stack is not portable, and no longer
works on x86\_64 (with VMAP\_STACK enabled as per default).

macvtap: read vnet\_hdr\_size once
[ Upstream commit 837585a5375c38d40361cfe64e6fd11e1addb936 ]
When IFF\_VNET\_HDR is enabled, a virtio\_net header must precede data.
Data length is verified to be greater than or equal to expected header
length tun->vnet\_hdr\_sz before copying.
Macvtap functions read the value once, but unless READ\_ONCE is used,
the compiler may ignore this and read multiple times. Enforce a single
read and locally cached value to avoid updates between test and use.

tcp: avoid infinite loop in tcp\_splice\_read()
[ Upstream commit ccf7abb93af09ad0868ae9033d1ca8108bdaec82 ]
Splicing from TCP socket is vulnerable when a packet with URG flag is
received and stored into receive queue.
\_\_tcp\_splice\_read() returns 0, and sk\_wait\_data() immediately
returns since there is the problematic skb in queue.
This is a nice way to burn cpu (aka infinite loop) and trigger
soft lockups.
Again, this gem was found by syzkaller tool.

If GRE flags contains GRE\_KEY, the following expression
\*(((\_\_be32 \*)p) + (grehlen / 4) - 1)
accesses data ~40 bytes after the expected point, since
grehlen includes the size of IPv6 headers.

net: use a work queue to defer net\_disable\_timestamp() work
[ Upstream commit 5fa8bbda38c668e56b0c6cdecced2eac2fe36dec ]
Dmitry reported a warning [1] showing that we were calling
net\_disable\_timestamp() -> static\_key\_slow\_dec() from a non
process context.
Grabbing a mutex while holding a spinlock or rcu\_read\_lock()
is not allowed.
As Cong suggested, we now use a work queue.
It is possible netstamp\_clear() exits while netstamp\_needed\_deferred
is not zero, but it is probably not worth trying to do better than that.
netstamp\_needed\_deferred atomic tracks the exact number of deferred
decrements.

stmmac: Discard masked flags in interrupt status register
[ Upstream commit 0a764db103376cf69d04449b10688f3516cc0b88 ]
DW GMAC databook says the following about bits in "Register 15 (Interrupt
Mask Register)":
--------------------------->8-------------------------
When set, this bit \_\_disables\_the\_assertion\_of\_the\_interrupt\_signal\_\_
because of the setting of XXX bit in Register 14 (Interrupt
Status Register).
--------------------------->8-------------------------
In fact even if we mask one bit in the mask register it doesn't prevent
corresponding bit to appear in the status register, it only disables
interrupt generation for corresponding event.
But currently we expect a bit different behavior: status bits to be in
sync with their masks, i.e. if mask for bit A is set in the mask
register then bit A won't appear in the interrupt status register.
This was proven to be incorrect assumption, see discussion here [1].
That misunderstanding causes unexpected behaviour of the GMAC, for
example we were happy enough to just see bogus messages about link
state changes.
So from now on we'll be only checking bits that really may trigger an
interrupt.

This function suffers from multiple issues.
First one is that pskb\_may\_pull() may reallocate skb->head,
so the 'raw' pointer needs either to be reloaded or not used at all.
Second issue is that NEXTHDR\_DEST handling does not validate
that the options are present in skb->data, so we might read
garbage or access non existent memory.

net/sched: matchall: Fix configuration race
[ Upstream commit fd62d9f5c575f0792f150109f1fd24a0d4b3f854 ]
In the current version, the matchall internal state is split into two
structs: cls\_matchall\_head and cls\_matchall\_filter. This makes little
sense, as matchall instance supports only one filter, and there is no
situation where one exists and the other does not. In addition, that led
to some races when filter was deleted while packet was processed.
Unify that two structs into one, thus simplifying the process of matchall
creation and deletion. As a result, the new, delete and get callbacks have
a dummy implementation where all the work is done in destroy and change
callbacks, as was done in cls\_cgroup.

net/mlx5e: Fix update of hash function/key via ethtool
[ Upstream commit a100ff3eef193d2d79daf98dcd97a54776ffeb78 ]
Modifying TIR hash should change selected fields bitmask in addition to
the function and key.
Formerly, Only on ethool mlx5e\_set\_rxfh "ethtoo -X" we would not set this
field resulting in zeroing of its value, which means no packet fields are
used for RX RSS hash calculation thus causing all traffic to arrive in
RQ[0].
On driver load out of the box we don't have this issue, since the TIR
hash is fully created from scratch.
Tested:
ethtool -X ethX hkey
ethtool -X ethX hfunc
ethtool -X ethX equal

can: Fix kernel panic at security\_sock\_rcv\_skb
[ Upstream commit f1712c73714088a7252d276a57126d56c7d37e64 ]
Zhang Yanmin reported crashes [1] and provided a patch adding a
synchronize\_rcu() call in can\_rx\_unregister()
The main problem seems that the sockets themselves are not RCU
protected.
If CAN uses RCU for delivery, then sockets should be freed only after
one RCU grace period.
Recent kernels could use sock\_set\_flag(sk, SOCK\_RCU\_FREE), but let's
ease stable backports with the following fix instead.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-29 15:43:27 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of seq_file where an local attacker could create a situation in which an attacker could manipulate memory in which the function pointer to put() could be used for malicious purposes. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privledged escalation.  There are no exploits available for this flaw at this time.  Upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=77da160530dd1dc94f6ae15a981f24e5f0021e84>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c7)  Vladis Dronov    2017-02-09 13:26:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code which can trigger the flaw is not present in the products listed.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and MRG-2. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-04-11 11:48:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0892 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0892](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0892)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:31:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:1297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1297)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:41:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1298 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1298](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1298)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 15:39:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1308 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1308](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1308)   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also

sctp: avoid BUG\_ON on sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbufAlexander Popov reported that an application may trigger a BUG\_ON in
sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is
waiting on it to queue more data and meanwhile another thread peels off
the association being used by the first thread.
This patch replaces the BUG\_ON call with a proper error handling. It
will return -EPIPE to the original sendmsg call, similarly to what would
have been done if the association wasn't found in the first place.

In a default or common use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 this issue does not allow an unprivileged local user elevate their privileges on the system. In order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_RAW capability, which needs to be granted by the administrator to the attacker's account. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not have namespaces support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces feature to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.  So, this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 in the default configuration. Future updates for the respective releases will address this issue to secure non-default configurations.  In the non-default configuration mentioned above only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is vulnerable only to a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash, hence the impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is rated as being Moderate.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c9)  Martin Prpič    2017-05-11 07:09:15 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:31:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:1297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1297)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:42:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1298 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1298](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1298)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 15:46:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1308 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1308](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1308)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-19 04:48:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:1854 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1854](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1854)   ``` |  |

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
