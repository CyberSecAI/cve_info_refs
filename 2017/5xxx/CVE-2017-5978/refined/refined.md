Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5978:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `zzip_mem_entry_new` function within `memdisk.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `zzip_mem_entry_new` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application crash:** The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The crash can cause a denial of service by terminating the affected application. The Debian security advisory also notes the potential for arbitrary code execution if a malformed archive is processed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP Archive:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted or malformed ZIP archive is processed by the zziplib library.
- **`unzzipcat-mem` tool:** The provided ASan output shows the crash occurring when using the `unzzipcat-mem` tool, which utilizes the zziplib library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ZIP archive to a user or application that is using the vulnerable zziplib library.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- No specific position is mentioned in the available data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The vulnerable version is 0.13.62, and it was fixed in version 0.13.62-3+deb8u1 for Debian jessie and 0.13.62-3.1 for Debian stretch and sid.
- A reproducer is available on GitHub.
