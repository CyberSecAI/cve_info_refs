     "ATTACKER_CAPABILITIES": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify PDF, image and document files with malicious content and trick the user into opening such file using vulnerable software. They also need access to the file system where the software is installed or local network to perform DLL hijacking or other similar attacks.",
    "DETAILS": "The document details various security vulnerabilities found in multiple versions of Foxit products like Foxit Reader, PhantomPDF, and Foxit PDF SDK. The vulnerabilities include the following:\n\n*   **Use-After-Free:** Many instances where objects or memory are used after they have been freed, leading to crashes or remote code execution. These frequently occur when handling JavaScript, XFA forms, annotations, bookmarks, Doc objects, and other PDF elements. Specific examples include issues with checkbox objects, AcroForms, and the processing of annotation objects.\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Read/Write:** Multiple occurrences where the application reads or writes data outside the allocated memory space, leading to information disclosure, crashes, or remote code execution. This is observed in parsing JPEG2000, JP2, TIFF, BMP, and U3D files, handling certain JavaScript functions, and rendering images.\n*   **Type Confusion:** Vulnerabilities arising from the incorrect handling of object types, which could lead to crashes or remote code execution, often in JavaScript or XFA related contexts. This is shown when parsing certain types of objects such as Annotations or using JavaScript API calls.\n*   **Integer Overflow:** Issues where integer values overflow, resulting in incorrect calculations and subsequent memory access issues, potentially leading to crashes or remote code execution.\n*  **Null Pointer Dereference:** Many issues resulting from using null pointers without proper validation, frequently causing crashes or denial of service. These are often triggered when parsing specific PDF structures or handling JavaScript or malformed PDF files, XFA forms, or Annotation objects.\n*   **Heap Overflow/Stack Overflow**: The application fails to validate the size of a buffer that is allocated in the heap/stack leading to a buffer overflow that may lead to RCE. Issues frequently occur during handling JavaScripts or in other situations when performing specific PDF operations such as when parsing certain PDF files or converting to other document formats.\n*   **DLL Hijacking**: Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute malicious code by placing a malicious DLL in the search path when the application fails to properly specify a secure search path.\n*   **NTLM v2 Authentication Leak**: Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to steal NTLM v2 credentials when parsing specific types of content in PDF files. \n*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Deletion/Execution**: Application fails to validate file type leading to ability of creating, deleting, or executing arbitrary files via methods like exportDataObject, saveAs or submitForm.\n*  **Cross-Site Scripting**: Vulnerabilities when working with certain PDF files embedded with JavaScript, because of incomplete isolation of the JavaScript execution environment, allowing the JavaScript embedded in PDFs to be executed within the browser environment. \n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Vulnerabilities that allows attackers to perform privilege escalation attacks by loading malicious DLLs, calling outdated version of updater, or creating a junction to write an arbitrary file with full privileges.\n*   **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**: Vulnerabilities caused by the race condition when performing updates. The application may fail to lock the permissions of the update file after certificate validation, leading to privilege escalation attacks.\n*   **Side-Loading**: Vulnerability caused when the application fails to validate the integrity of the updater when running the update service, which may lead to running a malicious payload by replacing the update file.\n*   **Uninitialized Variable**: Vulnerabilities caused due to use of uninitialized variables when executing certain JavaScripts, leading to remote code execution or information disclosure.\n* **Incorrect Permission Assignment**: Vulnerabilities caused when the application fails to set correct permission for a folder which is used by the update service, leading to privilege escalation attacks.\n*  **Incomplete Certificate Check**: Vulnerabilities caused when the application fails to validate the certificate of the updater executable completely, leading to privilege escalation attacks.\n*  **Inadequate Permission Setting**: Vulnerabilities caused due to inadequate permission setting for a folder used during the installation process, leading to privilege escalation attacks."
