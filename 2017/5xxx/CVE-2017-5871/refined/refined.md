Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `error` and `redirect` URL parameters in the Odoo login and database selection pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Open Redirection:** The `redirect` parameter allows redirection to arbitrary URLs, including those outside the Odoo domain, without proper validation. The schema for the redirect is not restricted allowing non HTTP/HTTPS redirects.
2.  **Error Message Manipulation:** The `error` parameter allows for arbitrary content to be displayed, making social engineering and phishing attacks easier.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `redirect` parameter, when used with `data:text/html` scheme, leads to arbitrary Javascript execution in the context of the Odoo domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Open Redirection:** An attacker could use the open redirection to redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to credential theft or malware infection.
2.  **Error Message Manipulation:** Phishing attacks could be launched by using the error parameter, tricking users into providing credentials on a fake login page disguised as legitimate.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the Odoo interface, and the execution of malicious code within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** An attacker would craft a URL containing the vulnerable parameters (error or redirect) with malicious payloads and send it to a target user.
2.  **Social Engineering:** Attackers can leverage social engineering to trick users into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system and can be located anywhere with internet access.
2.  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `error` and `redirect` parameters and their lack of validation.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 8.0, 9, and 10 of Odoo.
