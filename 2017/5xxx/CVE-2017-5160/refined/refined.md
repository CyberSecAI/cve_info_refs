Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the software's failure to properly verify the peer's SSL certificate during a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. This lack of proper verification allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326): The software does not properly validate the SSL certificate of the peer it connects to via TLS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on communications and potentially intercept or modify data transmitted between the client and server. The impact is categorized as a loss of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the TLS connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept the network traffic. The attack requires low privileges (PR:L) because a valid user can initiate the connection with the vulnerable client. The attack also has a high attack complexity (AC:H) because the attacker needs to successfully intercept the network traffic and present a malicious SSL certificate to the client. User interaction is not required (UI:N) by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Wonderware InTouch Access Anywhere versions 11.5.2 and prior.
- Schneider Electric has released a patch (Wonderware InTouch Access Anywhere 2017 (17.0.0)) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
