Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5563:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `LZWEncode` function within `tif_lzw.c`. This occurs when processing a specially crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (crash) of the application processing the malformed TIFF.
- There is a possibility of arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application. This is mentioned in the Gentoo and Ubuntu security notices.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a specially crafted TIFF file.
- An attacker would need to entice a user or automated system to open the malicious TIFF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the targeted user/system.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `libtiff` versions prior to 4.0.8.
- A patch was created to address the issue, sanitizing the code to prevent reading past the initialized data, according to the bugzilla entry. However, the `bmp2tiff` utility, where the vulnerability was triggered, was removed upstream.
- The Ubuntu notice mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
