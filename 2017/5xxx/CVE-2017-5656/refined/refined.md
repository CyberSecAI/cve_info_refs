```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in how Apache CXF's STSClient caches tokens associated with delegation tokens. It extracts an identifier from the delegation token to associate it with the cached token. However, a weakness exists in this identifier extraction process.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Flawed token caching mechanism.
- Insecure identifier extraction from delegation tokens.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can craft a malicious delegation token that, when processed, will lead to the retrieval of a cached token intended for another user. This could allow an attacker to impersonate another user or gain access to resources they are not authorized to access.

Attack vectors: An attacker crafts a malicious delegation token and sends it to an Apache CXF endpoint acting as an intermediary.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send a crafted token to a vulnerable Apache CXF endpoint.
- No specific user interaction required, the attack can be automated.
