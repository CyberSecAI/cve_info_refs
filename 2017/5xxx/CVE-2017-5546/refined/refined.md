**Relevant Content:**

The provided content from git.kernel.org and github.com directly relates to CVE-2017-5546, describing a fix for a bug in the Linux kernel's SLAB freelist randomization code. The bugzilla.redhat.com entry confirms the CVE assignment and provides a brief description.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `freelist randomization code` within the `mm/slab.c` file. When a large random number is used, the freelist generation logic can introduce duplicate entries.

*   **Weakness:** The `next_random_slot` function does not properly handle cases where the position (`state->pos`) exceeds the count of available slots in the freelist.

*   **Impact:** Duplicate entries in the freelist lead to different allocations sharing the same memory chunk. This can cause:
    *   Odd program behavior
    *   System crashes

*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM` is enabled and a high random number is used during freelist initialization.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker does not directly control the random number generation. However, the likelihood of this issue occurring depends on the machine and its usage patterns. The vulnerability is more likely to manifest on systems that frequently allocate and deallocate SLAB objects, increasing the chances of a high random number being used.

**Technical Details:**

The core of the fix involves modifying the `next_random_slot` function in `mm/slab.c`:

```c
 static freelist_idx_t next_random_slot(union freelist_init_state *state)
 {
-       return (state->list[state->pos++] + state->rand) % state->count;
+       if (state->pos >= state->count)
+               state->pos = 0;
+       return state->list[state->pos++];
 }
```

The original code calculated the next random slot using modulo arithmetic (`% state->count`) *after* incrementing `state->pos`. If `state->pos` became equal to `state->count` due to the increment, subsequent accesses to `state->list[state->pos++]` would be out of bounds and the modulo wouldn't prevent the duplicate entries.

The fix adds a check to reset `state->pos` to 0 *before* accessing `state->list`, ensuring that `state->pos` always remains within the valid range of the list.
