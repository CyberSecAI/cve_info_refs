- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper or disabled TLS certificate validation within the mobile application. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to present a fraudulent TLS certificate that the application will accept.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate the TLS certificates of the servers it communicates with. This allows an attacker to intercept traffic by presenting a self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate, which the application accepts without proper verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intercept and potentially modify data transmitted between the application and the server. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information like usernames, passwords, authentication tokens and other personal information. Additionally, the attacker can potentially manipulate data sent back to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks. This typically requires the attacker to be on the same network as the victim, such as a public Wi-Fi network or a compromised local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the victim's device and the server. This can be done by being on the same Wi-Fi network, controlling a device on the same network, having privileged access to a VPN gateway or having control over the internet service provider's infrastructure. The attacker also needs the ability to generate a fraudulent TLS certificate.
