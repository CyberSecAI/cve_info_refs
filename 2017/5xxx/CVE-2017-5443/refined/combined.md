The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Networking
▾

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Cause of Bug
------------
Bug is present in below mentioned lines of ProcessNextState method in netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsBinHexDecoder.cpp file.
mName.BeginWriting()[mCount] = c;
if (++mCount > mName.Length())
{
...
DetectContentType(aRequest, mName);
Above if condition should also check whether "++mCount" is equal to mName.Length(). Otherwise "mName.BeginWriting()[mCount] = c;" will write a character to string terminating null value.

My $.02 here: we should just disable this decoder or at least fuzz it extensively.

[0001-bug-1342661-out-of-bounds-check-before-assigning-r.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8843938&action=diff) (obsolete)

[This problem seems to have existed since at least this commit: <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/194b881050ac> (August 2009) - which modified the range check from the previous version, but it may have existed before that. I didn't research the previous logic.]
The question I've not really worked out for myself is weather we should error out completely on this condition or if we only should ignore the specific bad write. The patch I'm attaching here does the latter since it is the least invasive change that should still avoid the bad assign.
If I got this right, the trailing-zero overwrite is more or less done on purpose since the binhex format is supposed to end the file name with a zero byte so the original code from before 2009 that didn't use a nsCString string had to zero terminate the string. The mistake was to assume that there would always be a zero byte in the source.
Thoughts?

Sure I can put up a dumb fuzzer tonight targeting "application/mac-binhex40". Should I add any other content types to the list? Keep in mind this will be very dumb for the time being.Flags: needinfo?(twsmith)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The patch looks good. Thanks for fixing this.
It's funny that this code was dependent on a non-zero uninitialized value for so long. But then again mac-binhex40 probably isn't that common.

v2-0001-bug-1342661-boundary-check-before-assigning-r-val.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It easy to figure out how to do an out of bounds write, making an exploit out if it is slightly trickier but probably not terribly complicated.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
It is \*only\* an added boundary check so even with no added comments it may trigger some people's interest.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All. The bug has been around since a long time, but happens easier since [bug 1276625](/show_bug.cgi?id=1276625 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Static Analysis][Uninitialized pointer field] In constructor nsBinHexDecoder") was fixed in version 49.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The same patch is likely to work on all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I estimate a very low risk. It is only a single added boundary check.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1443301#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2017-04-19 05:42:41 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

The following testcase crashes the latest ASAN build of Firefox (BuildID=20170313233726).
<script>

o233=(new DOMParser()).parseFromString("<div><div>","text/html");
o236=o233.all[2];
o256=o233.all[3];
o256.appendChild(o51);
document.replaceChild(o233.documentElement,document.documentElement);
document.documentElement.appendChild(o151);
o151.contentWindow.onresize=fun0;
document.documentElement.replaceWith(o236,"x");
}
function fun0 () {

o51.innerHTML="<marquee>><p><ul id='id56'>";
document.documentElement.setAttribute('aria-owns','id56');
setTimeout("location.reload()", 100);

from what I can tell it is another broken tree problem, so no - answering your original question. So not yet clear, whether this is indexes problem or parent-child relashinship.Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

Attached patch

[stop bleeding](attachment.cgi?id=8850658&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8850658&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1347075&attachment=8850658)

A broken tree problem: accessible tree is out of sync with DOM tree, i.e. 'origContainer' contains 'child' and 'prevChild' on DOM level as children, but 'prevChild' has parents before 'origContainer'.
More debugging is required to figure out how we've got a broken tree. In the meantime we can have a crash stopper fix, which can be safely backported.Assignee: nobody → surkov.alexander

stop bleeding
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? not easy, quite likely the fuzzing is needed
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? no tests, commit message is "validate insertion index for a child move"
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? no info, presumably the problem is old enough to affect all branches
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? same patch should work
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? not likely, just a correction of broken accessible tree, it shouldn't make thing worse

This needs a security rating before it can receive sec-approval. I don't understand the security implications of the problem. Can you explain them at all?

The landed patch is a bleed stopper only, a follow-up fix is required to fix the root issue. How is it better to proceed? Should I file a follow up bug for easier this sec bug tracking?

This didn't happen. It looks like this is going to miss the Firefox 53 release (and associated ESR branches). Is that on purpose?Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

Reproduced the initial issue using the build and the script given in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1347075#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - negative size memmove in mozilla::a11y::Accessible::InsertChildAt") and having domfuzz\_helper extension installed.

Also, using 54.0b1 (20170418132012) and 53.0 (20170418101543) latest linux64-asan-debug builds, the crash isn't reproducible anymore, but Firefox becomes totally unresponsive.
I wasn't able to verify the fix on firefox-esr45 and firefox-esr52 asan builds, because domfuzz\_helper extension is not compatible with these builds.Flags: needinfo?(nils)

weird, did you have a chance to test the latest nightlies (20170418 seems out of date)? Is the stack same? Could you give a link to crash stats please?
btw, what [bug 1385372](/show_bug.cgi?id=1385372 "RESOLVED FIXED - memmove negative-size-param in [@mozilla::a11y::HyperTextAccessible::InsertChildAt]") (a 'see also' from the previous comment) is about? it seems I'm not authorized for it.

Investigated again this issue using
- 52.3.0esr (20170803170140) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
- 55.0 (20170803173024) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
- 56.0b1 (20170804101649) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
- 57.0a1 (20170803031846) linux64-fuzzing-asan-opt build
on Ubuntu 16.04 x64
and the crash scenario from the [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1347075#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - negative size memmove in mozilla::a11y::Accessible::InsertChildAt") is not to reproducible anymore. But Firefox becomes unresponsive on the esr build.

It is weird that esr only is affected. Any chance to make a perf profile?Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

Back with more investigation details. Used Ubuntu 16.04 x64 and:
- 52.4.1esr (20170928162237) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
- 58.0a1 (20170929094722) linux64-fuzzing-asan-opt build
- 57.0b4 (20170929070024) linux64-fuzzing-asan-opt build
- 56.0.1 (20170928154249) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
Following the scenario from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1347075#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - negative size memmove in mozilla::a11y::Accessible::InsertChildAt"), these are the results:
- the esr build crashes, but I am unable to access the about:crashes page to get the crash report details and also, the performance profile recording couldn't be saved
- the Nightly and the Beta builds work ok
- the Release build gets unresponsive, but I was still able so save the performance recording profile.
Here you have the profile recordings for Nightly, Beta and esr builds <https://goo.gl/UmPyW7>.
Hope that these will help.Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

I managed to open perf profiles in devtools, but they didn't provide much: no stacks, all I can see is which module takes what time. Was that Gecko perf profiling (<https://perf-html.io/>)?
On the other hand, if esr and release builds are effected only, then anyways we might be not allowed to land a patch (we landed a whole bunch of changes into 57 and most of them are perf related). We probably should get a pre thumbs up from the risk management team, before digging into the problem any further.
I wonder whether the esr52 crash is a crash of this bug or something else, or even somehow connected with the hangs you observe. Is my understanding correct that the about:crashes is empty when you reopen the browser?Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

I used the Firefox Developer Tools Performance tool <https://developer.mozilla.org/son/docs/Tools/Performance>, but I will start over again the investigation and use the tool that you indicated.

No, simply I am unable to access the about:crashes page using the esr build indicated in the [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1347075#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - negative size memmove in mozilla::a11y::Accessible::InsertChildAt") (see <https://goo.gl/KBxCe2>).

Repeated the investigation for the problematic builds:
- 56.0.1 (20171004100747) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
- 52.4.1esr (20171004174042) linux64-asan-debug build with domfuzz\_helper extension installed
The esr build crashes right after the Gecko perf profiling add-on installation is finished. And the about:crashes page is still unreachable.
Here is the performance recording profile for the release build <https://goo.gl/t6mU25>.Flags: needinfo?(surkov.alexander)

ouch, it's weird, you may want to poke around to see if anyone has ideas on it

Thank you. Btw, the most convenient way for both of us is to share a link on a profile, see [1] for instructions, but before we go any further, we probably should doublecheck whether this is something worth to continue to investigate, since release build is affected only, and I have doubts that a patch will be accepted even if we had it. We still are faced to huge performance problems on Nightly.
