Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability in GeniXCMS, as described in the github issue and blog post:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the `posts.control.php` file and the `$_POST['recipient']` parameter in `options.php` file are directly inserted into SQL queries, making them vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to unsanitized user inputs being used in SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The code fails to validate or sanitize user-provided data before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete existing database records.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the database server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** In some cases, depending on the database configuration, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the server via SQL injection.
* The provided exploit in the content uses `updatexml` function to retrieve data, indicating blind SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The `id` parameter in the URL for `posts.control.php` is vulnerable.
*   **HTTP POST Parameter Manipulation:** The `recipient` parameter in the POST request for `options.php` is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GeniXCMS application.
*   **Basic Web Application and SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how HTTP requests work and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided examples do not indicate a requirement for authentication. This suggests that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability without being authenticated.
    
**Specific Vulnerable Code Snippets:**

1.  **/inc/lib/Control/Backend/posts.control.php:**

    ```php
    $data['post'] = Db::result("SELECT * FROM `posts` WHERE `id` = '{$_GET['id']}' ");
    ```
2.  **/inc/mod/newsletter/options.php:**

    ```php
    $usr = Db::result("SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE `group` = '{$_POST['recipient']}'");
    ```
    
**Exploitation Examples:**

*   **Issue 1 (posts.control.php):**

    ```
    http://lemon.love/code-src/GeniXCMS/GeniXCMS-master/gxadmin/index.php?page=posts&act=edit&id=6' and updatexml(1,(select user()),1)%23&token=Pp52R3oD4wuLBVutgD9hMsMrp8alQD3bKmuf06AI0HZMzoMiRe3s18BUa4eIOqrMqj38Cp9aoQqWaw10
    ```

*   **Issue 2 (options.php):**

    ```
    POST /code-src/GeniXCMS/GeniXCMS-master/gxadmin/index.php?page=mods&mod=newsletter HTTP/1.1
