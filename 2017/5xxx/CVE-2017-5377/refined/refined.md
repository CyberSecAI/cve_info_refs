Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Skia, the graphics library used by Firefox, handles transformations when creating gradients. Specifically, the issue occurs in `SkLinearGradient::LinearGradientContext::shade4_dx_clamp`. When a non-finite (e.g., infinite or NaN) transform is used to create a gradient, it can lead to out-of-bounds memory access within the `sk_memset32` function, resulting in a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write caused by a lack of validation of the input transforms when creating gradient contexts. This occurs when `sk_memset32` attempts to write to memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption, which can cause the program to crash or potentially be exploited further.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash/Denial of Service:** The most immediate impact is a crash of the browser, which leads to a denial-of-service condition for the user.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, memory corruption vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks, such as arbitrary code execution if an attacker has precise control over the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Content:**  An attacker can craft malicious web content (HTML/CSS) that includes a gradient with non-finite transformations. When a vulnerable Firefox version renders this content, it triggers the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious web content to the victim's browser, either through a website, an advertisement, or another method.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The exploit can occur automatically when the vulnerable browser loads the malicious content; no user interaction beyond visiting the page is required.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found by Atte Kettunen and reported externally.
- The fix was backported from upstream Skia and involves checking for finite transforms when creating gradient contexts.
- The fix was applied to Firefox 51, 52, and Aurora.
- Firefox 49 and 50 were deemed affected but were not patched, making them vulnerable if used. ESR45 was unaffected.
- The fix was also tested by Mozilla's QA team.
- The issue was resolved by ensuring that non-finite transforms are handled correctly during the creation of Skia gradient contexts.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a `sec-critical` issue.
