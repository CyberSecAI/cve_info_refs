# Chromium, Google Chrome: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Chromium and Google
Chrome, the worst of which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **62.0.3202.62** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **62.0.3202.62** |

| Package | **www-client/google-chrome** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **62.0.3202.62** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **62.0.3202.62** |

### Background

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer,
faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

Google Chrome is one fast, simple, and secure browser for all your
devices

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and Google
Chrome. Please review the referenced CVE identifiers and Google Chrome
Releases for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, bypass
content security controls, or conduct URL spoofing.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/chromium-62.0.3202.62"

```

All Google Chrome users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/google-chrome-62.0.3202.62"

```

Package        : libxml2
Version        : 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9318 CVE-2017-5130 CVE-2017-5969 CVE-2017-16932
                 CVE-2022-23308

Five security issues have been discovered in libxml2: XML C parser and toolkit.

CVE-2016-9318

    Vulnerable versions do not offer a flag directly indicating that the current
    document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it
    easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via
    a crafted document.

CVE-2017-5130

    Integer overflow in memory debug code, allowed a remote attacker to
    potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted XML file.

CVE-2017-5969

    Parser in a recover mode allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted XML document.

CVE-2017-16932

    When expanding a parameter entity in a DTD, infinite recursion could lead to
    an infinite loop or memory exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23308

    the application that validates XML using xmlTextReaderRead() with
    XML_PARSE_DTDATTR and XML_PARSE_DTDVALID  enabled becomes vulnerable to this
    use-after-free bug. This issue can result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, October 17, 2017

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 62 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 62.0.3202.62 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/61.0.3163.100..62.0.3202.62?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 62.

Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [35](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-0-M62) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[775550](https://crbug.com/775550)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
