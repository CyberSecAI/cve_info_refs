{
  "CVE-2017-5393": {
    "Description": "The `mozAddonManager` allows for the installation of extensions from the CDN for addons.mozilla.org, a publicly accessible site. This could allow malicious extensions to install additional extensions from the CDN in combination with an XSS attack on Mozilla AMO sites.",
    "Root cause": "The `mozAddonManager` API was whitelisting addons.mozilla.org CDN for extension installation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure whitelisting of a publicly accessible CDN for extension installation."
     ],
    "Impact": "A malicious extension, in combination with an XSS vulnerability on Mozilla AMO (addons.mozilla.org), could install additional extensions without user consent.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "XSS on Mozilla AMO sites.",
       "Malicious WebExtension using mozAddonManager API."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to inject and execute malicious code on a Mozilla AMO site through an XSS vulnerability.",
        "Ability to create a malicious web extension."
    ]
  },
    "CVE-2017-5392": {
    "Description": "Weak proxy objects have weak references on multiple threads when they should only have them on one, resulting in incorrect memory usage and corruption, which leads to potentially exploitable crashes. Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.",
    "Root cause": "Weak proxy objects had weak references on multiple threads instead of a single thread which leads to memory corruption and potentially exploitable crashes.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Incorrect handling of weak references in a multi-threaded environment.",
            "Lack of thread safety with weak proxy objects."
        ],
        "Impact": "Memory corruption and potentially exploitable crashes.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Exploitation of the race condition during access of weak proxy objects by multiple threads.",
             "Triggering the use-after-free scenario with weak references on multiple threads."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": [
            "Ability to control or influence the timing of operations on multiple threads.",
            "Ability to trigger the race condition."
        ]
