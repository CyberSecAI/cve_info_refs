Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5847:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `gst_asf_demux_process_ext_content_desc` function in the `asfdemux` element of the GStreamer "ugly" plugins.
- Specifically, the function reads data from a buffer without properly checking if sufficient data is available, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds heap read:** The code attempts to read 4 bytes using `GST_READ_UINT32_LE` from a provided data buffer (`value`) without ensuring that `value_len` is at least 4 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash of the application using GStreamer by providing a malformed ASF file.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While the provided information primarily indicates an out-of-bounds read leading to a crash, such vulnerabilities could, under certain conditions, be leveraged for more serious exploits like arbitrary code execution. This is mentioned in the Debian Security Advisory, implying it is a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted ASF file:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted ASF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read during the parsing of extended content descriptors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply input to GStreamer:** The attacker needs a way to feed the malformed ASF file to an application or system using the vulnerable GStreamer plugin. This could involve tricking a user into opening the file locally or targeting an automated system processing media files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified through AddressSanitizer (ASan) during fuzzing.
- The fix involves adding length checks before parsing the bool/uint extended content descriptors.
- The vulnerability is present in GStreamer versions prior to 1.10.3 and 0.10.19-2.1+deb8u1.

The fix was implemented in commit `d21017b52a585f145e8d62781bcc1c5fefc7ee37` which adds checks to ensure that there is enough data available before parsing the boolean/uint extended content descriptors.
