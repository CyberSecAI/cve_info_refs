# The existence of a weblate account is guessable (CVE-2017-5537) #1317

## Description

[![@jelly](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67428?u=cc677701e49dca0be4cdc6ea10bc60b52a181e4e&v=4&size=48)](/jelly)[jelly](https://github.com/jelly)opened [on Jan 9, 2017](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/1317#issue-199521961)
### Steps to reproduce

1. Login to weblate with a valid email, but wrong password

### Actual behaviour

Weblate displays: "User with this email address was not found."

### Expected behaviour

Weblate displays: "Invalid password or username / email address"

Displaying that a user with this email address is not found, makes it possible to do user enumeration to figure out if an account exists. Since dumps of password / email address are widely available and password re-use is a thing, displaying if an account is on the server is a valid thread.

The login form also does not seem to implement any rate-limiting which makes it easy to bruteforce.

### Server configuration

Standard.

Use CVE-2017-5537.

The scope of this CVE does not include the issues/1317 comment of "The
login form also does not seem to implement any rate-limiting which
makes it easy to bruteforce."
