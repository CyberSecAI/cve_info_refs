Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect naming of veth (virtual Ethernet) pairs used by Nova-LXD to connect LXD containers to the Neutron network. Specifically, the `host_name` parameter in the LXD network device configuration was not being set correctly in older versions (Mitaka), causing Neutron security group rules not to be applied correctly to the containers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect veth Pair Naming:** Nova-LXD was not properly naming the host-side interface of the veth pair used to connect LXD containers to the Neutron network bridge.
*   **Bypass of Security Group Rules:** Due to the incorrect naming, the iptables rules generated by Neutron for security groups were not being applied to the network traffic of LXD containers. Neutron rules are created based on tap device names, which are not used by nova-lxd.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unintended Network Access:** The primary impact was that network traffic to and from LXD containers could bypass configured security group rules. This could allow unintended access to LXD instances over the network, potentially exposing them to external threats or unauthorized lateral movement within a network.
*  **Security Group Rules Not Enforced**: Security group rules, which are designed to filter network traffic, were not being applied to the LXD containers, leaving them vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Exploitation:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by targeting LXD containers that were not properly secured by Neutron security group rules. Since traffic bypasses the security rules, this means an attacker can send network traffic to LXD containers that would normally be blocked.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If an attacker gained access to one container, the lack of proper security group enforcement could make it easier to move laterally to other containers in the same network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers would need network connectivity to the affected LXD containers.
*   **Awareness of Vulnerability:** Attackers need to be aware of this vulnerability to take advantage of it.
*   **No Privileged Access Initially Required**: The attacker does not need any initial privileged access to cause this issue, as the vulnerability exists because of a configuration issue

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability primarily affected Nova-LXD deployments using veth pairs to plumb instances to neutron bridge (xenial/mitaka), specifically versions prior to 13.1.1.
*  **Mitigation:** The fix involves correctly setting the `host_name` parameter when creating network devices in LXD containers. This fix aligns with how Neutron expects interface names to match its security rules.
*   **Fix Details:** The fix was implemented by backporting the 'host\_name' usage from later versions, which ensures that the host part of the veth pair used to connect LXD containers into neutron has the correct naming.
*  **Manual Updates:** Existing instances require manual updates to apply the fix because the code changes do not automatically update the host veth name for existing instances. The command used for this manual update is `lxd profile edit <instancename>`.
*   **Patch:** The patch is available as `xenial-fixes.patch` and a commit 1b76cefb92081efa1e88cd8f330253f857028bd2.

In summary, CVE-2017-5936 highlights a critical vulnerability in Nova-LXD where misconfiguration of veth pair naming led to a bypass of Neutron security group rules, potentially exposing LXD containers to unauthorized network access.
