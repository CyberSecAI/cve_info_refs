#### Break

Breaking things is the first stage in discovering weaknessess, we always "trust" but first we need to "verify", how? by breaking!.

#### Harden

We successfully broke it during the verification process? No problem, now it's our turn to harden it to make it stronger than ever.

#### Repeat

Repeating the previous process with different methodologies to ensure that neither us nor anyone else can break it in the future.

#### What else?

Security is never a mission to be accomplished, security is an endless process involves breaking, hardening, verifying and trusting.

Hi, I’m Seif Elsallamy a bug hunter from Seekurity Team, Today i will show you a critical reflected Cross Site Scripting bug affecting mail.ru and could be used as an [XSS worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_%28computer_worm%29)but first let’s dive into some general information.

## **What is mail.ru?**

[mail.ru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru) is a Russian mailing services like yahoo, hotmail and gmail.

Mail.Ru Group, ООО (commonly referred to as Mail.Ru) is a Russian Internet company. It was started in 1998 as an e-mail service and went on to become a major corporate figure in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet. As of 2013 according to comScore, websites owned by Mail.ru collectively had the largest audience in Russia and captured the most screen time. Mail.Ru’s sites reach approximately 86% of Russian Internet users on a monthly basis and the company is in the top 5 of largest Internet companies, based on the number of total pages viewed. Mail.ru controls the 3 largest Russian social networking sites. It operates the second and third most popular Russian social networking sites, Odnoklassniki and Moi Mir, respectively. Mail.ru holds 100% of shares of Russia’s most popular social network VKontakte and minority stakes in Qiwi, formerly OE Investments (15.04%). It also operates two instant messaging networks (Mail.Ru Agent and ICQ), an e-mail service and Internet portal Mail.ru, as well as a number of online games.

## **What is Cross-site scripting AKA XSS? And why ours is stored?**

[Cross-site scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29) simply is a security bug that may affect websites allowing users (Attackers) to inject scripts (javascript) to another users (Victims) to modify or steal there data as example, session emails passwords page content. Stored Cross-site scripting is an XSS type which if successfully injected it will be stored permanently in the application’s database and retrieved whenever the user call back a vulnerable page calling this stored payload

## What is eml files?

Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise, Microsoft Outlook Express, Lotus notes, Windows Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Postbox. .eml files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.

Now lets back to mail.ru bug….

Mail.ru is parsing .eml files  and fetches the “subject” automatically then reflecting it in the email subject without sanitizing, filtering or validating it for malicious content which was the main root cause for our  Stored XSS to occur.

So to reproduce this behavior, We simply created a new eml file “test.eml”, Edited this file and included a simple XSS payload ie. “subject : <script>alert(“XSS”);</script>” then we saved the file, After that we went to we navigated to “m.mail.ru” (the mobile version of mail.ru), Created a new mail, uploaded the eml file and then we hit “send”

Once a victim receive our malicious message, Opening it, you will find this lovely and cute popup alert box with word “XSS” inside it which mean that the script has been executed so that’s mean XSS occurs.

## Impact of a simple attack scenario:

Imagine that an XSS work behavior which spreads over your mail.ru contacts, send the same malicious message to all of your contact with a JS execution of stealing user’s session and act on behalf of the currently logged in user! And possibilities are endless here.

## **PoC Video:**

We responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Mail.ru through their [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/116570) bug bounty program and they fixed it and rewarded us with a generous bounty, Thanks Mail.ru

Hi Guys,

I hope you all are fine and doing well. Yes you read it right, We managed to find a vulnerability in a framework used to exploit vulnerabilities! “Today is me tomorrow will be you” 🙂

Today we will talk about a CSRF vulnerability affects the web application of both versions (Express, Community and Professional) of Metasploit Project.

But first what is Metasploit? (Seriously maybe somebody out there don’t know about it yet :D)

> The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.
>
> Its best-known sub-project is the open source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.
>
> The Metasploit Project is well known for its anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework.
>
> Metasploit was created by H. D. Moore in 2003 as a portable network tool using Perl. By 2007, the Metasploit Framework had been completely rewritten in Ruby. On October 21, 2009, the Metasploit Project announced that it had been acquired by Rapid7, a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions.
>
> Like comparable commercial products such as Immunity’s Canvas or Core Security Technologies’ Core Impact, Metasploit can be used to test the vulnerability of computer systems or to break into remote systems. Like many information security tools, Metasploit can be used for both legitimate and unauthorized activities. Since the acquisition of the Metasploit Framework, Rapid7 has added two open core proprietary editions called Metasploit Express and Metasploit Pro.
>
> Metasploit’s emerging position as the de facto exploit development framework led to the release of software vulnerability advisories often accompanied by a third party Metasploit exploit module that highlights the exploitability, risk and remediation of that particular bug. Metasploit 3.0 began to include fuzzing tools, used to discover software vulnerabilities, rather than just exploits for known bugs. This avenue can be seen with the integration of the lorcon wireless (802.11) toolset into Metasploit 3.0 in November 2006. Metasploit 4.0 was released in August 2011.

This CSRF vulnerability can be used to perform an attack against all the running “Scans and Tasks” by metasploit project.

> When we discovered this issue we’ve called it “The metasploit firewall”, So funny isn’t it! But why? If you hosted a page with the blew proof of concept code on your local/ web server index you will be tricking Metasploit scanning session to load this page (of course to scan it) hence kill all the running tasks. A firewall? hmmm kind of!
>
> (**Update**: We thought it might be a valid attack vector but after some investigations it turned to be not because the crawler used by metasploit is not authenticated with the metasploit session itself)

**Usability issue**: There have to be an option to resume the stopped tasks to not to lose it at all after performing such attack.

Metasploit team comment about the issue:

> CVE-2017-5244 (CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery): Metasploit commercial editions allowed GET requests to the stop and stop\_all (task) routes. This should not have been the case, as they change the state of the service, and should have been only allowed through POST requests. In addition, the origin of the requests was not verified until after processing. This could have allowed an attacker to stop one, or all, Metasploit tasks by getting an authenticated user to run JavaScript (e.g. via loading a malicious URL). Now the routes are only exposed to POST requests, which validate the presence of a secret token to prevent CSRF attacks (via Rails’ protect\_from\_forgery). This vulnerability was kindly reported to Rapid7 by Mohamed A. Baset (Founder and Cyber Security Advisor at Seekurity.com SAS de C.V. Mexico; @SymbianSyMoh).

Rapid7 made a public advisory with more technical details you can read about it here: <https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2017/06/14/r7-2017-16-cve-2017-5244-lack-of-csrf-protection-for-stopping-tasks-in-metasploit-pro-express-and-community-editions-fixed>

And here is our advisory details:

## **# Exploit Title:**

Metasploit Web Project Kill all running tasks CSRF

## **# Date reported:**

27-5-2017

## **# Exploit Author:**

Seekurity SAS de C.V. – Mohamed Abdelbasset Elnouby (@SymbianSyMoh)

## **# Vendor Homepage:**

http://www.metasploit.com/

## **# Software Link:**

https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download/editions/

## **# Affected Versions:**

Express, Community and Pro < 4.14.0 (Update 2017051801)

## **# CVE number:**

CVE-2017-5244

## Vulnerability:

Cross Site Request Forgery – (CSRF) / Improper Anti-CSRF token validation

## Vulnerability reference**:**

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site\_Request\_Forgery\_(CSRF)

## **Video PoC:**

## **Impact:**

After doing some research, i have found that the anti csrf token “authenticity\_token” value is not validated from the local server side which will result in a csrf attack and kills all the currently running metasploit tasks (with no ability to resume).

## **Attack vectors:**

Attackers can target a local metasploit user and use the PoC code to stop/kill all the running metasploit tasks, or by other MITM tricks like injecting the PoC code into the network traffic which will cause the same exact impact.

## **PoC Code:**

`<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

<title>Metsploit Asset Firewall - Kill all running tasks bug PoC</title>

</head>

<h1>Metsploit Asset Firewall - Kill all running tasks bug PoC by Mohamed A. Baset - @Seekurity</h1>
