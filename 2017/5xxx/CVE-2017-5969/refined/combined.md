| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c0)  Henri Salo    2017-02-12 07:27:22 UTC  ``` <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/05/3>  Btw. latest releases are missing from the version list in bugzilla. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c1)  Henri Salo    2017-02-13 04:39:25 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-5969 has been assigned to this issue by MITRE. Their comments below:  This appears to be a valid vulnerability but we do not consider "Someone runs xmllint --recover crash-libxml2-recover.xml" a valid attack vector. With that attack vector, an end user experiences a loss of functionality after the xmllint command-line tool crashes with a NULL pointer dereference (because the end user can completely work around this by not repeating the specific command-line invocation, there would be no security impact).  The security problem is that xmlSaveDoc (shown in the <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/05/3> post) is a supported part of the libxml2 API. At least in theory, any arbitrary application may choose to call xmlSaveDoc, and the NULL pointer dereference could be a remote denial of service for that application.  The <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/05/3> post also mentions "It is interesting to note that the developers of libxml2 strongly recommend not to use recover mode to parse untrusted inputs." As far as we can tell, the affected code for this vulnerability is reachable even when "recover mode" is not used. The "recover mode" option primarily affects the code behavior within the parser.c file. As shown in the <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/05/3> post, none of the parser.c code is called during processing of the input in question. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c2)  Kostya Serebryany    2017-02-15 05:56:06 UTC  ``` Smaller repro: <!DOCTYPE[<!ELEMENT d(a,()> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c3)  dmoppert    2017-02-22 06:26:09 UTC  ``` Not sure if I agree with MITRE's assessment here.  As far as I can tell, the null ptr dereference in xmlSaveDoc is only possible when it is called with a non-well-formed xmlDocPtr.  Such an xmlDocPtr will only be constructed by libxml's parsers if XML_PARSE_RECOVER is set.  As noted in the original report, it is "strongly recommended not to use" XML_PARSE_RECOVER for any applications parsing untrusted input.  Thus, for an application to be vulnerable it would have to be modifying parts of the xmlDocPtr structure directly in a dangerous way prior to calling xmlSaveDoc.  In particular, the final statement is false:  > none of the parser.c code is called during processing of the input in question.  This can be trivially verified by running the reproducer in gdb, with a breakpoint on xmlDoParse, and seeing that ctxt->options&XML_PARSE_RECOVER and ctxt->recovery are set.   I think that an application calling xmlSaveDoc() with a malformed document structure constitutes API abuse, and probably doesn't warrant a CVE. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c4)  David Kilzer    2017-04-09 03:47:26 UTC  ``` This is also a dupe of:  [Bug 758422](show_bug.cgi?id=758422 "RESOLVED FIXED"): xmllint: null ptr deref + segfault in xmlDumpElementContent at valid.c:1181 <[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=758422](show_bug.cgi?id=758422 "RESOLVED FIXED")>  I'm pretty sure the patch on that bug will fix this issue. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c5)  David Kilzer    2017-04-09 03:50:22 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 758422](show_bug.cgi?id=758422 "RESOLVED FIXED") *** ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c6)  Daniel Veillard    2017-04-09 16:00:44 UTC  ``` And I would disagree of a CVE with the Recover parsing option which should only be used for manual recovery at least for XML parser.  Daniel ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c7)  ncopa    2017-04-13 08:52:14 UTC  ``` I don't have access to [bug 758422](show_bug.cgi?id=758422 "RESOLVED FIXED").

Thanks! ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=778519#c8)  Nick Wellnhofer    2017-06-07 18:12:05 UTC  ``` Fixed with the following commit:  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=94691dc884d1a8ada39f073408b4bb92fe7fe882> ``` |  |

Package        : libxml2
Version        : 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9318 CVE-2017-5130 CVE-2017-5969 CVE-2017-16932
                 CVE-2022-23308

Five security issues have been discovered in libxml2: XML C parser and toolkit.

CVE-2016-9318

    Vulnerable versions do not offer a flag directly indicating that the current
    document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it
    easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via
    a crafted document.

CVE-2017-5130

    Integer overflow in memory debug code, allowed a remote attacker to
    potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted XML file.

CVE-2017-5969

    Parser in a recover mode allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted XML document.

CVE-2017-16932

    When expanding a parameter entity in a DTD, infinite recursion could lead to
    an infinite loop or memory exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23308

    the application that validates XML using xmlTextReaderRead() with
    XML_PARSE_DTDATTR and XML_PARSE_DTDVALID  enabled becomes vulnerable to this
    use-after-free bug. This issue can result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>

# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201711-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libxml2, the worst of
which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.4-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.4-r3** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libxml2. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML
document, could remotely execute arbitrary code, conduct XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.4-r3"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

Subject: CVE request: Null pointer derefence parsing xml file using libxml
 2.9.4 (in recover mode)

Hi,

We found a null pointer dereference when parsing a xml file using recover
mode. It was tested in libxml 2.9.4 (ArchLinux x86_64). To reproduce:

$ xmllint --recover crash-libxml2-recover.xml

==27646==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000

    #13 0x4032b9 in _start
(/home/g/Work/Code/libxml2-2.9.4/xmllint+0x4032b9)

A reproducer is attached. It is interesting to note that the developers of
libxml2 strongly recommend not to use recover mode to parse untrusted
inputs. Please assign a CVE if suitable.

Regards,
Gustavo.
