Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper authentication of replicated HTTP requests in a clustered Apache NiFi environment. When an anonymous user's request is replicated to another node in the cluster, the originating node's identity was being used instead of the anonymous user's identity. This led to incorrect authorization checks on the receiving node.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Identity Propagation:** The primary weakness is that the identity of the originating node, rather than the actual anonymous user, was being used during request replication. This bypassed intended access restrictions for anonymous users.
- **Missing Authentication Check:** The code lacked a proper check for anonymous users when building the proxy chain, causing the incorrect identity to be used in the replicated request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Authorization:** Exploitation would lead to incorrect authorization decisions on replicated requests. An anonymous user could potentially gain access to resources or perform actions that should only be accessible to authenticated users or users with specific privileges.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, the vulnerability could allow an anonymous user to gain privileges or access to data they would not normally have, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Replicated HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP request to a NiFi cluster where the cluster nodes replicate requests.
- **Anonymous User:** The vulnerability specifically impacts requests made by anonymous (unauthenticated) users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access to NiFi Cluster:** The attacker must have network access to a NiFi cluster.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a NiFi cluster.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user; this vulnerability specifically concerns anonymous users.
