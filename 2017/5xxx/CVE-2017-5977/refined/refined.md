Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5977:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is an invalid memory read in the `zzip_mem_entry_extra_block` function within the `memdisk.c` file of the zziplib library. This function is responsible for processing extra data blocks within a ZIP archive's entry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Read:** The code attempts to read from an address that is not within allocated memory, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the application using zziplib, causing a denial of service. The program terminates with a segmentation fault and aborts, as demonstrated by the provided ASan output.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ZIP Archive:** The attack vector is a crafted ZIP archive containing specially formed extra data blocks that triggers the vulnerable code path. The provided reproducer on GitHub is a sample file that triggers the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious zip file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted zip file to a user or application that processes the zip using the vulnerable version of `zziplib`.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `zzip_mem_entry_extra_block` function, specifically at line 248 of `/tmp/portage/dev-libs/zziplib-0.13.62-r1/work/zziplib-0.13.62/zzip/memdisk.c`
*   The crash is triggered by `unzzipcat-mem` when processing the crafted zip file.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASan) output shows a SEGV (segmentation violation) when trying to read from memory address 0x603000014e32. The crash happens while executing the `zzip_mem_entry_extra_block` function that is called by `zzip_mem_entry_new` which is part of `zzip_mem_disk_load` -> `zzip_mem_disk_open` which is finally called by `main` function of `unzzipcat-mem` utility.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
*   The affected version is zziplib 0.13.62.
