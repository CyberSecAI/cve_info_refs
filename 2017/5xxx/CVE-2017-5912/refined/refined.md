The provided content discusses a vulnerability related to improper TLS certificate validation in various iOS applications, including "FOREXTrader for iPhone" which is associated with CVE-2017-5912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of the affected applications to properly validate TLS certificates presented by servers. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to use self-signed or invalid certificates that would normally be rejected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper TLS certificate validation. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and potentially modify data transmitted between the app and the legitimate server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   Interception of sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and other authentication tokens.
*   Potential manipulation of data sent to the application.
*   Unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker intercepts network traffic between the vulnerable application and its server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic. This can be achieved by:
*   Being physically proximate to the user on the same Wi-Fi network.
*   Having control of a device connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
*   Having access to the VPN gateway the user is connected to.
*   Compromising an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**Specific information for CVE-2017-5912 ("FOREXTrader for iPhone"):**
*   Affected versions: 2.9.12 through 2.9.14
*   Vulnerable endpoint: prodweb2.efxnow.com
*   Data at risk: Username and password.
*   Status: Not yet fixed

The article also explains the mechanics of a man-in-the-middle attack and how TLS certificates are meant to prevent such attacks. It notes that the issue is caused when certificate validation is turned off or not handled properly by app developers. It also highlights the difficulty in determining if a user has been affected by such an attack as there is no obvious cause for login credential compromise.
