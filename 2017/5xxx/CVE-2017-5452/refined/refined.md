Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox for Android handles the visibility of the address bar when a page is loading during a scroll event and interaction with editable HTML elements. Specifically, if a user scrolls down a page, causing the address bar to disappear, and during this scroll event, a new page is loaded (especially if it takes some time to load), the address bar may not reappear immediately.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Location Bar Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is a location bar spoofing issue. The browser fails to consistently display the real address bar when a new page is loading while the user has scrolled down an existing page. This allows a malicious page to maintain the appearance of the previous page and thus display a fake URL in place of the real one.
*   **Dynamic Toolbar Behavior:** The issue is related to the behavior of the dynamic toolbar in Firefox for Android v2, which is supposed to hide the address bar during scrolling. However, this feature interacts poorly with page loading events and user interactions with editable elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Deceptive UI:** An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that, when loaded in a vulnerable browser, will display a fake address bar. This can lead users to believe they are visiting a legitimate website, potentially tricking them into entering credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Credential Theft:** By displaying a fake address bar that suggests a trusted domain while actually loading a malicious site, attackers can steal user credentials or other personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that includes a mechanism that triggers a new website to load while the user scrolls down, causing the location bar to disappear, and the new page loads with a fake address bar. This vulnerability can be further exploited with a fake numeric keypad or web virtual keyboard to trick the user into entering their credentials on the malicious site, which is disguised as the legitimate site.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must scroll down a webpage that contains an editable HTML element (e.g. input, textarea), load a new webpage during the scroll event, and have the real address bar disappear.
* **Timing:** The vulnerability relies on a specific timing window: when a user is scrolling down a webpage and a new page is loading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Webpage:** The attacker needs the ability to host a webpage accessible by the victim's Firefox for Android browser.
*   **Crafting Malicious HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that triggers the described behavior (page loading during scroll, usage of editable elements), causing the address bar to not display correctly when the new page loads.

**Additional Information:**

* The bug report mentions that the patch for a previous bug, [Bug 1293463](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1293463), did not fully address the location bar spoofing issue. This bug builds on that by showing an alternative way to trigger location spoofing.
*   The fix involves keeping the dynamic toolbar visible while the new page is loading.
*   The vulnerability was initially assessed as `sec-high` but later downgraded to `sec-low`.
*   This vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android.

In summary, CVE-2017-5452 is a low-severity location bar spoofing vulnerability that can be exploited by a malicious website by taking advantage of a timing window when a page is loading during scrolling to display a fake URL on Firefox for Android.
