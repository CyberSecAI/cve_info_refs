The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Upstream Skia security bug (<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=6294>) details a variant of [bug 1330166](/show_bug.cgi?id=1330166 "RESOLVED FIXED - skia: heap-buffer-overflow read [@SkA8_Shader_Blitter::blitH]") that was not handled by that fix. All relevant security details of this bug should basically be the same as in [bug 133016](/show_bug.cgi?id=133016 "VERIFIED FIXED - [mozTXTToHTMLConv] Freetext url recognition stops at \")\" and \"'\" (apostrophe)"), just that this is a new way to trigger it. I've fixed up that case now with this patch that ensures the rounding is properly biased for all sides of the bounds rect.
This patch was submitted upstream here: <https://skia-review.googlesource.com/c/9700/>

[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This extends a clipping region to ensure it properly bounds drawing inside it, which solves the crash/sec issue, but does not otherwise change drawing appearance-wise. Applied a similar fix in [bug 1330166](/show_bug.cgi?id=1330166 "RESOLVED FIXED - skia: heap-buffer-overflow read [@SkA8_Shader_Blitter::blitH]") that has as yet caused no problems. This just extends that fix to more cases. Change has also been reviewed/upstreamed to Skia as well.
[String changes made/needed]: None

I noticed that the patch for [Bug 1293463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293463 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox for Android: Location Bar Spoofing Risk - The Location Bar remains hidden when the user manually scrolls down a webpage and another website is loaded during this scroll event") does not prevent all Location Bar Spoofing risks because this patch consists to show the real location bar only when the user clicks on a HTML editable tag (<input type=text> ; <input type=password> ; <textarea>).
The essential problem of patch for [Bug 1293463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293463 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox for Android: Location Bar Spoofing Risk - The Location Bar remains hidden when the user manually scrolls down a webpage and another website is loaded during this scroll event") is that the fake location bar continues to replace the real location bar.
Multiple websites, especially the bank websites allowing access to users' bank accounts using a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard to write its user credentials (customer-ID and Password).
So, a click on an input tag isn't used by these bank websites (leading to the fake location bar continue to be displayed and the real location bar remains hidden during the writing of user credentials by a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard).
NOTE: it's also possible to use fake Android Keyboard to write user credentials needed into a fake <input> tag.
Steps:
Step 1: Go to <http://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/~h5fh85f9j03ftrK9-Location%20Bar%20Spoofing%20with%20scroll%20event%20and%20another%20webpage%20with%20a%20long%20time%20for%20loading~/index-start-1.html> and click on the link (a Google search webpage will be opened into a new tab)
Step 2: Scroll down into this webpage (the location bar disappears) , during this scroll event a malicious webpage will load slowly without that the real Location Bar appears leading to Location Bar Spoofing risks (The real Location Bar remains hidden and a fake location bar will replace this real Location Bar).
<!>Step2 INFO : The loading time of the malicious webpage is 9 seconds when you go on the Google search webpage but this loading time can be changed by a bigger loading time. (The PHP code of "redirect-and-sleep().php" can be changed by a bigger or smaller loading time).<!>
Info about the malicious webpage: The malicious webpage, a numeric keypad should be used to write the Customer ID and the Password (like it is used on the login webpage in a bank website.
Actual results:
The fake location bar continue to be displayed and the real location bar remains hidden during the writing of user credentials by a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard.
The Location Bar remains hidden when the malicious webpage is loaded and this malicious webpage contains a fake Location Bar leading to a Location Bar URL / SSL Spoofing Risk.
Expected results:
The Location Bar should reappear when another webpage is loaded.
When the user scroll down into a first webpage and a 2nd webpage/website is loaded during this scroll event, the real location bar should reappear when the 2nd webpage is completely loaded.
Solution: The Location Bar should be always visible when another webpage is completely loaded.

Sorry, I guess I blew it. I guess some one else did all that on the first one I fixed since I was unaware of the proper procedures.Flags: needinfo?(rbarker)

I don't think this is sec-high. The previous bug that this is effectively a clone of was sec-low. This is also a spoof, and it's easily discovered (just scroll) so I just don't think it warrants sec-high. I've also never seen this "custom keypad" thing before in my life, so I would expect users to be suspicious. Pinging Al to confirm and/or get this sec-triaged.
If we do think this is sec-high or sec-crit, then Randall, you'd want to go to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8844122&action=edit>, set the sec-approval flag to '?' and then fill out the form text indicating what the risks are and where this needs uplift.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

(tbh, you probably want to request approval for beta/aurora anyway, once you're confident this doesn't introduce new regressions. Depending on the security severity, you might also want to ask for esr52 uplift.)

Okay, I asked :snorp and he told me to put it at sec-high. I'm mostly just fumbling around trying to figure out the correct procedure since I've never really had to deal with a security bug before. I'm testing patches for aurora and beta right now. Compiling takes time.

FWIW, we don't ship Android releases off ESR52, so I don't think we need to worry about that.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Dynamic Toolbar v2
[User impact if declined]: The spoofing and described in the bug report would be possible.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:no
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:none
[Is the change risky?]:no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:It is fairly simple patch that just keeps the dynamic toolbar pinned while the page is loading
[String changes made/needed]:none
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not sure, based on the description in the report it isn't too difficult.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? Not that I know of.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? it is in release.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? The dynamic toolbar v2 introduced the bug I believe.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? I was able to cleanly apply the patch to aurora and beta.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? It is always possible when dealing with fennec UI. But the patch is pretty simple.

This looks way more convincing in the video than it is in real life. Relies on abruptly yanking the user to a new site, that yet somehow convinces the user that's what they meant to do. And if you interact with the page and scroll down the real location bar shows up. Lowering the severity, but it's clever and we're awarding a small bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty+Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),
