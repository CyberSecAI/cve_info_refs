Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-5798:

**Vulnerability Overview**
The provided content describes multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in HPE OpenCall Media Platform (OCMP) version 4.3.2. These vulnerabilities exist in three components of the platform: Application Content Manager, Platform Administration Tool, and VoiceXML Administration Tool.

**Root Cause**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the application's response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted link or interact with a compromised page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-provided input without proper sanitization, enabling injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Application Content Manager:** Unsanitized "description" and "prototype" parameters in `/mcm/resources/`
    *   **Platform Administration Tool:** Multiple vulnerable parameters in the `GetMapAction` function (LEV_TYPE0, LEV_TYPE1, LEV_TYPE2, LEV_TYPE3, LEV_NAME0, LEV_NAME1, LEV_NAME2, LEV_NAME3, LEV_NUM, NAME),  `cdrdispatch` function (next and sessionType parameters), leading to potential Remote Code Execution
    *   **VoiceXML Administration Tool:** Unsanitized input in `event.do` and `call.do` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies and take over the victim's account.
*   **Information Theft:** Sensitive information displayed on the page could be exfiltrated.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website or inject code to download malware.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The XSS vulnerability in the Platform Administration Tool can lead to Remote Code Execution when combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can manipulate the page to display phishing login forms.

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript and tricks a victim into clicking it.
*   **Compromised Pages:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a legitimate page viewed by a victim.
*   **POST Requests:** In the Application Content Manager, a POST request is first used to store the malicious javascript, which is then executed using a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or POST requests.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user of the vulnerable application to access the crafted URL or make a request that triggers the injection.

**Additional Notes**
*   The advisory also details a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability (RFI) in the `proxylink.do` function in the VoiceXML Administration Tool, which is related to CVE-2017-5799. This RFI can be used for remote code execution when chained with XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The affected product is HPE OpenCall Media Platform (OCMP) version 4.3.2.
*   Patches were released by HPE to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Paolo Stagno from VoidSec to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.
* The exploit-db entry lists a variety of vulnerable parameters within the Platform Administration Tool's `GetMapAction` function, including `LEV_TYPE0`, `LEV_TYPE1`, `LEV_TYPE2`, `LEV_TYPE3`, `LEV_NAME0`, `LEV_NAME1`, `LEV_NAME2`, `LEV_NAME3`, `LEV_NUM`, and `NAME`.
