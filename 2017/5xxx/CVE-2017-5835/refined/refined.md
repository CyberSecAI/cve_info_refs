Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5835:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is caused by a memory allocation error in libplist when processing crafted Apple Property List files. Specifically, the code attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory due to a large value for `num_objects` which is derived from the plist data. This can occur when parsing binary plist files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Excessive Memory Allocation:** The primary vulnerability is the uncontrolled allocation of a large memory block, triggered by a manipulated input value (`num_objects`). This can lead to a denial-of-service condition if the allocation fails or consumes excessive resources.
-   **Integer Overflow:** Although not the primary vulnerability, the large size of the value may be related to an integer overflow, which could also be considered part of the cause of the memory allocation issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted plist file that triggers the excessive memory allocation. The service may crash due to the failure or exhaustion of system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Plist File:** The primary attack vector is through the use of crafted plist files, typically binary plist files, containing specific data that results in an attempt to allocate a large memory chunk. The file needs to contain a large number of objects as `num_objects` is derived from the plist content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or have the targeted application process a malicious plist file. This could occur in various contexts such as receiving the plist file as input or having it parsed by a vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided information from the mailing lists and github issues provide more details than the original CVE description (PLACEHOLDER), by detailing the memory allocation error.
-   The issue is located in the `plist_from_bin` function within `bplist.c`.
-   The vulnerability can be detected using AddressSanitizer, as shown in the provided crash logs.
-   This is one of multiple vulnerabilities reported in libplist, which were fixed in version 1.11-3+deb8u1.
