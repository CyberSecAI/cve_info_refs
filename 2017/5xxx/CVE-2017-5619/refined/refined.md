{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application allowed login with a hashed password instead of the valid password string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure password handling",
      "Use of plain password hashing algorithm (SHA2 without salt)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the user database (containing password hashes) could log in as any user without knowing their actual password.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct login using a user's password hash from the database"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have access to the Zammad user database."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was mitigated by removing the old plain password functionality, disabling it completely and improving the password encryption to Argon2 from SHA2 (without a salt)."
