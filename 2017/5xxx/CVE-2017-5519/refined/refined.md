The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in GeniXCMS, specifically within the `Posts.class.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The primary cause is the lack of sanitization or proper escaping of user-supplied input (specifically parameters) when used in SQL queries. The functions `getParam()`, `delParam()`, and `existParam()` in `Posts.class.php` do not filter incoming parameters, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Several functions directly embed unsanitized user-supplied data into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate database queries to extract sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control over the server by injecting arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are primarily accessed through HTTP GET parameters, such as `$_GET['id']`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious GET parameters to specific scripts within the GeniXCMS application. This implies they have network access to the application and knowledge of the vulnerable entry points.
- No authentication information is directly specified, but the attacker would likely need to be able to reach pages/scripts with these vulnerabilities.

**Specific examples provided:**
- `pages.control.php` line 165 is vulnerable because it passes the `$_GET['id']` directly to `Posts::existParam` and potentially `Posts::editParam` or `Posts::addParam`.
- `pages_form.php` line 133 passes `$_GET['id']` into `Language::getLangParam`, which in turn calls `Posts::getParam` and is vulnerable.
- `posts_form.php` line 122 also uses `$_GET['id']` with `Posts::existParam`, which is vulnerable.

These issues are due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data, allowing SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple locations.
