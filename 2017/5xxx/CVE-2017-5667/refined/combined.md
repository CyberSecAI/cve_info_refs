# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201702-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the host system.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.0-r1** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with
privileges of QEMU process on the host, gain privileges on the host
system, cause a Denial of Service condition, or obtain sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.8.0-r1"

```

| **Date**: | Mon, 30 Jan 2017 12:17:36 +0530 |

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

While doing multi block SDMA transfer in routine
'sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks', the 's->fifo_buffer' starting
index 'begin' and data length 's->data_count' could end up to be same.
This could lead to an OOB access issue. Correct transfer data length
to avoid it.

Subject: CVE request Qemu: sd: sdhci OOB access during multi block SDMA
 transfer

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the SDHCI device emulation support is
vulnerable to an OOB heap access issue. It could occur while doing a multi
block SDMA transfer via 'sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks' routine.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the
Qemu process on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-01/msg06191.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417559>

This issue was reported by Jiang Xin of Huawei PSIR team.

Thank you.
