User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20170125094131
Steps to reproduce:
I noticed that the patch for [Bug 1293463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293463 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox for Android: Location Bar Spoofing Risk - The Location Bar remains hidden when the user manually scrolls down a webpage and another website is loaded during this scroll event") does not prevent all Location Bar Spoofing risks because this patch consists to show the real location bar only when the user clicks on a HTML editable tag (<input type=text> ; <input type=password> ; <textarea>).
The essential problem of patch for [Bug 1293463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293463 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox for Android: Location Bar Spoofing Risk - The Location Bar remains hidden when the user manually scrolls down a webpage and another website is loaded during this scroll event") is that the fake location bar continues to replace the real location bar.
Multiple websites, especially the bank websites allowing access to users' bank accounts using a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard to write its user credentials (customer-ID and Password).
So, a click on an input tag isn't used by these bank websites (leading to the fake location bar continue to be displayed and the real location bar remains hidden during the writing of user credentials by a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard).
NOTE: it's also possible to use fake Android Keyboard to write user credentials needed into a fake <input> tag.
Steps:
Step 1: Go to <http://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/~h5fh85f9j03ftrK9-Location%20Bar%20Spoofing%20with%20scroll%20event%20and%20another%20webpage%20with%20a%20long%20time%20for%20loading~/index-start-1.html> and click on the link (a Google search webpage will be opened into a new tab)
Step 2: Scroll down into this webpage (the location bar disappears) , during this scroll event a malicious webpage will load slowly without that the real Location Bar appears leading to Location Bar Spoofing risks (The real Location Bar remains hidden and a fake location bar will replace this real Location Bar).
<!>Step2 INFO : The loading time of the malicious webpage is 9 seconds when you go on the Google search webpage but this loading time can be changed by a bigger loading time. (The PHP code of "redirect-and-sleep().php" can be changed by a bigger or smaller loading time).<!>
Info about the malicious webpage: The malicious webpage, a numeric keypad should be used to write the Customer ID and the Password (like it is used on the login webpage in a bank website.
Actual results:
The fake location bar continue to be displayed and the real location bar remains hidden during the writing of user credentials by a numeric keypad or a web virtual keyboard.
The Location Bar remains hidden when the malicious webpage is loaded and this malicious webpage contains a fake Location Bar leading to a Location Bar URL / SSL Spoofing Risk.
Expected results:
The Location Bar should reappear when another webpage is loaded.
When the user scroll down into a first webpage and a 2nd webpage/website is loaded during this scroll event, the real location bar should reappear when the 2nd webpage is completely loaded.
Solution: The Location Bar should be always visible when another webpage is completely loaded.

Patch looks fine to me, I didn't check to see if it closes all the gaps that result in the spoofing risk.

Sorry, I guess I blew it. I guess some one else did all that on the first one I fixed since I was unaware of the proper procedures.Flags: needinfo?(rbarker)

I don't think this is sec-high. The previous bug that this is effectively a clone of was sec-low. This is also a spoof, and it's easily discovered (just scroll) so I just don't think it warrants sec-high. I've also never seen this "custom keypad" thing before in my life, so I would expect users to be suspicious. Pinging Al to confirm and/or get this sec-triaged.
If we do think this is sec-high or sec-crit, then Randall, you'd want to go to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8844122&action=edit>, set the sec-approval flag to '?' and then fill out the form text indicating what the risks are and where this needs uplift.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

(tbh, you probably want to request approval for beta/aurora anyway, once you're confident this doesn't introduce new regressions. Depending on the security severity, you might also want to ask for esr52 uplift.)

Okay, I asked :snorp and he told me to put it at sec-high. I'm mostly just fumbling around trying to figure out the correct procedure since I've never really had to deal with a security bug before. I'm testing patches for aurora and beta right now. Compiling takes time.

FWIW, we don't ship Android releases off ESR52, so I don't think we need to worry about that.

0001-Bug-1344517-Keep-dynamic-toolbar-visible-while-page-is-loading-r-kats-17030611-d9cf452bebd9.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Dynamic Toolbar v2
[User impact if declined]: The spoofing and described in the bug report would be possible.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:no
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:none
[Is the change risky?]:no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:It is fairly simple patch that just keeps the dynamic toolbar pinned while the page is loading
[String changes made/needed]:none
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not sure, based on the description in the report it isn't too difficult.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? Not that I know of.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? it is in release.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? The dynamic toolbar v2 introduced the bug I believe.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? I was able to cleanly apply the patch to aurora and beta.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? It is always possible when dealing with fennec UI. But the patch is pretty simple.

This looks way more convincing in the video than it is in real life. Relies on abruptly yanking the user to a new site, that yet somehow convinces the user that's what they meant to do. And if you interact with the page and scroll down the real location bar shows up. Lowering the severity, but it's clever and we're awarding a small bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty+Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Not quite cross-site scripting (did we disable script in the feed context?), but HTML injection through the feed's <title> element.
This example uses a feed that was found to echo its params, but a site could also make its own feed to do this. Mitigation: since script doesn't run it's really down to the imagination of the attacker whether they could get a user to interact with the injected elements and what that might fool the user into doing.
Interestingly, the feed in the example is escaping the attempt to inject angle brackets; loaded as raw XML the feed is safe. The feed reader code is taking &lt;&gt; and turning them back into live angle brackets! Why?!
Maybe I'm lacking imagination but for now calling this a sec-low spoof.Group: firefox-core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Whatever the feed preview page chooses to do with it, the feed parser is doing the right thing: <title type="html">&lt;br></title> says to tell the consuming app "here's some HTML source, '<br>', do with it as you will". The &lt; is at the XML layer, you have to escape < in XML content, so an XML parser just says "you've got an element named title, with the type attribute 'html' and the content <br>."

None of this is being used. The feedwriter code (which constructs the dynamic portion of the contents of subscribe.xhtml) calls createDocumentFragment - not the DOM one, but a custom one defined here: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b548da4e16f067e5b69349376e37b2db97983cf7/toolkit/components/feeds/FeedProcessor.js#612-630> which uses parserUtils to parse the contents as HTML.
This very much looks like it's a deliberate decision in order to preserve markup in feeds, so just using the text will almost certainly break real-world sites (inasmuch as RSS is still a thing).
We can drop forms by using better sanitize flags. I'm kind of surprised that dropping forms isn't the nsIParserUtils default (ie allowing style/script is opt-in, but apparently allowing forms is opt-out - it's not clear to me \*why\*...).

So, just to explain: I decided rendering html in the title and subtitle of the feed, as well as the title of entries in the feed, was pointless, so I disabled it. The only place we continue to show HTML is in the feed entry content, where we now strip form elements and a number of other things.

So apparently people put in actual work to make HTML work in the titles here, see [bug 436801](/show_bug.cgi?id=436801 "RESOLVED FIXED - XHTML not properly supported in Feed titles"). I don't really mind what we do - we can update the test, or we can make the code allow markup and strip forms and some other stuff (changes which the patch already includes) and hope nobody finds yet another way of abusing the limited set of HTML allowed.

Cool, so this is intentional and goes through the sanitizer -- that's good to hear and we can unhide this.
Forms are spoofy and hard to imagine are used or wanted in feeds; definitely not in titles. I'd still like to sanitize forms away but we can live with the rest. You don't want to use SanitizerCidEmbedsOnly -- that's for email and will result in no images in the feed, and people clearly want those. I don't think we need to use SanitizerDropNonCSSPresentation either.Group: firefox-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---) → [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)See Also: → [436801](/show_bug.cgi?id=436801 "RESOLVED FIXED - XHTML not properly supported in Feed titles")

Also take note that you can generate video elements which can go full screen with no user interaction required(or warnings about).
This could be used to recreate the browser in its entirety and possibly do some very nice phishing and other nastiness.

Er, how (without script)?

How? You can't overlay on the fullscreen <video> element so there's no way to get user input, and you can't run script (in the RSS feed reader, anyway).
But a fullscreen video element can be accomplished without the rss reader, and at that point none of the rest of the RSS reader is visible anymore, so I don't see the point of channeling this through the RSS reader.
The point here is that in theory you could use the context of the RSS reader in order for the user to give you more trust in a form displayed in it or whatever. So the <video> stuff seems completely orthogonal, because you are no longer abusing the trust that's part of the RSS reader's content.

I agree with Gijs, it is not possible to execute javascript code in rss reader.
In my opinion, the insertion of the form inside a gold colored box offers some credibility being able to persuade the user to enter their credentials but there are no other html elements likely to be misleading in the context of the RSS reader.

To correct myself, once in full screen video mode there is no warnings or confirmation that it is fullscreen. I would assume clickjacking could be used to get the video full screen, but yes it is not automatic, just worrisome. Apparently about: pages are trusted with media to some degree.
