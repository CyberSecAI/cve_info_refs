#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] xhci: apply limits to loops |
| **Date**: | Mon, 6 Feb 2017 13:21:09 +0100 |

```
Limits should be big enough that normal guest should not hit it.
Add a tracepoint to log them, just in case.  Also, while being
at it, log the existing link trb limit too.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

(to answer [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c4)) >  > mzamazal already answered me on irc - it wasn't postcopy  To be precise, I only said that it was quite unlikely being postcopy. Dan, we can be sure if you tell us what oVirt/RHV version do you use (oVirt <= 4.0.* doesn't have postcopy), or provide us with vdsm.log (or simply grep it for "post-copy") in case you use 4.1.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c15)  Dan Kenigsberg    2017-02-15 08:46:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Milan Zamazal from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c14))  Milan, [bug 1421589](show_bug.cgi?id=1421589 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - there is no limit to storage wasted by multiple core dumps on migration destination") which I referred you to should have all the logs, saying that it was rhev-4.1-beta, with a 4.0 source host and a 4.1 destination host. Unless we have a horrible bug, Engine should never request postcopy in this condition; I asked you to verify that.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c16)  Milan Zamazal    2017-02-15 09:18:18 UTC  ``` I see, I can't see the logs there but you are right, it can't be post-copy. Even if Engine requested postcopy, it wouldn't be actually triggered since there is no support for it on the 4.0 source host.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c23)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-01 13:30:30 UTC  ``` I can't reproduce this bug - even though I know I've hit it myself and this is a separate case of it. We've tried using the same image template as the one that crashed. I've also tried with my own f24 image. Both in lots of different states of what was running.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c24)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-01 18:23:09 UTC  ``` Hi Gerd,   I've been digging about a bit in the qxl code; can you explain to me why qxl_track_command only sets qxl->guest_cursor on a QXL_CURSOR_SET?    My concern is if a QXL_CURSOR_HIDE happens (after a SET), does that leave qxl->guest_cursor pointing at potentially garbage that could trigger this bug?  I can see that the guest_cursor is non-NULL during a migrate after a QXL_CURSOR_HIDE.  (Not that I can trigger the failure)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c25)  Gerd Hoffmann    2017-03-06 08:31:39 UTC  ``` >   My concern is if a QXL_CURSOR_HIDE happens (after a SET), does that leave > qxl->guest_cursor pointing at potentially garbage that could trigger this > bug?  Very plausible.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c26)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-06 11:46:46 UTC  ``` Thanks and I see the patch you posted; looking we also have:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1290039](show_bug.cgi?id=1290039 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - [abrt] qemu-system-x86: spice_logv(): qemu-system-x86_64 killed by SIGABRT") and [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1210536](show_bug.cgi?id=1210536 "CLOSED EOL - [abrt] qemu-system-x86: validate_virt(): qemu-system-x86_64 killed by SIGABRT") which look like similar backtraces  they refer to FAF <https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/reports/430337/> although curiously that has no f24 or f25 hits, which makes you wonder if there's another thing that fixed it somehow.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c27)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-06 11:52:05 UTC  ``` ah, no, here are the f25 versions: <https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/problems/bthash/?bth=3f4b726cc33210a2d48eb4597096a3527fe234ed&bth=bb9782ecb205ad23175b009565273c66a0661a96>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1421788#c28)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-09 19:36:28 UTC  ``` Gerd's patch is now:  dbb5fb8d3519130559b10fa4e1395e4486c633f8 in upstream qemu  Since we have no way of testing this I'm going to mark this as fixed in 2.9 and we'll pick it up in a release.  We could ask for a backport  - my suspicion is that other customers are hitting it.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.9.0). (BZ#1387372, BZ#1387600, BZ#1400962)

Security Fix(es):

* A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Network Block Device (NBD) client support. The flaw could occur while processing server's response to a 'NBD\_OPT\_LIST' request. A malicious NBD server could use this issue to crash a remote NBD client resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on client host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-2630)
* An integer overflow flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in the CCID Card device support. The flaw could occur while passing messages via command/response packets to and from the host. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-5898)
* An information exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, affecting other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs(CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2016-4020, CVE-2016-6835, CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-7466, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2017-2630, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5898, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375) were fixed as result of rebase to QEMU version 2.9.0.

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201704-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could the worst of which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.0-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.0-r9** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote server can cause a crash in the client causing execution of
arbitrary code, and a Denial of Service within the QEMU process. Remote
or Local users within a guest QEMU environment can cause a Denial of
Service condition of the QEMU guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.8.0-r9"

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton), and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with Network Block Device (NBD) Server support was vulnerable to a null-pointer dereference issue. The flaw could occur when releasing a client that was not initialized due to failed negotiation. A remote user or process could exploit this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server (denial of service). (CVE-2017-9524)
* An information-exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, which affected other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs were fixed as a result of rebase to QEMU 2.9.0. (CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-6414, CVE-2017-8309, CVE-2017-8379, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Source host(rhel7.2.z): kernel-3.10.0-327.50.1.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.3.0-31.el7_2.25.x86_64  Destination host(rhel7.4): kernel-3.10.0-558.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.8.0-3.el7.x86_64  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1.boot rhel7.2 or win2012r2 guest in source host: # /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm \ -name rhel7 \ -machine pc-i440fx-rhel7.2.0,accel=kvm,usb=off \ -m 2048 \ -cpu Opteron_G4,check \ -realtime mlock=off \ -smp 4,maxcpus=4,sockets=4,cores=1,threads=1 \ -uuid 49a3438a-70a3-4ba8-92ce-3a05e0934608 \ -nodefaults \ -rtc base=utc,driftfix=slew \ -boot order=c,menu=on,strict=on \ -drive file=/mnt/rhel7.2.qcow2,if=none,id=drive-data-disk,format=qcow2,serial=f65effa5-90a6-47f2-8487-a9f64c95d4f5,cache=none,discard=unmap,werror=stop,rerror=stop,aio=threads \ -device ide-hd,drive=drive-data-disk,id=system-disk,logical_block_size=512,physical_block_size=512,min_io_size=32,opt_io_size=64,discard_granularity=512,ver=fuxc-ver,bus=ide.0,unit=0 \ -net none \ -monitor stdio \ -qmp tcp:0:4466,server,nowait -serial unix:/tmp/ttym,server,nowait \ -spice port=5910,addr=0.0.0.0,disable-ticketing,seamless-migration=on \ -device qxl-vga,id=video0,ram_size=134217728,vram_size=67108864,vgamem_mb=16,bus=pci.0,addr=0x2 \  2. boot the guest in destination host with "-incoming tcp:0:5800"  3. do migration (qemu)migration -d tcp:10.73.72.56:5800  Actual results: after step3, when migration is finished, guest reboot in destination.  Expected results: guest does not reboot.  Additional info: I also use the same comand line to test migration from RHEL7.3.z->RHEL7.4, not hit this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c2)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-02-16 10:36:55 UTC  ``` Confirmed.

I think it ends up in SMM - for reasons I don't understand - then runs through an area of junk before finally hitting an undefined instruction and triple faulting. I've not tracked down what that initial 'external interrupt' is - it doesn't seem to match the vector of any registered device on the guest.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c5)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-02-17 12:10:00 UTC  ``` Still looking like SMM/SMI. 7.2 ends up setting CPU_INTERRUPT_SMI - but ignores it. When we read the migration stream we end up with that set and causing the SMI entry. What I've not figured out yet is why 7.3 doesn't do the entry - it has the SMI entry code.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c6)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-02-17 12:48:51 UTC  ``` OK, the reason 7.3 worked is it had a bug with SMIs didn't get delivered; that was fixed in 7.4 by: 68c6efe07a4729b54947658df4fceed84f3d0fef   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c7)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-02-17 17:14:14 UTC  ``` Posted downstream:   x86: Work around SMI breakages  Please try this with lots of machine types and also with EFI firmware on q35.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c8)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-02-23 13:38:49 UTC  ``` Taken a different tack, and posted upstream, we'll need to wait for it to swing back around.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c9)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2017-03-06 10:32:46 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 2.9, commit fc3a1fd74fac0e3233060aaaf923fe8ec104b48f   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c15)  huiqingding    2017-05-04 08:52:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dr. David Alan Gilbert from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1420679#c7)) > Posted downstream: >   x86: Work around SMI breakages >  > Please try this with lots of machine types and also with EFI firmware on q35.  Verify this bug using: rhel7.2.z host: kernel-3.10.0-327.53.1.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.3.0-31.el7_2.25.x86_64 rhel7.4 host: kernel-3.10.0-663.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.9.0-2.el7.x86_64  Test migration rhel7.2.z<->rhel7.4 with machine types "-M rhel7.2.0/rhel7.1.0/rhel7.0.0/rhel6.6.0/rhel6.5.0", test two guests: rhel7.2.z and win2012r2. The result is pass, migration can be finished normally and guest does not reboot after migration.    For qemu-kvm-rhev-2.9.0-2.el7.x86_64, only supports pc-q35-rhel7.4.0 and pc-q35-rhel7.3.0.

# QEMU and the Spectre and Meltdown attacks

04 Jan 2018 (Updated 05 Jan 2018) — by Paolo Bonzini and Eduardo Habkost

As you probably know by now, three critical architectural flaws in CPUs have
been recently disclosed that allow user processes to read kernel or hypervisor
memory through cache side-channel attacks. These flaws, collectively
named *Meltdown* and *Spectre*, affect in one way or another almost
all processors that perform out-of-order execution, including x86 (from
Intel and AMD), POWER, s390 and ARM processors.

No microcode updates are required to block the *Meltdown* attack. In
addition, the *Meltdown* flaw does not allow a malicious guest to read the
contents of hypervisor memory. Fixing it only requires that the operating
system separates the user and kernel address spaces (known as *page table
isolation* for the Linux kernel), which can be done separately on the host
and the guests. Therefore, this post will focus on *Spectre*, and especially
on [CVE-2017-5715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715).

Fixing or mitigating *Spectre* in general, and CVE-2017-5715 in particular,
requires cooperation between the processor and the operating system kernel or
hypervisor; the processor can be updated through microcode or millicode
patches to provide the required functionality.

Among the three vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5715 is notable because
it allows guests to read potentially sensitive data from hypervisor
memory. Patching the host kernel is sufficient to block attacks from
guests to the host. On the other hand, in order to protect the guest
kernel from a malicious userspace, updates are also needed to the guest
kernel and, depending on the processor architecture, to QEMU.

Just like on bare-metal, the guest kernel will use the new functionality
provided by the microcode or millicode updates. When running under a
hypervisor, processor emulation is mostly out of QEMU’s scope, so QEMU’s
role in the fix is small, but nevertheless important. In the case of KVM:

* QEMU configures the hypervisor to emulate a specific processor model.
  For x86, QEMU has to be aware of new CPUID bits introduced by the microcode
  update, and it must provide them to guests depending on how the guest is
  configured.
* upon virtual machine migration, QEMU reads the CPU state on the source
  and transmits it to the destination. For x86, QEMU has to be aware of new
  model specific registers (MSRs).

Right now, there are no public patches to KVM that expose the new CPUID bits
and MSRs to the virtual machines, therefore there is no urgent need to update
QEMU; remember that **updating the host kernel is enough to protect the
host from malicious guests**. Nevertheless, updates will be posted to the
qemu-devel mailing list in the next few days, and a 2.11.1 patch release
will be released with the fix.

Once updates are provided, **live migration to an updated version of
QEMU will not be enough to protect guest kernel from guest userspace**.
Because the virtual CPU has to be changed to one with the new CPUID bits,
the guest will have to be restarted.

As of today, the QEMU project is not aware of whether similar changes will
be required for non-x86 processors. If so, they will also be posted to the
mailing list and backported to recent stable releases.

For more information on the vulnerabilities, please refer to the [Google Security
Blog](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html)
and [Google Project
Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.it/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)
posts on the topic, as well as the [Spectre and Meltdown FAQ](https://meltdownattack.com/#faq).

**5 Jan 2018**: clarified the level of protection provided by the host kernel
update; added a note on live migration; clarified the impact of Meltdown on
virtualization hosts
