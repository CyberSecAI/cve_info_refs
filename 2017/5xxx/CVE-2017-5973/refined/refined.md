{
  "CVE-2017-5973": {
    "description": "Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the USB xHCI controller emulator support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing control transfer descriptor's sequence in xhci_kick_epctx.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper loop limits within the `xhci_kick_epctx` function when processing control transfer descriptors. The code did not prevent an infinite loop if a specific sequence of descriptors were received.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the Qemu process, resulting in denial of service on the host.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted USB control transfer sequence.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to interact with the emulated USB xHCI controller, typically achievable from a privileged user within the guest operating system."
