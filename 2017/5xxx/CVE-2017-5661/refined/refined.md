  "CVE-2017-5661": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An XML external entities (XXE) vulnerability exists in Apache FOP.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "XXE vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary users can reveal files on the filesystem of the server running FOP by sending maliciously crafted SVG files. The severity depends on the user context; if FOP is running as root, a full compromise of the server is possible, including disclosure of sensitive files. XXE can also be used to trigger denial-of-service attacks by amplifying requests.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending maliciously formed SVG files to an application using Apache FOP.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send malicious SVG files to an application using Apache FOP. User privileges on the server is a factor on the severity of impact."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Tenable.sc versions 5.18.0 and earlier",
