- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `yr_compiler_destroy()` function of the YARA library. The vulnerability occurs because memory allocated for the compiler arena is freed, but a pointer to that memory is subsequently accessed in `yr_compiler_destroy`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free. The code attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to a crash (as demonstrated by the ASan output). The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted YARA rule that triggers the vulnerable code path during compilation. Specifically, compiling the provided `yara_uaf_yr_compiler_destroy.yar` file with the `yara` command-line tool (`yara yara_uaf_yr_compiler_destroy.yar strings`) triggers the vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious YARA rules that trigger the vulnerability.
