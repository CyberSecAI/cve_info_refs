{
  "CVE-2017-5433": {
    "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability in SMIL animation functions occurs when pointers to animation elements in an array are dropped from the animation controller while still in use.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering the vulnerability requires specific SMIL animation interactions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to craft a specific SMIL animation scenario that triggers dropping pointers to animation elements while they are still in use by the animation controller."
