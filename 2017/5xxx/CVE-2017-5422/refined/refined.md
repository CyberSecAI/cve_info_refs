Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the browser's handling of nested `view-source:` URLs. When a hyperlink contains multiple nested `view-source:` protocols, the browser's recursive keyword fixup process leads to a stack exhaustion, causing the browser to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is a stack exhaustion caused by a recursive function call when processing nested `view-source:` URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a browser crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The user is forced to close and restart the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can create a malicious web page containing a hyperlink with deeply nested `view-source:` URLs. When a user clicks on this link, it triggers the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Serve a Web Page:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that a victim can access.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click the malicious hyperlink to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by preventing the browser from accepting nested `view-source:` references in the `nsDefaultURIFixup` function.
- The vulnerability is classified as "sec-low", indicating a low security risk, likely because the impact is limited to a crash (DoS) and does not involve remote code execution or information disclosure.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 52.
- The bug report mentions that viewing the source of `view-source:` is pointless and should be blocked.

In summary, CVE-2017-5422 is a denial-of-service vulnerability that occurs due to a stack exhaustion when handling nested `view-source:` URLs in Firefox.
