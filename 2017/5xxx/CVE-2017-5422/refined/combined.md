Steps to reproduce:
This requires popups to be allowed. If we open a url within onbeforeprint event, we can trick a victim into thinking theyre in a trusted website.
Open attached PoC and follow instructions.
Actual results:
We are able to hijack the print preview window with any HTML and javascript we like.
Expected results:
New content should have been blocked, as usually print preview has no javascript in it. But having these active contents might be a problem.

Olli, seeing as you recently looked at this stuff in [bug 1214805](/show_bug.cgi?id=1214805 "REOPENED - Navigation not working while printing (onafterprint)"), I'm guessing you might be the best person to look at what's going on here?

But the navigation doesn't happen on the window where beforeprint is dispatched.
And if any background tab opens a new window, it leads to this weird case.
FF UI shouldn't let other tabs to become the foreground tabs while showing pp.Component: Document Navigation → Print Preview

This is a bit scary how the comment describes this as being so racy. And what happens if entering print preview fails, does that mean tabbrowser is effectively broken as it won't allow any tab changes until Firefox is restarted?

Is this right?
let a = b = 5;
Should `a` == 5 if we are unable to set `b` to 5? Or should `a` be set to the original value of `b`, thus `undefined` in this case.
Testing this in the JS Console, I did:
var d;
var c = d = (function() { throw 1; })();
and afterwards c == undefined as well as d == undefined.
Therefore, if we are unable to set `this.mTabBox.selectedTab` to val, then we should return `this.mTabBox.selectedTab` instead of val.

Well, the current thing isn't racy, adding it in onEnter (which was the first thing I tried) would be racy.

AIUI onExit will always be called if this code runs, so I don't think that can happen. Mike would probably know for sure?
And I agree that's scary, but equally I don't see how else we're going to do this. We do want to actually block the navigations while in PP.

TBH, I expect more code to fail if we do that than what the patch does. If code does:
let myTab = gBrowser.selectedTab = gBrowser.addTab(...);
do we really want myTab to now be the wrong reference?
(this pattern is pretty common in tests, see <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=%3D%20gBrowser.selectedTab%20%3D> , which makes me think add-ons might use it, too)Flags: needinfo?(jaws)

Right, which is why I thought it important to call out. I would prefer that we follow the standard way that assignment is implemented here. It's much easier to reason about than if we were to use some other behavior that isn't the norm.
I would like to think a little more about the onExit part first. I'll leave needinfo flag on the bug so I don't forget.

I looked a little bit more in to this. I would like it if we could wrap the enter/exit with a try/finally and clear `tabSwitchingEnabled` in the finally, but we don't have a simple code path here. The code is mainly event based and looks to have entrances from multiple paths.
Mike, what do you think?Flags: needinfo?(jaws) → needinfo?(mconley)

One other thing we could do, which I didn't realize until long after I wrote this patch, is somehow try to force the print preview browser to stay on top. AIUI we create a separate browser for the print preview. It's not clear to me why that browser gets moved out of view for the newly-focused tab. If the new browser was "always on top" as it were, we wouldn't have to mess with tab switching in the browser (though of course the user could then still end up on a different tab than where they started from, when closing print preview).

I dunno - fixing this in the front-end feels like an end-of-pipe solution. Why would we even support calling window.open from within onbeforeprint? Can we check to see if we're in one of these event handlers and NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE our way out of window.open in that case instead?Flags: needinfo?(mconley) → needinfo?(bugs)

As Olli pointed out in [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1301876#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Print preview hijacking leads to potential spoof"), the same thing would happen if you had other background windows that did this. That's already confusing for users if it happens "by accident". If a malicious actor wanted to abuse this problem, they could easily do so via named windows and call window.open from somewhere else. The navigation doesn't happen in the window that's in print preview (and/or the one that fires beforeprint).

This is definitely a front-end issue. The issue isn't, in general, the page which gets before/afterprint but all the tabs user has open.Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

Patch v0.1

So it turns out the print preview browser is just another tabbed browser, so this isn't really any different from the existing patch.
Effectively, I think [comment #9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1301876#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Print preview hijacking leads to potential spoof") devolves to r?mconley, so I'm going to set that.
One thing that may or may not make this more palatable from a "don't mess up the tabbrowser" perspective, but potentially more jarring for the user, is if we only disable the tabswitching in Enter(), but then also re-force the print preview tab to become the selected tab (and remove the tabswitch-disabling in Exit() as is done now).

I, like jaws, am worried about unforeseen conditions that might result in our user being unable to switch tabs in this window - for example, something going awfully wrong in the teardown of print preview.
Ideally, that'd be as impossible a condition as possible. Could we perhaps have some kind of safeguard, where if the user mouseenters the tabbrowser-tabs (which is normally hidden in print preview), we ensure that tabSwitchingEnabled is true? How do you feel about that - overkill? I'm just antsy about unknown unknowns here, since we're effectively adding a switch to a critical function of the browser.

Not necessarily, but in this particular case, I think the screenshot is pretty suggestive of how you'd exploit.
In any case, this bug is going to need a sec-rating and I need to update the patch, which I hope to do later today.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Attached patch

[Patch v0.2](attachment.cgi?id=8795764&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8795764&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1301876&attachment=8795764)

I think this also works, and will be automatically unbroken when the navtoolbox is no longer collapsed, which seems like it would be enough to avoid permanently bricking stuff. There's a little flicker in the testcase for me, but that seems pretty OK given that this won't actually happen in "normal" usecases (only if the webpage tries to spoof you like the PoC).
I can look at doing a testcase for this but without a sec-rating I don't know if it'll even land when we fix this, so I'll leave that for now.

Calling this spoof sec-low (as are most spoofs).
\* only affects the tiny minority who disable the pop-up blocker
\* you have to convince a user to print preview your page (not a common action)
\* You're printing a page from foo.com and suddenly it turns into mybank.com?
that's suspicious, why would the user believe that?
\* it's a print preview, not an interactive page. What can you get out of it?Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Huh, when filing a bug for having an automated test, noticed [bug 148892](/show_bug.cgi?id=148892 "NEW - Clicking on link in mail loaded page in print preview") and [bug 244705](/show_bug.cgi?id=244705 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Link to browser window in Print Preview mode results in \"The document cannot change while Printing or in Print Preview.\" error") and [bug 601248](/show_bug.cgi?id=601248 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - If I click another tab while Print Preview loads, that other tab is shown in the print-preview pane"). Once this hits Nightly I'll see if those bugs can be resolved. AIUI we can open up sec-low spoofing bugs so I might just dupe the open ones here and make this public.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

[Bug 1295002 - don't accept nested view-source: references in nsDefaultURIFixup,](attachment.cgi?id=8796980)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8796980&action=edit)

This seems like much the simplest way to prevent the recursion. Other alternatives
include some kind of member var to track state (which wouldn't be threadsafe, though
I don't know that that really matters for this component) or adding a field on
nsIDefaultURIFixupInfo, which seems ugly. This is a bit hacky, but it seems to work.

I guess we can do this. Stipping view-source in a loop might be a bit nicer, but shouldn't really matter.

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
