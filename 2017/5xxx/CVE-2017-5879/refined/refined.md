Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection present in Exponent CMS version 2.4.1 and possibly other versions.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to insufficient sanitization of the `src` parameter in the `source_selector.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't get direct feedback from the database. They infer information based on the server's response time or other side-effects of the injected query.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `src` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database using out-of-band techniques like `select_loadfile()`.
- **Potentially Full System Compromise:** Although not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection vulnerabilities can, in some cases, lead to full system compromise if the underlying database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a simple HTTP GET request.
- **`src` parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `src` in the `source_selector.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning no prior login or user privileges are necessary.
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based SQL injection. The attacker injects a SQL query that includes `sleep(2)`. If the server delays its response by 2 seconds, this indicates successful SQL injection.
  ```
  GET /source_selector.php?controller=blog&action=showall&src=@random4d4c8bfba590f\'%2b(select*from(select(sleep(2)))a)%2b\' HTTP/1.1
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a "Critical" severity score of 9.8/10 according to CVSS v3.
- The EPSS score is 0.146%, indicating a relatively low but non-zero probability of exploitation.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
- The issue was reported on February 6, 2017, and published to the GitHub Advisory Database on May 17, 2022.
