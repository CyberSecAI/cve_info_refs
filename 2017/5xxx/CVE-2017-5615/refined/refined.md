Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how cgiemail and cgiecho handle redirects, specifically related to the "success" and "failure" parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTTP header injection: The programs do not properly sanitize or validate the redirect parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The ability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers can lead to various security issues such as:
    - Session hijacking via Set-Cookie header injection
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Content-Type manipulation
    - Cache poisoning
    - Other attacks that leverage the ability to control headers

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting malicious URLs with crafted `success` or `failure` parameters, an attacker can inject HTTP headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable cgiemail or cgiecho application. This likely involves being able to provide manipulated query parameters to the application's URL.
