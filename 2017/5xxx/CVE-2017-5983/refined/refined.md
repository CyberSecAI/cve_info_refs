Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5983:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2017-5983 as being assigned to Atlassian JIRA versions 4.2.4 prior to 6.3.0 due to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities within the JIRA Workflow Designer Plugin, which confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insecure deserialization of AMF3 (Action Message Format version 3) data in multiple Java implementations, specifically affecting how the *flash.utils.IExternalizable* interface is handled. Instead of adhering to the AMF3 specification, implementations were using Java's *java.io.Externalizable*. Additionally, vulnerabilities stem from the way the XML parser and deserializer were implemented within JIRA, and how AMF3 implementations handle the *dynamic* trait.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   -   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Vulnerable AMF3 deserializers allow instantiation of classes from *java.io.Externalizable* rather than the *flash.utils.IExternalizable*. This enables attackers to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized.
   -   **CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources:** AMF3 deserializers allow instantiation of arbitrary classes through their public parameter-less constructor and calling arbitrary Java Bean setter methods, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
   -   **CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE'):** Vulnerable AMF3 deserializers allow XML external entity references (XXEs) from XML documents embedded within AMF3 messages, potentially exposing sensitive data, causing denial of service, or enabling server-side request forgery.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   -   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By sending crafted serialized Java objects, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
   -   **Disclosure of Private Files:** XXE vulnerabilities can be exploited to access sensitive files on the server.
   -   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Improper XML parsing and resource consumption can lead to denial of service.
   -   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** XXE vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to make requests to internal or external services.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   -   **Spoofing/Controlling RMI Server Connections:** Attackers can spoof or control RMI server connections to send malicious serialized Java objects.
   -   **Sending Crafted AMF3 Messages:** Attackers send specially crafted AMF3 messages containing serialized malicious objects or XML payloads.
   -   **Exploiting public parameter-less constructors and Java Beans setters** by sending serialized Java objects with preset properties that lead to code execution during deserialization.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   -   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
   -   **Ability to Send AMF3 Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send AMF3 messages to the vulnerable application.
   -  **For RMI related attacks:** The attacker needs to be able to spoof or control an RMI server connection.
   -   **For XXE:** The attacker needs to be able to send AMF3 messages with embedded XML containing malicious external entity references.
   -   **For Java Bean setter exploitation:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of available classes within the classpath that can be exploited during deserialization.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   **Specific Implementations Affected:** The analysis provides detailed information about affected libraries, including Adobe/Apache Flex BlazeDS, Flamingo amf-serializer, GraniteDS, and WebORB for Java, including specific version numbers.
*   **RMI Deserialization:** The analysis describes a specific technique of using `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef` and `sun.rmi.transport.LiveRef` to trigger `ObjectInputStream.readObject` through `Externalizable.readExternal`, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code by deserializing objects from the attacker.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Besides upgrading, the document discusses the importance of using updated JDKs, being suspicious of deserialized data, and implementing firewall rules.
*   **Atlassian Specifics:** The Atlassian advisory specifies that versions of JIRA Server from 4.2.4 up to but not including 6.3.0 are vulnerable. This vulnerability was tracked under [JRA-64077](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-64077)
*   **Vendor Responses**: The document also provides information on vendor responses and mitigations, where available.

In summary, CVE-2017-5983 is due to a complex set of vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization and XXE within AMF3 implementations, allowing remote attackers to execute code, expose sensitive data, or cause a denial of service on affected systems.
