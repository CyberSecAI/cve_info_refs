The provided content includes a knowledge base article detailing resolved issues in Novell iManager 2.7 and eDirectory 8.8. It indicates that CVE-2017-5186 is related to a fix in eDirectory 8.8 SP8 Patch 9 Hotfix 2, specifically impacting the NetIQ Audit connector's ability to connect with Sentinel 7.4.2 and above.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of an embedded private key by auditing components to connect over SSL to Sentinel servers. This embedded certificate was no longer compatible with Java 1.8, which is required for newer Sentinel versions (7.4.2 and above).
*   The issue requires modification of several components, including eDirectory, iManager, Platform Agent (PA), IDM, and RBPM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Certificate:** The use of an outdated, embedded certificate within the auditing components.
*   **Dependency on Java Version:** The vulnerability was exposed by incompatibility with newer Java versions (1.8).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Auditing:** The primary impact is the inability of NetIQ Audit connector to establish connections with Sentinel servers which may prevent proper security monitoring

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploited via traditional attacks, rather due to incompatibility with newer java versions, breaking intercommunication between the auditing component and a SIEM solution

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   No specific attacker capabilities are required as this is an incompatibility that does not require direct exploitation.
