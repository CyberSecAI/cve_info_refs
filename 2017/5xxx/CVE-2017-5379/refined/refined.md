{
  "CVE-2017-5379": {
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Web Animations when interacting with cycle collection found through fuzzing.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs in the `mozilla::dom::Element::GetAnimations` function, which is part of the Web Animations implementation in Gecko.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "This vulnerability can lead to a potentially exploitable crash, which could be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting malicious web content that manipulates Web Animations and triggers cycle collection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious web content that can trigger the vulnerable code path in the Web Animations implementation. Fuzzing techniques were used to uncover the vulnerability.",
     "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs when the `Element::GetAnimations` function attempts to access a DOM element that has already been freed from memory. This occurs because the call to `FlushPendingNotifications()` within `Element::GetAnimations()` can invoke callbacks that result in the document being replaced and the element becoming invalid. This scenario highlights the danger of mixing style flushing with direct DOM access."

 "CVE-2017-5378": {
    "Description": "Hashed codes of JavaScript objects are shared between pages. This allows for pointer leaks because an object’s address can be discovered through hash codes, and also allows for data leakage of an object’s content using these hash codes.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that hash codes of JavaScript objects are derived from their memory addresses and these hash codes are shared between different pages and frames. An attacker can use this to deduce the memory layout of objects and leak information, such as the address of an object, and also allows for data leakage of an object’s content using these hash codes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
       "ASLR bypass" ,
       "Cross-frame oracle"
    ],
    "Impact": "This vulnerability allows for address space layout randomization (ASLR) bypass and cross-frame information leakage, potentially allowing an attacker to gain knowledge of the memory layout and content of objects in other frames, leading to further exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious web pages or using cross-frame communication to access shared hash codes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to load malicious web pages or interact with other frames. The attacker would need knowledge of the hash code generation process and the structure of objects in memory.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `ScrambleHashCode` function scrambles the memory addresses of JavaScript objects and strings in a way that is not sufficiently secure, allowing an attacker to reconstruct parts of the memory address by measuring performance effects of hash code collisions. Atoms (interned strings) are shared across frames, so an attacker can use this to check if a specific string is used in another frame, allowing for cross-origin information leaks. The fix implemented a new two-argument `SecureScrambleHashCode` and used this in all hash calculations that involved objects and strings. For strings, the fix added a new hashcode to atoms that is used instead of the pointer address."
