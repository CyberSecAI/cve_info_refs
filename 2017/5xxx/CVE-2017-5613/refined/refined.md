Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the ability to supply arbitrary format strings to the `cgiemail` and `cgiecho` programs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a format string injection flaw. This occurs when user-supplied input is used as a format string in functions like `printf` without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the format string injection vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves providing a crafted CGI template file to `cgiemail` or `cgiecho`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a CGI template file to `cgiemail` or `cgiecho` for the vulnerability to be exploited. This indicates a scenario where the attacker has some control over the input provided to these programs, such as through a web interface or other means.

**Summary**
The provided document details a format string injection vulnerability in `cgiemail` and `cgiecho`. This vulnerability arises from the programs' handling of template files and allows an attacker to execute code through crafted template files. The attacker must have the ability to supply a template file to exploit the vulnerability.
