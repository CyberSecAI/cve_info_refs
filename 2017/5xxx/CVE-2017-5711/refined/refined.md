Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-5711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Multiple buffer overflows within the Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This means that the software does not properly validate or limit the size of data being written to a memory buffer, which could lead to writing past the end of the buffer and corrupting other memory.
- Multiple privilege escalations that may lead to unauthenticated access to sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Attackers with local access can exploit these buffer overflows to execute arbitrary code.
- **System Instability:** Exploitation could lead to system crashes or general instability.
- **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, bypassing security feature attestation validity.
-  **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with local access can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Data Access:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Remote access is required for CVE-2017-5712.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  **Local Access:** An attacker needs physical or logical access to the system.
-  **High Privileges:** Some vulnerabilities require the attacker to have high privileges on the local machine.

**Additional Details**
- The advisory from Netapp mentions that no Netapp products ship with affected versions of the firmware, but it acknowledges the existence of the vulnerabilities.
- The Siemens advisory provides details about specific products that are affected, such as SIMATIC Industrial PCs, and provides links to obtain updates. It also specifies the affected ME versions for various products and outlines workarounds for some of the vulnerabilities.
- The ASUS advisory provides a list of affected motherboards and ways to obtain the necessary firmware updates (either through a specific ME update tool or through BIOS updates).

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score (Siemens):** 6.7
**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C

This CVSS vector translates to:
- **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The vulnerability requires local access.
- **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.
- **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker needs administrative-level access.
- **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required.
- **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component.
- **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** The impact on confidentiality is high.
- **I:H (Integrity: High):** The impact on integrity is high.
- **A:H (Availability: High):** The impact on availability is high.
- **E:P (Exploit Code Maturity: Proof-of-Concept):** Exploit code is available but might be in an early stage
- **RL:O (Remediation Level: Official Fix):** Official fix is available
- **RC:C (Report Confidence: Confirmed):** The report is confirmed
