```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `html_context_handle_element` function within the samiparse module of gstreamer-plugins-base. Specifically, the code attempts to read one byte beyond the allocated buffer when handling certain HTML elements in a SAMI subtitle file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Heap out-of-bounds read.

Impact of exploitation:
- A successful exploit could potentially crash applications using the GStreamer framework.

Attack vectors:
- By providing a specially crafted SAMI subtitle file containing specific HTML elements, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted SAMI subtitle file to an application using the vulnerable GStreamer library. This might involve tricking a user into opening the file, or providing the malicious file to an automated system that processes such files.
