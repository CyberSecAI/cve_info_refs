Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-5356:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the `format_expand_styles` function in Irssi. This function handles formatting sequences, particularly the ` %[...] ` sequence, which executes timestamp and "line_start" commands. The scanner within `format_expand_styles` expects a closing bracket `]`, but if the end of the string is reached before this bracket, the code isn't prepared to handle this situation. This leads to advancing the `char*` pointer beyond the end of the string, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-126 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The primary vulnerability is the out-of-bounds read due to incorrect handling of the format string parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (Remote Crash):** The vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service condition due to a crash of the Irssi client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered when the Irssi client processes a formatting string containing the ` %[` sequence without a closing `]` before the end of string is reached. This can occur when the client receives specially crafted IRC messages or processes specially crafted output from a script.
   -  According to Hanno Böck, this vulnerability is triggered when a script outputs the sequence, but not when a user types it directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send messages (either directly through a channel or via a bot/script that has access to Irssi). Control over the ircd (IRC server) is *not* explicitly required to trigger this vulnerability, as a user can trigger it themselves.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Hanno Böck.
- This issue was fixed in Irssi versions 0.8.21 and 1.0.0.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user with control of scripts or a remote user sending formatted messages.
