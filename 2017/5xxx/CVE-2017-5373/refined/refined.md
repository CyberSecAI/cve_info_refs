*   Gentoo Security Advisory: "GLSA 201702-13", "GLSA 201702-22"

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause is a collection of memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. These bugs exhibited evidence of memory corruption, which could potentially be exploited. Specific issues include memory safety errors and use-after-free conditions. The vulnerabilities were identified by multiple Mozilla developers and community members.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Memory Safety Bugs:** A variety of memory corruption bugs are referenced. These bugs could be caused by issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free conditions, or double-free issues.
*   **Potential Use-after-free:** Some of the identified bugs point to specific use-after-free conditions.
*  **Excessive JIT Code Allocation:**  JIT code allocation could allow for a bypass of ASLR and DEP protections leading to potential memory corruption attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected software.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could cause memory corruption, which could lead to crashes and denial-of-service conditions, or be a step to achieving code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Malformed Web Content:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through specially crafted web content. 
*  **Email:** A specially crafted email could exploit the vulnerability (although less likely, as Javascript is disabled when reading mail)

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Remote:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by enticing the user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious email.
*  **Limited Capabilities needed:** The attacker needs to deliver the malformed content to a vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
* The identified memory safety bugs were present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6, and fixed in Firefox 51 and Firefox ESR 45.7.
* Patches were provided by Mozilla and backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Thunderbird and Debian.
* Several reporters are acknowledged, indicating the bugs came from different sources.
* Mozilla specifically names Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Andr√© Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol as reporters for the issues covered by CVE-2017-5373.
