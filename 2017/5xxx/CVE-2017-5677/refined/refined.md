Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `HTML_AJAX_Serializer_PHP` class within the PEAR HTML_AJAX package. This class uses the `unserialize()` PHP function to handle user-controlled input when the Content-Type header is set to "application/php-serialized". The class attempts to restrict unserialization of arbitrary classes by extracting class names from the serialized string using a regular expression and comparing them against a list of allowed classes. However, a flawed regular expression allows attackers to bypass this check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a PHP Object Injection flaw. The `unserialize()` function in PHP is vulnerable to object injection when it processes untrusted input, allowing the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `_getSerializedClassNames()` method, responsible for extracting class names from the serialized string, uses an insecure regular expression (`/O:[0-9]+:"(.*)"/U`). Attackers can bypass the class name check by modifying the serialized string from "O:X" to "O:+X", where X is the length of the class name. This allows arbitrary classes to be unserialized.
*  **Insecure Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` on user-controlled data without proper validation leads to insecure deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary PHP Object Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope.
*   **POP Chain Attacks:** This allows attackers to perform "Property-Oriented Programming" (POP) chain attacks. By carefully crafting a chain of object instantiations and method calls, they can achieve unintended code execution.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to trigger memory corruption issues within PHP's serialization internals, leading to further exploits.
*   **Remote Code Execution (potential):**  Combined with other vulnerabilities, such as those related to GMP deserialization or magic methods in the DB_common class of PEAR packages, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution on the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to an application using the vulnerable HTML_AJAX package, with the "Content-Type" header set to `application/php-serialized`. The POST body contains a malicious, serialized PHP object, with the class name bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of PHP Serialization:** The attacker needs to understand how PHP serialization works to craft the malicious serialized object.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in PEAR HTML_AJAX versions 0.3.0 to 0.5.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.5.8.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a PHP Object Injection flaw due to insecure deserialization of user-controlled data. An attacker can bypass class name restrictions and inject arbitrary PHP objects by exploiting a flawed regular expression, leading to potential code execution and other severe impacts.
