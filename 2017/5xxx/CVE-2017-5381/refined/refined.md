  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-5381",
    "description": "The \"export\" function in the Certificate Viewer can force local filesystem navigation when the \"common name\" in a certificate contains slashes, allowing certificate content to be saved in unsafe locations with an arbitrary filename.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Certificate Viewer's export function uses the certificate's Common Name (CN) directly in the suggested filename for saving the certificate. When the CN contains slashes (/) it leads to the file saving dialog navigating to arbitrary file system locations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized user-controlled input in file operations.",
        "Improper path handling during file export."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use a specially crafted certificate with slashes in its CN to force the certificate export function to save the certificate to an arbitrary location in the local filesystem, potentially overwriting or creating configuration files, among others.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can create a malicious certificate with slashes in its CN and then trick a user into viewing the certificate in the certificate viewer and attempt to export the certificate.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a certificate with a malicious CN, and trick the user into exporting this certificate from the browser's certificate viewer.",
      "attacker_positioning": "The attacker could be in any position capable of serving or having the victim obtain such a certificate."
