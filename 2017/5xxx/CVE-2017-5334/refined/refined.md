Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in GnuTLS when parsing X.509 certificates containing the "Proxy Certificate Information" extension. Specifically, if the policy language is set but the policy itself is absent, a double-free occurs when the returned value is freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Double-free vulnerability: The same memory is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The double-free can cause the application linked against GnuTLS to crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: Memory corruption vulnerabilities such as double-frees can potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: An attacker can craft a malicious X.509 certificate with the "Proxy Certificate Information" extension and send it to a vulnerable application.
- Application-specific: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious certificate. Any software using GnuTLS for certificate handling can be susceptible if it is parsing certificates from untrusted sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft X.509 certificates with malicious "Proxy Certificate Information" extensions.
- Ability to deliver the crafted certificate to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in `gnutls_x509_ext_import_proxy` function.
- The fix involves checking if the policy is set before freeing the value to prevent double free.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was identified by the OSS-Fuzz project.
- The vulnerability was fixed in GnuTLS versions 3.3.26 and 3.5.8.
- Red Hat also released security advisories (e.g., RHSA-2017:2292) and patches to address this issue.
