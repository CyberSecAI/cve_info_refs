Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5953:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in memory allocation when processing a corrupted spell file. Specifically, the length of a tree structure within the spell file is read, and this length is later used to allocate memory. If the length value is maliciously crafted to be excessively large, multiplying it with `sizeof(int)` can lead to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the length value read from the spell file. This allows for an attacker to provide an extremely large value which results in an integer overflow during memory allocation calculations.
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The integer overflow results in allocation of a smaller buffer than required, leading to a subsequent buffer overflow when the data is written to the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running Vim or gVim, due to the buffer overflow.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Spell File:** The attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted spell file using Vim or gVim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious spell file**: An attacker needs to be able to generate a spell file with a crafted length value to trigger the integer overflow.
- **Social Engineering/User Interaction**: The attacker must persuade a user to open this crafted spell file using a vulnerable version of Vim or gVim. This typically requires a user to manually open the file or have a plugin/script attempt to load the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for an invalid length before the memory allocation occurs, preventing the integer overflow and subsequent buffer overflow. The fix checks if `len >= 0x3ffffff` (or `len > ULONG_MAX / sizeof(int)`) .
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of Vim and gVim prior to 8.0.0386.
- Multiple sources confirm that the issue affects multiple distributions of Linux including Debian and Ubuntu.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and it was fixed by applying a patch.
