Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2017-5870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the ViMbAdmin web application. Specifically, user-supplied data is not being sanitized before being used in HTML output, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   Vulnerable parameters include `domain` and `transport` in the domain creation form.
    *   Vulnerable parameter `name` in the mailbox creation form.
    *    Vulnerable parameter `goto` in the alias creation form.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   Vulnerable parameter `captchatext` on the reset password page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing user credentials.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing other unauthorized actions within the application context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **Injection via forms**: Malicious JavaScript code is injected via multiple forms including the domain creation, mailbox creation, alias creation, and password reset forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ViMbAdmin instance.
*   For stored XSS, the attacker needs to be logged in with high privileges to access and utilize forms.
*   For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to trick a user to visit a crafted link.
