The provided content relates to CVE-2017-5869.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the Nuxeo Platform does not properly validate the `X-File-Name` header during file uploads. Specifically, the `org.nuxeo.ecm.restapi.server.jaxrs.BatchUploadObject` class does not check this header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434)
- Path Traversal

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload to the server file system
- Remote code execution by uploading and executing a JSP file
- Full compromise of the server

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Exploiting the file upload feature via a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-File-Name` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user access to the Nuxeo Platform.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to `/site/automation/batch/upload`
- Knowledge of the vulnerable `X-File-Name` header
