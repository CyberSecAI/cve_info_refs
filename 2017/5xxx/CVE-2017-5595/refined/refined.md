Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from unfiltered user input being passed to the `readfile()` function in the `views/file.php` file of ZoneMinder. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose local files on the server. By manipulating the `path` parameter, an attacker can force the application to read and output the contents of any file accessible to the web server user.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows path traversal using `../` sequences in the `path` parameter. This enables attackers to access files outside the intended web root directory.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-provided file path before using it in the `readfile()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), and other application data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Disclosing sensitive information can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/zm/index.php` endpoint.
- **`path` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `path` parameter to specify the file they wish to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the ZoneMinder application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ZoneMinder server.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code resides in `views/file.php`, specifically the part that uses `readfile()` with user-controlled input.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) URL is: `http://<serverIP>/zm/index.php?view=file&path=/../../../../../etc/passwd`. This URL demonstrates reading the `/etc/passwd` file using path traversal.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in the commit: `https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/commit/8b19fca9927cdec07cc9dd09bdcf2496a5ae69b3`. This commit appears to address the vulnerability by sanitizing the file path before it is used. The fix is applied to `web/views/image.php`, which had similar logic as `web/views/file.php`. The file `web/views/file.php` is removed.
