Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5610:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the "Press This" feature in WordPress. The user interface (UI) for assigning taxonomy terms (like categories and tags) was being displayed to users who did not possess the necessary permissions to actually use or assign those terms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Check:** The primary weakness was a flaw in the permission check for displaying the taxonomy assignment UI in the "Press This" feature. This allowed unauthorized users to view options they shouldn't have access to.
*   **UI Exposure:** The vulnerability is a result of the UI being exposed to users without the appropriate capabilities/permissions, implying a lack of proper access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** While not a direct data breach, it exposed UI elements (specifically the taxonomy term assignment options) to users who shouldn't see them.
*   **Potential Confusion:** The unauthorized display of these UI elements could potentially confuse users about their permissions and capabilities within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Press This:** An attacker (a WordPress user without the `assign_terms` capability for categories and tags) needs only to access the "Press This" feature to see the unauthorized UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User:** The attacker must be a registered user on a WordPress site.
*   **Insufficient Permissions:** They must *not* have the `assign_terms` capability for taxonomies (categories and tags).

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved adding checks to verify the user's permissions before displaying the taxonomy UI. This was implemented in the `class-wp-press-this.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Herrera of Alley Interactive.
*   This issue was addressed in WordPress version 4.7.2.

In summary, CVE-2017-5610 is a permissions-related vulnerability in the "Press This" feature of WordPress. The UI for assigning taxonomy terms was improperly exposed to users without the required permissions. This could lead to confusion and unauthorized information disclosure within the application.
