Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper use of stack memory for DMA buffers in the `hid-corsair` driver. Specifically, the driver was allocating DMA buffers on the stack, which is not universally supported, especially with the `VMAP_STACK` option enabled on x86 architectures since Linux kernel v4.9.  This means that the stack memory may not be physically contiguous.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **DMA to Stack:** The primary vulnerability is that the driver was allocating DMA buffers on the stack. DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations require physically contiguous memory, while stack memory might be virtually mapped and not physically contiguous, leading to potential errors when the hardware attempts to access it.
- **Incorrect Buffer Size:** The macro-mode buffer was also larger than necessary. This could contribute to other potential issues, though it's not the primary vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. If the driver attempts to perform DMA to a non-contiguous stack address, it can lead to a system crash (kernel panic).
- **Memory Corruption:** The description in the CVE request mentions "potential silent or not so silent memory corruption when it's not [CONFIG_DEBUG_SG or CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL enabled]". If the kernel stack is mapped to non-contiguous physical pages, a DMA operation targeting the stack could end up writing to a completely unrelated physical page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker would need local access to the system in order to interact with the Corsair HID device and trigger the vulnerable code path within the `hid-corsair` driver. 
- **Device Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with a specific Corsair keyboard model (Vengeance K90) via USB, which causes the driver to perform the vulnerable DMA operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on a system with a vulnerable Linux kernel.
- **Physical Access (Potentially):** The attacker needs to have the specific Corsair keyboard model (Vengeance K90) physically connected to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Fix:** The provided patch allocates the data buffer on the heap using `kmalloc` rather than using stack memory and frees it via `kfree`.
- **Context:** This issue is related to the introduction of the `VMAP_STACK` kernel option, which changes how stack memory is managed.
- **Affected Versions:** Linux kernel versions >= 4.9 are likely affected if the `CONFIG_VMAP_STACK` option is enabled. However, the vulnerability was introduced by code added in commit `6f78193ee9ea` which was then fixed by the provided commit `6d104af38b570d37aa32a5803b04c354f8ed513d`.
