Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-5196:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `term_addstr` function when copying characters to the terminal screen. The function uses `g_utf8_get_char` unconditionally without validating if the input string is valid UTF-8. `g_utf8_get_char` has undefined behavior for invalid input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Out-of-bounds read:  Due to the unchecked use of `g_utf8_get_char` with invalid UTF-8 input, the function could attempt to read beyond the bounds of the provided input string causing a crash.
*   Improper input validation:  The `term_addstr` function does not validate the provided character sequences before using `g_utf8_get_char`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service:  The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash of the irssi client, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to control the input string being processed by the `term_addstr` function. This input is displayed on the terminal screen.
*   This may involve sending a crafted message to the Irssi client that includes malformed UTF-8 sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the Irssi client that will be processed and displayed.
*   This likely means the attacker needs to have a presence on an IRC server which a vulnerable Irssi client is connected to, and be able to send the crafted messages.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was independently discovered by Hanno BÃ¶ck and Joseph Bisch.
*   The fix replaces `g_utf8_get_char` with `g_utf8_get_char_validated` to ensure proper UTF-8 input validation.
*   The issue affects Irssi versions 0.8.18 and later.
