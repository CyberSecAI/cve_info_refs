  "CVE-2017-5392": {
    "Description": "Weak proxy objects have weak references on multiple threads when they should only have them on one, resulting in incorrect memory usage and corruption, which leads to potentially exploitable crashes. This issue only affects Firefox for Android.",
    "Root cause": "The `nsWindow::LayerViewSupport` class uses weak references across multiple threads, violating the single-threaded usage requirement of the `WeakPtr` class.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect usage of weak references across multiple threads, leading to potential race conditions and memory corruption."
    ],
    "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crashes due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation would require triggering the multi-threaded usage of the weak reference within the `nsWindow::LayerViewSupport` class.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to cause the specific multi-threaded code path to be executed. No specific position/capabilities are stated."
  }
