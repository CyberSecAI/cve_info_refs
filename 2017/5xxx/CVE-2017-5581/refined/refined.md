{
  "CVE-2017-5581": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in ModifiablePixelBuffer::fillRect in vncviewer was found allowing a malicious VNC server to send a crafted RRE message and potentially take control of the TigerVNC viewer.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking in the `ModifiablePixelBuffer::fillRect` function when processing RRE messages, leading to a buffer overflow when a subrectangle is defined outside the framebuffer boundaries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious VNC server could send a crafted RRE message to the client, leading to memory corruption or a crash of the vncviewer process. This could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the client machine, or a denial of service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via a malicious VNC server sending a specially crafted RRE message to the client.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a VNC server and be able to send arbitrary RRE messages to a vulnerable client."
