- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with a malicious `addendum` parameter, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when the user visits the URL.
