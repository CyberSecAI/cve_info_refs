- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `MakeDay` function within `jsdate.c` when parsing crafted JavaScript input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code calculates an index based on user input without proper validation, which can result in an invalid memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a segmentation fault, which can be used to perform a denial of service. The Valgrind output shows an invalid read of size 8 bytes which leads to a crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing malicious JavaScript code. The provided proof of concept (PoC) is: `new Date(1, Date).l`. This input triggers the integer overflow in the `MakeDay` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious JavaScript input to the MuJS JavaScript engine. This might be through a website or another application using the vulnerable code.
