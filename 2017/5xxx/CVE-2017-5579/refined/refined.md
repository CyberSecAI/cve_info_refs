CVE-2017-5579: Qemu: serial: host memory leakage 16550A UART emulation

Root cause of vulnerability:
- Qemu built with the 16550A UART serial device emulation support is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Memory Leakage

Impact of exploitation:
- Doing a device unplug operation repeatedly would result in leaking host memory, affecting other services on the host.
- A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.

Attack vectors:
- A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host by repeatedly doing a device unplug operation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Privileged user inside guest OS.
