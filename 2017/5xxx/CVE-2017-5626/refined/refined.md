```
{
  "CVE-2017-5626": {
    "Root cause": "The bootloader contains a fastboot command (`fastboot oem 4F500301`) that bypasses the bootloader's lock state by setting a global flag that overrides lock state checks during flashing and erasing partitions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Missing authentication for critical operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass the bootloader lock, flash malicious images (boot/recovery), and gain kernel code execution. This allows for arbitrary code execution with root privileges, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete device control.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the device",
      "ADB/fastboot access"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have physical access to the device or remote access via ADB/fastboot interface."
