The Micro Focus Parties are third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Website Terms of Use that reference them.

#### Governing Law and Venue

These Website Terms of Use and disputes arising hereunder will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. You and We irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consent to venue in the State of Delaware and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Delaware and (ii) waive any claims of forum non conveniens with respect to such venue. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Website Terms of Use.

#### Dispute Resolution

The procedures set forth in this Article will apply to any dispute, controversy or claim, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or relating hereto ("Dispute") and will be the sole and exclusive procedures in connection with any such Dispute. You and We irrevocably waive any right to commence any action in or before any governmental authority, except as expressly provided in these Website Terms of Use, and except to the extent provided under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, YOU AND WE IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY TRIAL IN A COURT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY DISPUTE.

Except as provided below, all Disputes shall be resolved through mandatory and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, State of California before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude Us from seeking equitable remedies as set forth below. The prevailing party in any legal proceeding shall recover its expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable attorney's fees. Except as required by applicable Law, the existence, content and result of all Dispute resolution proceedings will be confidential and will not be disclosed (other than to the extent required to enforce any agreement or award). You and We will each request that the arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement.

You acknowledge that, in the event You breach (or attempt or threaten to breach) Your obligations regarding Our intellectual property, We may be irreparably harmed and may proceed immediately to seek equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction should find that You have breached (or attempted or threatened to breach) any such obligations, You agree that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, You will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling Your performance and restraining You from any further breaches (or attempted or threatened breaches).

#### Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer

Our Websites contain forward-looking statements that are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties associated with, among other items, the changing economic and business conditions in the countries, sectors and business segments in which We operate. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, e.g., numerous assumptions regarding Our present and future business strategies and the environments in which We operate. They are not guarantees and may prove inaccurate. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Please do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by any applicable laws or regulations.

#### Miscellaneous

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Website Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Website Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, You nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Website Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Website Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Website Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of Your use of Our Website.

# [R2] NetIQ Sentinel Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

[NetIQ Sentinel](https://www.netiq.com/products/sentinel/) is a “full-featured Security Information and Event Management solution”. One of the features the SIEM offers is a Java web start client. The client is downloaded via port 8443 and the client connects to port 10013, both of which are accessible even when Sentinel’s firewall is enabled.

Web Start Client: Account Enumeration

The web start client appears to use a custom protocol to connect to the Sentinel server. The protocol is a mix of binary type/length and XML payloads. Additionally, the protocol features multiple “channels”. For example, to log into Sentinel via the web start client requires two separate SSL connections. The authentication request gets sent on the first channel and the response comes back on the second channel.

One thing we noticed when looking at the web client is that the server responds differently to an authentication request for an account that exists versus an account that doesn’t. For example, if an attacker tries to authenticate as the non-existent “*lolwat*” user, then Sentinel replies with “*No account named ‘lolwat’ exists.*” Whereas if an attacker tries to authenticate with the default “`admin`” account, Sentinel will respond to a bad password with “*DBLogin: Authentication Failed: FATAL: password authentication failed for user ‘admin’*”. This is obviously a concern as seen in the first example of [CWE-203](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html): Information Exposure Through Discrepancy. Tenable has created a PoC to demonstrate this issue. In the output below we use “`is_valid_account.py`” three times for the accounts “`admin`” (valid), “`lolwat`” (not valid), and “`albinolobster`” (valid):

```

```

Bringing Down the House

In implementing the above PoC, we quickly learned that Sentinel is vulnerable to a handful of denial of service attacks. Specifically, it is fairly easy for an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the server to exceed the Java VM memory limit which triggers an `OutofMemory` exception. This causes the JVM to be shutdown and restarted which disables both the web UI (port 8443) and the web start server. In the server wrapper log, the exception, shutdown, and restart look like this:

```

```

We’ve provided two PoCs for crashing the Sentinel server via memory exhaustion. One uses packet type 9 to trigger the exhaustion and the other users packet type 3. The PoCs are named “`type9_dos.py`” and “`type3_dos.py`”. The output looks like this:

```

```

### Solution

Micro Focus originally released NetIQ Sentinel version 8.0.1 which addresses these issues. However, CVE-2017-5184 was not effectively patched until 8.1.0.
