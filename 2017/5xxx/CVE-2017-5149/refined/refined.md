- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The communication channel between the St. Jude Medical Merlin@home transmitter and Merlin.net does not properly verify the identities of the endpoints, leading to a man-in-the-middle vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Channel accessible by non-endpoint ('Man-in-the-middle') vulnerability (CWE-300). Specifically, the lack of endpoint verification in the communication channel between the transmitter and St. Jude Medicalâ€™s web site.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could access or influence communications between Merlin.net and transmitter endpoints. This could potentially allow manipulation of data or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would need to be positioned such that they could intercept and manipulate communications between the transmitter and the Merlin.net server. The attacker needs high technical skill to exploit this vulnerability.
