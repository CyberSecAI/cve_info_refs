{
  "CVE-2017-5669": {
    "description": "Gareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a set-UID program.",
    "root_cause": "The `shmat()` system call, when used with `MAP_FIXED`, allowed mapping memory at address 0, bypassing the null page protection mechanisms that are in place for the regular mmap calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent null page protection between `shmat()` and `mmap()` system calls.",
      "The `shmat()` function with `MAP_FIXED` did not properly validate the requested address (specifically, address 0) before mapping memory, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference."
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user could map memory at address 0, which can be leveraged to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities, potentially allowing privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access to the system is required to execute the `shmat()` system call.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have local privileged access (e.g., root user) to execute the vulnerable `shmat()` system call."
