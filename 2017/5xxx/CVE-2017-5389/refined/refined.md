{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "WebExtensions were able to use the `mozAddonManager` API to install additional add-ons by modifying the CSP headers on sites with the appropriate permissions and then using host requests to redirect script loads to a malicious site.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient control over WebExtension's ability to modify Content Security Policy (CSP) headers",
      "Lack of restriction on WebExtension's control over host requests on sites with `mozAddonManager` permissions",
        "Inadequate validation of the origin of requests made by WebExtensions."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious WebExtension could install additional extensions without explicit user permission. This could lead to privilege escalation and further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious WebExtension modifies CSP headers on a site with `mozAddonManager` permissions.",
      "The malicious extension redirects script loads to a malicious site.",
        "The malicious site then uses the `mozAddonManager` API to install additional extensions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious WebExtension and have it installed by the user."
