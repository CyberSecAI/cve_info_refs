Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the internal feed reader APIs of Mozilla Firefox. These APIs, designed to handle communication between the main browser process and sandboxed processes, incorrectly crossed the sandbox barrier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Escape:** The primary weakness was the ability to bypass the sandbox.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The vulnerable API could be used to escalate privileges if combined with another vulnerability.
- **Insecure IPC:** The inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism used by the feed reader allowed a sandboxed process to influence operations in a higher-privileged process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could escape the sandbox, gaining access to resources that a sandboxed process should not be able to access.
- With an additional vulnerability allowing remote code execution within the sandbox, this could lead to full system compromise.
- The provided data details how the feed reader, specifically the ability for the child process to change preferences, could lead to code execution via nsIShellService.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack involves a malicious actor using specially crafted web content to trigger a message through the feed reader API. This message is sent from the sandboxed content process to the privileged main process.
- The attacker can send crafted messages to the vulnerable API that would normally be limited to the parent process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious content to a user. This is typically done by the victim visiting a malicious webpage or by getting them to open a malicious file.
- If combined with a remote code execution vulnerability, a attacker would need to have that ability to get code running inside the sandboxed process.
