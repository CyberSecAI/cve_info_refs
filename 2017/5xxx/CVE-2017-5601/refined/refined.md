Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `lha_read_file_header_1()` function within the libarchive library.
* The issue arises from improper handling of the `compsize` variable which represents the compressed file size during the processing of LHA archive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability exists because of an incorrect calculation of the `compsize` variable leading to a negative value. Specifically, the code calculates `lha->compsize -= extdsize - 2;` without properly validating `extdsize`, allowing the result to become negative. This negative value is then used to determine the size of the buffer to read, potentially causing an out of bound access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of service (application crash):** By providing a specially crafted LHA archive file, an attacker could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application using libarchive to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious LHA archive file:** The attack vector is providing a crafted LHA archive file with a specially crafted header that leads to the incorrect calculation of the compressed file size. This crafted file is then processed by an application that uses the vulnerable libarchive library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Ability to provide input to libarchive:** An attacker needs to be able to supply an archive file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of the libarchive library. This could occur through various means such as uploading the file to a web application, or via direct file processing.

**Additional Details:**
* The fix was implemented by adding a check to ensure `lha->compsize` is not less than zero. Specifically `if (lha->compsize < 0) goto invalid;` was added in the code.
* The vulnerability was reported in Secunia SA74169.
* The Debian Security Advisory DLA-1600-1 explicitly lists CVE-2017-5601 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the update.
* The vulnerability is related to processing LHA archive files, and is present in `libarchive/archive_read_support_format_lha.c`.
