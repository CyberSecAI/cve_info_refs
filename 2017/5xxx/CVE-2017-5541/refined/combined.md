## Description

[![@Xyntax](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12861404?u=247d1e91cd5cd60e46db0fd0e787a167cff8b455&v=4&size=48)](/Xyntax)[Xyntax](https://github.com/Xyntax)opened [on Jan 17, 2017](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphonycms/issues/2639#issue-201168413)
## File Manipulation

<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/template/usererror.missing_extension.php#L15>

```
@rename(EXTENSIONS . '/' . $_POST['existing-folder'], EXTENSIONS . '/' . $_POST['new-folder']))

```

Data from $\_POST is passed directly into filepath, attacker may control filepath with injecting `../`.

## Cross Site Scripting

<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/template/usererror.missing_extension.php#L18>

```
$name = $_POST['existing-folder'];
...
Symphony::Engine()->throwCustomError(
                __('Could not find extension %s at location %s.', array(
                    '<code>' . $name . '</code>',
                    '<code>' . $path . '</code>'
                )),

```

Here data from `$_POST` to HTML allows attacker to trigger an XSS with payload llike `existing-folder=</code><script>xxx</script>`
