The provided content relates to CVE-2017-5541.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `usererror.missing_extension.php` template in Symphony CMS directly uses user-supplied input from `$_POST` without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Path Traversal:** The `$_POST['existing-folder']` and `$_POST['new-folder']` parameters are used directly in a `rename()` function to manipulate file paths. By injecting `../` sequences into these parameters, an attacker can potentially rename files or directories outside the intended `EXTENSIONS` directory.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `$_POST['existing-folder']` parameter is used in an error message output without proper escaping. By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>...</script>`) into this parameter, an attacker can trigger an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Path Traversal:** Arbitrary file/directory renaming/manipulation on the server filesystem, potentially leading to data loss, denial of service or privilege escalation.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:** Execution of arbitrary Javascript in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests containing malicious input in `existing-folder` and `new-folder` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `existing-folder` and `new-folder` parameters. No specific authentication or privilege is specified in the provided text, therefore it can be assumed that these vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
