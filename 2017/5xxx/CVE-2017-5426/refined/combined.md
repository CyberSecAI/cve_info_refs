## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

Back in [bug 969040](/show_bug.cgi?id=969040 "RESOLVED FIXED - seccomp sandboxing doesn't affect non-main threads already started") / [bug 970676](/show_bug.cgi?id=970676 "RESOLVED FIXED - bionic doesn't setuid() on threads"), I dealt with needing to start seccomp-bpf after the process is already multithreaded by sending a signal to each thread to do the prctl() call for itself, because seccomp state is (like most things in Linux) per-thread. And, because threads could clone themselves while this is happening, I had the signal pseudo-broadcast repeat until all threads found themselves already sandboxed.
Problem is, I used PR\_GET\_SECCOMP, which returns 2 if the thread has one or more seccomp-bpf filters applied, which is not the same as whether it has \*our\* filter applied. If Firefox is started with a seccomp-bpf filter already applied, that's inherited by child processes/threads, and the plugin-container threads will all think they have nothing to do and leave threads unsandboxed. (I haven't tested this yet, but I'm pretty sure that's what will happen.)
In particular, LXC apparently runs containers with a seccomp-bpf filter applied to everything. I don't know if this applies to all uses of containers -- it would be useful to know what the Docker containers we're using for TaskCluster do, in particular.
This shouldn't be a problem on kernels that have thread sync support ([bug 1004011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1004011 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support SECCOMP_FILTER_TSYNC if available")), but that conjecture is also not tested yet.
If unprivileged user namespaces are available… probably GeckoMediaPlugins will completely break, because we'll chroot to a deleted directory before calling dlopen(), and without seccomp-bpf to intercept the open() call it will fail.
Possible approaches:
\* Keep a global std::set of tids signalled: not quite perfect, because tid reuse is theoretically possible, unless we do something like block each thread in the signal handler (more DIY futex()ing? read()ing a pipe that the main thread closes?) until everything is done.
\* Thread local storage isn't async signal safe, so that won't work.
\* Take another signal and use its blocked bit as a per-thread boolean. That's kind of messy.
glibc does the same thing to implement setuid() and similar, but it doesn't have this problem because it can take a libc-internal lock that prevents concurrent thread creation/destruction.

Probably a non-issue for typical use cases? There's probably \*someone\* running desktop apps inside containers, but I'd tend to suspect it's not common. I only found out about this because someone was trying to get started with desktop sandboxing and was working inside a container (and was looking at the seccomp-bpf state as reported in /proc).
With that in mind, since it seems hard to justify actually fixing this, a simpler approach would be to at least make it fail closed instead of open: adjust the feature tests in SandboxInfo.cpp to report no seccomp-bpf support if the initial state isn't 0 and there's no tsync support. (This would want a log message and a pointer back to this bug so it's not just silently disabling things.)Flags: needinfo?(jld)

Hi Jed, based on [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1257361#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox doesn't actually enable GMP sandboxing if started with a seccomp-bpf filter already applied"), it's unclear if you feel this should be addressed. On one hand, you mention this might be hard to justify fixing, but then suggest a code change. That would qualify, to me, as a potential fix that we'd want (and possibly file a new bug for). Can you shed more light? Thank you.Flags: needinfo?(jld)

Assuming we don't have this problem with SECCOMP\_FILTER\_FLAG\_TSYNC-enabled kernels, the question is how important is it for the sandbox to work correctly on older kernels where an exist seccomp filter has been applied.
From what Jed explained and what I can see in the code, although not proven, this problem shouldn't occur on kernel's that support SECCOMP\_FILTER\_FLAG\_TSYNC which allows a filter to be reliably applied to all threads in a process. Given that, I think this is low priority. I'd agree that it's probably a non-issue for most users, but we never know how much LXC or environments where Firefox runs with an existing filter will be used in the future. Once we have 1098428, we should know what percentage of our Linux users run kernels with SECCOMP\_FILTER\_FLAG\_TSYNC.
Which kernels have SECCOMP\_FILTER\_FLAG\_TSYNC? That support appears to have gone into Linux kernel version 3.17 [1]. From wikipedia, all supported versions of Ubuntu have kernel 3.2 or newer [2]. Though Debian stable appears to be on 3.16 without this feature [3].
As far as resolving this, could we go along way by just changing SetThreadSandbox to call InstallSyscallFilter even when a filter is already applied yet still return false? It's not perfect, but it seems to me it would solve the LXC problem for older kernels leaving just a small window where threads could be created without our policy applied.

The thing I'd like to see fixed (and had been trying to avoid volunteering to do, because at least at first it seemed like a lot of work) is having a case where sandboxing seems to be enabled but actually isn't. So, that could be fixed either by making sandboxing work in that case or by correctly reporting that it won't work. The latter is relatively easy, and the former might be much easier than I thought (see the end of this comment).

Ubuntu's 3.13 branch has it. That means Ubuntu 14.04 “Trusty Tahr”, and according to <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack> should also include 12.04 “Precise Pangolin” iff it was installed as 12.04.2 or newer (but not 12.04.[01] systems upgraded to the same newer patchlevels; yes, this is confusing). It's the same set of Ubuntu instances as unprivileged user namespaces, I think (see [bug 1041885](/show_bug.cgi?id=1041885 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Import Chromium setuid sandbox"), but some of the early comments there are wrong and superseded by later ones).

Wouldn't that try to apply the filter twice to every thread under normal circumstances? And that would raise SIGSYS, because our filter doesn't allow… oh.
So here's another idea: the filter can make prctl(PR\_SET\_SECCOMP, 2, \_) return an error that wouldn't normally happen, and then the threads can just go ahead and call it and see if it succeeds.Flags: needinfo?(jld)

I think that's a cool idea. It's slightly imperfect because the existing policy could also have prctl return whatever value is chosen by us, but as a workaround for lack of SECCOMP\_FILTER\_FLAG\_TSYNC, it is probably good enough.

It's both less and more simple than I thought. Intercepting PR\_SET\_SECCOMP can be done, and I can even use statically allocate the `struct sock\_fprog` so the filter can excuse only our own seccomp-bpf filter but still trap any library that tries to use seccomp-bpf on its own, which is useful.
But the first thing we do is prctl(PR\_SET\_NO\_NEW\_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0) — a prerequisite for being allowed to use seccomp-bpf — so (1) my first patch broke GMP because we have a default-deny policy for prctl there, and (2) the double-filter prevention can just catch the PR\_SET\_NO\_NEW\_PRIVS instead.

Something I noticed after I wrote this patch: the sandbox rule that allows PR\_GET\_SECCOMP can be removed now. It's probably harmless, but no need to allow it if nothing is using it.

Patch: intercept PR\_SET\_NO\_NEW\_PRIVS
Yes, let's try to get this on 52 for ESR.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: This bug goes back to the original seccomp-bpf sandboxing in the B2G era; specifically, [bug 970676](/show_bug.cgi?id=970676 "RESOLVED FIXED - bionic doesn't setuid() on threads").
[User impact if declined]: A silent lack of sandboxing for media plugins. Limited to users running Linux Firefox inside certain kinds of containers (or something that applies a seccomp-bpf policy); this may be more common on ESR than regular Release.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Media plugin tests will cover it.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Yes; it's been on Nightly since 2016-12-12.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: I've manually tested; I don't think QE needs to verify. (There is STR, but it's complicated and uses a small C program that I haven't attached to this bug yet.)
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.
[Is the change risky?]: Not particularly.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The patch is subtle, but (1) in the absolute worst case the damage is limited to media plugins (OpenH264 and EME) on Linux, and (2) this patch has been on Nightly for ~2 months now, and on Aurora since the last merge.
[String changes made/needed]: None.
Incidentally, this patch was uplifted to the 52 branch and then immediately backed out. I'm not quite sure what was going on there, but see <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-aurora&revision=2f4972fb62ed> and <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-aurora&revision=b54a7014e03d>. (The build breakages were caused by the patch that mentions minidump-analyzer, not this one.) I mention this in case there are tools that would get confused by those earlier commits.Flags: needinfo?(jld)

Attached file
[C program that applies an allow-all seccomp-bpf policy](attachment.cgi?id=8835232)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8835232&action=edit)

STR, for the record:
1. Compile this program ("cc -Wall -o seccomp-null seccomp-null.c" or similar)
2. MOZ\_FAKE\_NO\_SECCOMP\_TSYNC=1 MOZ\_ASSUME\_USER\_NS=0 /path/to/seccomp-null ./mach run
(The env vars disable using features of newer kernels that will, respectively, make the bug not reproduce or make it completely break GMP instead of silently lowering security.)
3. Launch a media plugin:
3a. Wait for OpenH264 to download if it isn't already (check about:addons)
3b. Go to <https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/pc_test.html>
3c. Check “Require H.264”
3d. Start a chat
3e. Make sure the video loopback is working
4. gdb -p $(pgrep -f geckomediaplugin) --batch -ex 'call reboot(1)'
(This assumes there's only Gecko media plugin running anywhere on the system; if not, find the right one's pid and use it directly. I'm also assuming that any system security features that restrict debugging are disabled.)
4a. Expected result: plugin crash, "sandbox violation" message on terminal (after a few seconds of frozen video while gdb starts up)
4b. Bad result: gdb says "$1 = -1", plugin continues running
4c. Inconclusive result: gdb prints errors and immediately exits

The GMP sandbox profile includes the following regex to allow access to files in /private/var.
From security/sandbox/mac/Sandbox.mm,
135 "(allow file-read\*\n"
...
138 " (regex #\"^/(private/)?var($|/)\")\n"
It's unlikely we need to allow read access to the entire /private/var directory tree which contains sensitive state from programs that use /private/var to store data. One example of private information being stored here is images received by text message through the OS X Messages app:
/private/var/folders/.../com.apple.iChat/Messages/Images/<UUID>.jpg
The GMP process shouldn't be able to read personal pictures.
On OS X, the value of $TMPDIR is /var/folders/... where /var is a symlink to /private/var so the regex includes $TMPDIR which may be widely used. We should try to limit the regex to only include subdirectories we need.
Impact on the current \_content\_ sandbox is TBD. The content sandbox does allow access to some files in /private/var using regex that are much more constrained. I'd like to do another audit focusing on /private/var to confirm how much we allow. Here's a list of files paths that I previously generated.

I couldn't find any indication that the GMP child process needs to be allowed to read from /private/var, but tests with the regex removed hit try failures when the profile was stored in /var/folders because the plugin library couldn't be loaded. (/var is a symlink to /private/var on OS X.)
When the GMP child process is launched, the first argument on the command line is a directory within the profile that contains the plugin dylib file (such as libwidevinecdm.dylib). The child process needs to be able to read the plugin binary from that directory in order to load the dylib. The loading of the dylib happens after the sandbox is enabled. This happens in GMPLoaderImpl::Load() where first we call mSandboxStarter->Start(aUTF8LibPath) and then later PR\_LoadLibraryWithFlags(...).
The GMP child sandbox definition is modified at run time (before being applied) to include read permission of the full path to the dylib, which is derived from the directory passed to the GMP child process. On the failing try tests, the profile was being stored in /var/folders. An example dylib path is
/var/folders/tg/r664rfr17rsdq6gszpzv8rzm00000w/T/
tmpAxetwF.mozrunner/plugins/gmp-fakeopenh264/1.0/libfakeopenh264.dylib
As a result, the sandbox definition would include
(allow file-read\*
...
(regex #"^/(private/)?var($|/)")
...
(literal "/var/folders/tg/r664rfr17rsdq6gszpzv8rzm00000w/T/
tmpAxetwF.mozrunner/plugins/gmp-fakeopenh264/1.0/libfakeopenh264.dylib")
...
For a profile in /private/var/, the "literal" rule doesn't grant the necessary permission to read the dylib. The dylib can be loaded because the regex permits it. To allow the path, the OS sandbox implementation needs to be able to read /var to determine it is a symlink to /private/var. And then it needs permission to read the file at /private/var/.../.dylib. The regex allows reading of /var and it allows reading of any path starting with /private/var/. As a result, removing the regex breaks the dylib loading for profiles in /var/folders.
We need the literal rule to be the path to the dylib with all symlinks resolved like what realpath(3) provides. In GMPChild.cpp:GetPluginPaths(), we have the following
// Mac sandbox rules expect paths to actual files and directories -- not
// soft links.
aPluginDirectoryPath = GetNativeTarget(libDirectory);
aPluginFilePath = GetNativeTarget(libFile);
but GetNativeTarget() only checks if the full path refers to a symlink, not if any directories earlier in the path are symlinks. nsIFile includes a Normalize() method that calls realpath on OS X and we can use that to solve this problem. With the additional Normalize() calls and the /private/var regex removed, try results were clean and manual browsing using the GMP process appeared to work. With the fix, the GMP sandbox definition ends up with
(allow file-read\*
...
(literal "/private/var/folders/tg/r664rfr17rsdq6gszpzv8rzm00000w/T/
tmpAxetwF.mozrunner/plugins/gmp-fakeopenh264/1.0/libfakeopenh264.dylib")
...
Try results:
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=119f96c45ae49fbf11dd43d17770aa13b6cbd5db>
So far testing included runs on OS X 10.10 on try and OS X 10.12 manually. I plan to test on 10.9 and 10.11 as well.

Thanks. I'm the Mac sandbox module owner. I thought someone from media should OK this.

Removes /private/var regex from the GMP Sandbox
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Long standing GMP sandbox bug.
[User impact if declined]:
If a GMP plugin process was compromised, the sandbox would allow the process to read some private data from /private/var. This is where some temp files are stored, including pictures from picture messages. Requires a GMP exploit or malicious plugin before this bug can have an impact.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Partially. Issues with media playback aren't always caught by our automated tests.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Requesting QE run manual tests to validate that Netflix and Amazon video streaming still works for each version of OS X that we support. I've manually tested on OS X 10.12 and 10.11.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
None.
[Is the change risky?]:
Medium risk. The GMP sandbox is used for Netflix and Amazon streaming.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
We don't know exactly which paths the closed-source plugins (that are run in the GMP sandbox) need access to, but automated and manual tests haven't revealed any problems with this change on Nightly.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.
