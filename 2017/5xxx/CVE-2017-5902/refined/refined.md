Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-5902:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper or disabled TLS certificate validation within the "PayQuicker" iOS application.
*  **Weakness:** The application does not properly validate the TLS certificate presented by the server, allowing it to accept invalid certificates. This is also known as a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  A MITM attacker can intercept and potentially manipulate network traffic between the "PayQuicker" app and its servers. This includes the ability to steal login credentials and potentially other sensitive data transmitted by the app.
*   **Attack Vector:** A physically proximate attacker (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network) or an attacker with a privileged network position (e.g., controlling a router) can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the app's traffic.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic, which can be achieved by being on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim or having control over a network device that the traffic passes through. They would need to set up a rogue access point or use a tool to perform the man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Specific details:** The application, version 1.0.0, transmits username and password data to `mobileapi.payquicker.com/account/summary/` without proper TLS certificate validation.
*   **Status:** The vulnerability has not been fixed as of the date of the article.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article discusses a broader issue of TLS certificate validation vulnerabilities across multiple iOS applications. CVE-2017-5902 is one of the many CVEs associated with these vulnerabilities.
*   The article emphasizes that even with TLS, vulnerabilities can be introduced by improper certificate validation in the app itself.
*   The article suggests users should update apps and limit usage of vulnerable applications until a patch is available.
