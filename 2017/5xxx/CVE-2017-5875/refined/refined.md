Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5875:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Reflected XSS vulnerability in the `/dotCMS/myAccount` endpoint via the `addressID` parameter.
*   The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before reflecting it in the HTTP response.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when the victim visits a crafted URL.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the XSS payload embedded in the `addressID` parameter of a POST request to `/dotCMS/myAccount`.
*   The victim needs to be tricked into visiting the crafted URL. This could be done via phishing emails or by posting the URL on public forums, for example.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
*   The attacker needs to lure a victim into visiting the crafted URL while the victim is logged in to the application.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters (`addressID` in this instance).
*   Although not explicit in the vulnerability description, the advisory and issue details indicate an authenticated user is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided content includes examples of other similar XSS vulnerabilities affecting other dotCMS parameters:
    * `date` parameter in `/news-events/events/` (CVE-2017-5876)
    * `direction` parameter in `/about-us/locations/index` (CVE-2017-5877)
*   The provided GitHub issue link offers additional details about the vulnerability and the exploit.
*   The CVSS score is 5.4 (Moderate) indicating the vulnerability has a moderate impact on confidentiality and integrity.
*   The EPSS score is 0.065%, indicating a low probability of exploitation within the next 30 days.
* The issue was assigned CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))

In summary, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS that occurs because user-supplied input is not sanitized before being reflected in the application's response. This vulnerability can be exploited by luring an authenticated user to a maliciously crafted link, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
