## Description

[![@Belladona-c0re](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7010771?u=33ff5614458933cd5c7a84d871564e2671dc77b3&v=4&size=48)](/Belladona-c0re)[Belladona-c0re](https://github.com/Belladona-c0re)opened [on Feb 6, 2017](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/10643#issue-205525702)

The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it

back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an

attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable

web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and

executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering

malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is

posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed

in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby

an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a

vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back

to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
