Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5509:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content confirms that the identified vulnerability relates to CVE-2017-5509. The vulnerability is described as an "out-of-bounds write flaw in psd file handling" within the `coders/psd.c` file. Multiple sources, including the Debian bug tracker (#851377) and the oss-security mailing list, link this description to the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an out-of-bounds write in `coders/psd.c` during the processing of PSD files. The specific location where this occurs seems to be within the `WritePSDChannel` and related functions, particularly concerning how RLE compression is handled. The Valgrind output from the provided github issue report #350 shows the invalid write occurring in `PSDPackbitsEncodeImage`, which is called by `WritePSDChannel`.
Specifically the issue is in `AcquireCompactPixels` where memory is allocated for the compressed data and in the related `WritePSDChannel` function the data is written to that memory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is writing data beyond the allocated buffer in memory. This is evident from the valgrind logs that indicate "Invalid write of size 1" at various addresses which are located "bytes after a block of size n alloc'd".
*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption as it overwrites adjacent memory regions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption**: Exploitation can lead to arbitrary memory corruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The valgrind output from the provided github issue report shows that the memory corruption ultimately leads to the program terminating with signal 6 (SIGABRT) causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if the overwritten memory contains executable code or is used in a way that can be controlled by the attacker.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PSD File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PSD image file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by ImageMagick.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PSD file to a system running ImageMagick. This could be done by:
    *   Uploading the malicious file to a web server that uses ImageMagick for image processing.
    *   Sending the file as an email attachment.
    *   Persuading a user to open the file locally using an application that relies on ImageMagick.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

*   The vulnerability was found using Valgrind, a memory error detector, while processing a crafted PSD file.
*   The issue was reported and fixed in a relatively short timeframe.
*   The fix involved checks and correction in how data is handled during RLE compression.
*   The issue affects multiple versions of ImageMagick, including versions in Debian's stable and unstable branches.

**Summary of technical details:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of compressed data when writing PSD files, causing writes past the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption and potential denial of service. An attacker needs a specially crafted PSD file to trigger the out-of-bounds write.
