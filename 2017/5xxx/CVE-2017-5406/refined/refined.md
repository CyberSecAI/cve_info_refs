Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5406:

**CVE-2017-5406: Segmentation fault in Skia with canvas operations**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a segmentation fault within the Skia graphics library. It occurs during certain canvas operations due to problems with how mask/clip intersections and empty masks are handled.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The core issue lies in the Skia library's implementation of `SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow_SSE2`, specifically within `SkBlitMask_D32.cpp` when handling canvas operations.
    *   The problem is triggered by specific sequences of operations involving text rendering and masks.
    *   The crash happens during the blitting operation (copying pixel data) when dealing with LCD rendered text with masks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The most immediate impact is a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the application.
    *  The crash itself is not specified to be exploitable for arbitrary code execution, but a denial of service is possible.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered through web content rendered using the `<canvas>` element, particularly when text drawing and clipping masks are combined.
    *   An attacker can craft a specific sequence of canvas commands that lead to the crash.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to load a webpage within the vulnerable browser that can execute the malicious canvas operations.
    *   No special privileges or system access is required, just the ability to serve web content.

**Additional Technical Details (From Bugzilla):**

*   The crash occurs within the `SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow_SSE2` function, when drawing text using Skia, specifically when handling a mask.
*   The crash occurs on the line 459 of `SkBlitRow_opts_SSE2.cpp` file
*   The issue was resolved by updating Skia to milestone 55 branch.
* The issue appears to be triggered when a text node inside SVG is drawn.

**Summary**

CVE-2017-5406 describes a high severity vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox related to a segmentation fault in the Skia graphics library. This crash can be triggered by a maliciously crafted webpage which use canvas operations, including text rendering and clipping, leading to a denial of service for the user. The root cause is a coding error in `SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow_SSE2` function which causes a crash when drawing text with certain masks. The fix involves updating the Skia library to a version which does not have this crash.
