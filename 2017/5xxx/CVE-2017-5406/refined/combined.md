#### [#CVE-2017-5422: DOS attack by using view-source: protocol repeatedly in one hyperlink](#CVE-2017-5422)

Reporter
Alex Bolton

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Carsten Book, Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, David Bolter, David Keeler, Jon Coppeard, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Tooru Fujisawa, Ben Kelly, Bob Owen, Jed Davis, Julian Seward, Julian Hector, Philipp, Markus Stange, and André Bargull reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 51. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

I can reproduce this test case in my local gecko-dev build, with Mac. The attached file was the back trace I saw. I am not sure if it hit the same issue because the backtrace was not totally the same between this.

That trace looks like OOM to me.

From my point-of-view, that crash is OOM, so we can wait until this issue is fixed and see if it still reproduces.
It might be that it is the same underlying issue, but because of different prefs or lack of ASAN it is not triggered in the same place.Flags: needinfo?(attekett)

I'd established ASAN build on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I also put prefs.js into "gecko-dev/browser/app/profile/" in the latest central. After that, I still see the attached crash information.

I was able to reproduce both the issue Atte initially reported using an optimized ASan build and the issue noted in [comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1306890#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow_SSE2") using an ASan debug build. In both cases I used the prefs.js file from the report. It seems that the test case triggers a skia assertion before hitting the SEGV Atte reported.
Vincent, please retry with a non debug ASan build and that \*should\* allow you to reproduce the issue.

Thanks for your information and my optimized Asan build had SEGV crash in SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow\_SSE2.
Took time to look into this and found it crashed in the same function when I saw it on the debug Asan build or even on my mac.
The attached patch can fix this issue when I saw it under debug build. It also works ​on Asan release build. Maybe you can also try this WIP. But more better solution would be applied into central by next skia upstream by updating Skia to the milestone 55 branch in [1].

As [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1306890#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in SkBlitLCD16OpaqueRow_SSE2") said, skia upstream by updating Skia to the milestone 55 would fix this issue. The detailed about Skia upstream saw in [bug 1299435](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299435 "VERIFIED FIXED - Update Skia to m55 branch"). I'd also tried the latest Asan build and confirms this bug has been fixed. You can also get the latest build to make sure it. I will close this bug.

Better to make this "FIXED, depends on" rather than a dupe so we don't lose track of the fact that a security bug was fixed, and may need backporting.
Does this affect ESR-45? Or did that build not use Skia in the same ways?

Per [bug 1299435](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299435 "VERIFIED FIXED - Update Skia to m55 branch"), let updating Skia to m55 branch ride the train. Mark 51 as fix-optional.

We only started using Skia for content rendering in 51, so ESR-45 is unaffected.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Using local trunk builds on Linux, this is a null-pointer crash in both debug and opt builds.
We crash when we get a call to nsRange::UnregisterCommonAncestor with aNode=null.
In a debug build, there's a bunch of "disconnected nodes" assertions leading up to the crash:
ASSERTION: unexpected disconnected nodes: 'aDisconnected', file dom/base/nsContentUtils.cpp, line 2433
...

The root cause here is that we set up the Range in the Selection with one
node inside a native anonymous tree and one node outside. It's the NAC
<div> inside the <progress> element. Then we destroy the <progress> frame
and create a AnonymousContentDestroyer, which when it runs calls
UnbindFromTree on the NAC. The Range isn't notified about this though
so now it has a NAC boundary point with a null parent. Now, CC detects
that it can collect both the Range+Selection and calls nsRange::Reset,
which calls nsRange::DoSetRange which tries to unregister the Range on
the GetCommonAncestor() node but it's null due to the NAC's null parent.
The result is a node in the tree referring to a deallocated nsRange.
The root cause is basically [bug 1329658](/show_bug.cgi?id=1329658 "NEW - Selecting content using SHIFT+UP/DOWN is broken for content that contains form controls"). I fixed char/word movement
in [bug 1328030](/show_bug.cgi?id=1328030 "RESOLVED FIXED - Drag selection(word by word selection) is broken if input is there") but line movement remains to be fixed. I wasn't aware
this could lead to UAF at the time though.
We could also try to make nsRange more robust against this by falling
back to checking all ancestors of the non-NAC node. Or, simply storing
the common ancestor node on the nsRange so that it can always be found
later when we need to unregister.
> Mats, are you able to work on this?
Generally, I think the DOM team now owns the Range & Selection code.
And I feel like these bugs take too much of my time.
I can take a look a making GetCommonAncestor() try harder in this
case to wallpaper it, which seems reasonably simple. But I'll leave
[bug 1329658](/show_bug.cgi?id=1329658 "NEW - Selecting content using SHIFT+UP/DOWN is broken for content that contains form controls") for someone else. (I left some pointers on what code to
fix there.)Flags: needinfo?(mats)

Attached patch

[fix](attachment.cgi?id=8841503&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8841503&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1340138&attachment=8841503)

It looks like the "enabler" for this bug is [bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore"), which made
nsFind::Find return ranges with mMaySpanAnonymousSubtrees = true
which the caller then adds to the Selection. This range can then
be exploited by making it span into a NAC tree since that flag
disables the defense we have for that in nsRange::IsValidBoundary:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/b1044cf7c2000c3e75e8181e893236a940c8b6d2/dom/base/nsRange.cpp#1156>
I don't think setting mMaySpanAnonymousSubtrees was actually needed
for window.find() to fix [bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore") in the first place, it looks
like an unintentional side-effect. And there's actually no need
to \_return\_ a result range with that flag at all AFAICT, it's just
needed for the internal ranges nsFindContentIterator uses, and
only for the specific case of searching in unstyled XML.

Those ranges are only used internally, never exposed to DOM or added to a Selection.
Since they're not in a Selection, they aren't registered on a DOM node and thus
don't suffer from this bug.

BTW, nsFind is still the only place that set mMaySpanAnonymousSubtrees AFAICT
(apart from CloneRange), so this patch is complete in the sense that there's
no other way to expose such a range to DOM:

Ok, why do we then need to change nsWebBrowserFind::SearchInFrame? Those ranges aren't added to selection either.

Because they don't need that flag and I moved nsFind::CreateRange to the protected

block frames as far as I know, so this code will never result in a matching range that spans
a NAC to non-NAC. If it's inside a NAC tree then I think the result already has the right
root, and nsRange::IsValidBoundary will also do the right thing:

Move CreateRange to the iterator class and make it private there.

[Security approval request comment]
>How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I suspect it's hard, the only clue is that it has something to do
with DOM ranges. If you spend some time backtracking how this code
is used you can probably figure out that window.find() is using it.
But from there you'd still have to find a way to modify that range
to get one of the end points inside native anonymous content and
then destroy that node to get the condition for a crash.
>Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No, see above.
>Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
>Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I'm pretty sure the current patch applies as is to branches.
>How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This code is used by window.find(), Find(CTRL+F) and FAYT (find-as-you-type).
The mMaySpanAnonymousSubtrees flag isn't needed for normal web pages,
so it seems pretty unlikely to affect that.
I've tested that searching in unstyled XML content still works using
a local Linux debug build, but if QA can verify that on other platforms
would be good ([bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore") has an example in the URL field).
Testing Find(CTRL+F) and FAYT and anything else that involves searching
for text in the web page contents would be appreciated.

This close to shipping (no more betas) we need to be more sure than that. I can sec-approve this but not grant beta approval at this point. If we can't get beta approval I'd rather this didn't land until a couple weeks after the merge.

sec-approval=dveditz, but DO NOT LAND on nightly unless we get beta approval for 52 (please fill out the request). If we don't make it into 52 we might get this as a ride-along in a point update, and Fx53 will still beat the Project Zero disclosure date.

The files is under embedding/ in Beta rather than toolkit/ but the code
is the same. I've verified it fixes the crash on Beta too.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore")
[User impact if declined]: exploitable crash
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: I can't find any feature tests for window.find(). I suspect we have some for Find/FAYT, but I'm not sure.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:no, not landed in Nightly yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Yes, it would be good to test Find(CTRL+F) and FAYT (find-as-you-type), both in normal web pages and in XML source (see URL in [bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore")), just as a sanity check.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: no
[Is the change risky?]:low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: we only removed setting the mMaySpanAnonymousSubtrees flag in some places, which shouldn't be needed for most use cases (i.e. search in normal web content), only for searching in unstyled XML documents ([bug 384706](/show_bug.cgi?id=384706 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Searching text in xml pretty print doesn't work anymore")), so it's pretty limited to that rare edge case
[String changes made/needed]:none

Can you also request uplift to mozilla-release since we already did the beta to release merge?
I think we may also need separate patches for esr-45 and esr-52. I would like to start the esr52 build today if possible.
