Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5642:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-5642

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** During the installation of Ambari Server, the server artifacts were not created with the correct Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect file system permissions on Ambari server artifacts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access or modification of Ambari Server artifacts is possible due to the missing or incorrect ACLs, potentially leading to compromise of the Ambari server and its hosted services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the Ambari server host.
- An attacker may exploit this vulnerability if they have access to the server's file system and can manipulate the artifacts due to the weak ACLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the file system of the server where the Ambari server is running.
- The attacker must have sufficient permissions to read and/or modify the affected artifacts based on the insufficient ACLs.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Ambari versions 2.4.3 and 2.5.0.
- A script was provided with version 2.5.0 to correct the ACLs for systems running vulnerable versions (2.4.0 to 2.4.2). This script is available at: `https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/release-2.5.0/ambari-server/src/main/resources/scripts/check_ambari_permissions.py`
