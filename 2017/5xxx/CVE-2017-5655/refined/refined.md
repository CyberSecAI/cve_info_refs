**CVE-2017-5655: Possible exposure of sensitive data in files created in Ambari temp directory when downloading configurations**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive data is stored on disk in temporary files on the Ambari Server host when downloading configurations. These temporary files are not properly protected and are readable by any user authenticated on the host.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of sensitive data in temporary files, insufficient access control on temporary files.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  Exposure of sensitive data to any authenticated user on the Ambari Server host.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with valid credentials on the host running the Ambari server can read the temporary files containing sensitive information.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the host where the Ambari Server is running.

The vulnerability is fixed in Ambari versions 2.4.3 and 2.5.1, which restricts access to the temporary files to the user executing the Ambari server process. It is also recommended to remove these temporary files when they are no longer needed.
