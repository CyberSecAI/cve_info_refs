Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of non-constant-time comparison algorithms for user passwords within the `RT::Authen::ExternalAuth` module in Request Tracker (RT).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Side-Channel Attack:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to timing side-channel attacks. By carefully measuring the time taken for login attempts, an attacker can potentially deduce information about the correct password, even over the internet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially crack user passwords by exploiting the timing differences in password comparisons. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts within the Request Tracker system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet by an attacker.
- The attacker needs to perform a large number of login attempts, carefully measuring the time taken for each attempt.
- Only `ExternalAuth` in DBI (database) mode is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Request Tracker system.
- The attacker requires the ability to make a large number of login attempts to perform the timing analysis.
- The attacker does not require any privileged access before exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects RT versions 4.0.x, 4.2.x, and 4.4.x when using `RT::Authen::ExternalAuth` in DBI mode.
- The fix involves using a constant-time comparison algorithm for secrets.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Aaron Kondziela.
- A patch was released to address the issue for RT versions 4.0, 4.2, and 4.4 and also for `RT::Authen::ExternalAuth` versions 0.09 and later.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3882-1 and DSA-3883-1 address this issue, along with others, in Debian packages `request-tracker4` and `rt-authen-externalauth` respectively.
