{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow due to deeply nested YAML structures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `YAML::SingleDocParser::HandleNode` function recursively calls itself, leading to a stack overflow when processing a deeply nested YAML file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash due to a stack overflow, resulting in a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted YAML file with extremely deep nesting that triggers the vulnerability during parsing.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted YAML file to the vulnerable application for parsing."
