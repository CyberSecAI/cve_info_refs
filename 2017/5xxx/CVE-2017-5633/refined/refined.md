{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The D-Link DI-524 wireless router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The router does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that are then executed by the victim's browser when they visit a malicious webpage while authenticated to the router.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform actions as an authenticated user without the user's consent, such as: \n\t* Rebooting the device\n\t* Changing the admin password",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user of the D-Link DI-524 to visit a malicious website or click a crafted link. The malicious website/link contains a CSRF exploit that triggers actions on the router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or provide a malicious link, and the victim needs to be logged into the D-Link DI-524 router while visiting the malicious site/link. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.",
